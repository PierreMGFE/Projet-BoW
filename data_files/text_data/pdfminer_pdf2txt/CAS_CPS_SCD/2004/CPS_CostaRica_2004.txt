EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1 

Th is Country Partnership Strategy, wh ich covers FYs 04-07, i s the f i r s t t o be 
prepared fo r Costa R ica since 1993. Over the last decade, collaboration between Costa 
R ica and the Bank had been re la t ive ly limited, focused p r ima r i ly o n ensuring effective 
implementation o f a small po r t fo l io o f projects and the p rov is ion o f analytical and 
advisory services. This CPS, prepared at the request o f the Pacheco Adm in is t ra t ion wh ich 
took o f f ice in 2002, envisages a highly selective program o f lending and non-lending 
services, focused less on resource transfer objectives and mo re o n knowledge sharing and 
advisory services in areas o f mutual interest. The a im is t o focus cooperation in areas 
where (i) lessons f rom Costa Rica’s successful pove r ty reduction and economic 
diversification efforts and pioneering leadership in environmental management wou ld be 
instructive fo r other Bank clients; and (ii) the Bank’s g loba l experience cou ld support 
Costa Rica’s efforts to address second generation problems in key sectors. 
In i t s 
discussion o f this CPS, the Boa rd may w ish t o consider the fo l low ing : 

e D o Executive Directors agree w i t h the p r ima ry rationale f o r Bank engagement in 
Costa R ica - Le., mu tua l learning and knowledge sharing rather than significant 
resource transfer? 
A r e the size o f the program and the specific areaslinstruments chosen fo r Bank 
engagement appropriate t o further the CPS’s knowledge objectives? 

e 

ii 

Costa R i c a i s a development success story in many respects. The country has a 
long t rad i t ion o f po l i t ica l stability, w i t h successive democratically elected governments 
transitioning peacefully t o powe r since 1949. The p o l i t i c a l climate i s characterized b y 
well-established processes f o r consultation and consensus-building o n po l icy re fo rm 
which, 
in turn, have engendered social and po l i t ica l stability, contributed to the 
sustainability o f reforms and helped ma in ta in the c red ib i l i ty and accountability o f pub l ic 
institutions. Since the m id - l980s , Costa R ica has fo l lowed a successful strategy o f 
outward-oriented export-led growth, openness t o fo re ign investment and gradual trade 
liberalization. A s a result, the structure o f the economy has been transformed f rom one 
h igh ly dependent o n agriculture and agro-industry t o one that is n ow l e d by high-tech 
computer and electronic industries, services, non-traditional agriculture and tourism. The 
country has successfully attracted foreign direct investment, fueling economic growth, 
wh ich averaged 5 percent in the 1990s -well above the L a t i n Ame r ican average. The 
combination o f steady economic g row th and sustained investment in human development 
has led to a substantial reduc t ion in head-count poverty, and the country has already met 
o r i s w e l l o n the way to meeting the Millennium Development Goals. In the future, it i s 
expected that the free trade agreement recently negotiated with the United States w i l l 
further boost exports and attract new national and fo re ign investment.. 

iii 

A s the above suggests, Costa R ica i s in a strong pos i t ion v is a v i s i t s L a t i n 
American neighbors as i t enters the new century, but faces new issues and challenges as i t 
strives t o achieve continued sustainable growth, further reduce poverty and promote 
social equity in an increasingly integrated and competitive g loba l economy. T o address 

these challenges, the Government has iden t i f ied fou r m a i n areas o f emphasis fo r the 
com ing years -- maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening 
trade and 
competitiveness, sustaining social progress with particular attention 
to reaching 
indigenous and Afro-Costa Ricans, and con t inu ing Costa Rica’s 
leadership o n 
environmental issues. 

i v 
L i n k e d t o the above emphases, and tak ing in to account the lessons o f the CAS 
Comp le t ion Rev iew (Annex B la ) , the CPS includes a re la t ive ly modest lending program 
o f US$2 18 m i l l i o n f o r six projects over four years, focused on developing sustainable, 
innovative solutions t o the second-generation challenges be ing encountered in a number 
o f sectors. These include: (i) education, where govemment i s seek ing t o resolve 
rema in ing problems o f inequity and t o imp rove ove ra l l system efficiency; (ii) water and 
sanitation, where with JBIC, the Bank w i l l he lp establish modemized approaches t o 
imp rov ing coverage, quality and sustainability; environment, (iii) regional development 
in the Puerto L im o n area o n the Caribbean coast, through an operation aimed at 
rev i ta l iz ing the po r t and related infrastructure as a means o f reducing the region’s 
re la t ive ly high pove r ty rates and increasing the country’s ove ra l l competitiveness; (iv) a 
possible fo l low -on environmental project targeted t o imp rov ing f inanc ia l sustainability in 
the sector; (v) a small e-Government learning and innova t ion loan aimed at imp rov ing 
pub l ic sector efficiency; and (vi) an Ag r icu l tu re Sector p ro jec t designed to help 
smallholders fare adequately under the more competitive conditions w h i c h w i l l l i k e l y 
result f r om the C A F T A agreement. 

v. 
In add i t ion to the lending operations described, the CPS includes a substantial 
program o f knowledge and advisory services and analytical work. Fo r example, 
capacity-building activities on bo th a reimbursable and grant basis are foreseen to support 
reforms in c r i t ica l areas o f pub l ic sector debt management, domestic debt market 
development, f inanc ia l sector reform, Central B a n k management o f international reserves 
and management o f private pa r t ic ipa t ion in infrastructure. 
In addition, the Bank w i l l 
undertake a number o f economic and sector w o r k activities in cooperation w i t h the 
Government, inc lud ing the f i v e core diagnostic studies, an investment climate assessment 
and selected regional studies o n key issues f o r Central America. 

v i 
Specific indicators have been iden t i f ied f o r evaluating the results and impact o f 
the CPS. The results based approach i s l inked to the development challenges, to wh ich 
the government and a l l i t ’ s partners, inc lud ing the Bank Group, w i l l contribute. The m a i n 
risk concerns the potential f o r macro-economic instability, triggered b y external factors, 
deterioration o f the fiscal situation, a n d o r f inanc ia l system weaknesses. However, this 
risk i s judged t o be modest f o r the CPS period, given the country’s track record o f 
successfully weathering regional crises and enacting reforms and attracting funds on the 
capital markets when needed, the p reva i l ing broad consensus and agreement in the 
Na t iona l Assembly o n the need f o r f isca l re fo rm (although details are s t i l l being worked 
out), and the steps taken in the past tw o o r so years t o strengthen the regulatory and 
prudential f ramewo rk o f the f inanc ia l system and recapitalize the Central Bank, thereby 
s ign i f ican t ly lowe r ing the risk o f a bank ing o r f inanc ia l crisis.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
ON A COUNTRY PARTICIPATION STRATEGY FOR THE 
REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1 . 

The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r the Republic o f Costa R ica was 
presented to the Boa rd in Ma rch 1993, together with an adjustment operation aimed at 
continued re fo rm o f pub l ic sector management, the financial sector and trade. That 
operation was cancelled two years later and since then, the collaboration between Costa 
R ica and the Bank has been relatively limited, focused p r ima r i ly o n ensuring effective 
implementation o f a small po r t fo l io o f projects (in health, education, environmental 
services and water and sanitation) and the p rov is ion o f non-lending analytical and 
advisory services. Despite the scaling back o f Bank f inanc ia l support Costa R i c a 
advanced significantly in achieving many o f the objectives l a i d out in the 1993 CAS . 
The Pacheco Administration, wh ich took o f f ice in mid-2002, has indicated strong interest 
in fo rg ing a closer relationship w i t h the Bank, leading t o the development o f this new 
CPS after a pe r iod o f over 10 years. Th is CPS envisages a h igh ly selective program o f 
lending and non-lending services, focused l e s s o n resource transfer objectives and mo re 
o n knowledge sharing and advisory services in areas o f mutual in te res t - Le., areas where 
lessons f rom Costa Rica’s successful pove r ty reduction and economic d ive rs i f ica t ion 
efforts and pioneering leadership in environmental management wou ld be instructive f o r 
other Bank clients, as w e l l as areas in wh ich the Bank’s g loba l experience cou ld bene f i t 
Costa Rica’s efforts to address second generation problems in key sectors. 

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2. 
Costa R ica i s a development success story in many respects. A middle-income 
country o f about 3.9 m i l l i o n people, Costa R ica boasts one o f the most stable 
democracies in L a t i n America, with uninterrupted democratically elected governments 
since 1949. Several factors have contributed t o this stability, inc lud ing the l im i t e d 
presence and powe r o f land-based oligarchies, the existence o f effective social m o b i l i t y 
mechanisms, the abo l i t ion o f the army after a b r i e f c i v i l war in 1948, the enactment o f a 
new constitution in 1949, and the foundation o f one o f the region’s f i r s t welfare states. 
The President and a Leg is la t ive Assembly comprised o f 57 legislators are elected f o r 4 
year terms. T w o ma jo r po l i t ica l parties have generally alternated in power, although the 
country has seen greater po l i t ica l d ive rs i ty in recent years, with the rise o f a number o f 
smaller parties. Costa Rica’s government and po l i t ics have l o n g placed a high premium 
o n achievement o f w ide socio-political consensus o n ma jo r policies. W h i l e sometimes 
delaying decisions, this emphasis o n consensus has the advantages o f creating a b road 
social base, enhancing the sustainability o f economic and social reforms and helping to 
ma in ta in the c red ib i l i ty and accountability o f pub l ic institutions. 

3. 
Since the mid-l980s, Costa R ica has fo l lowed a successful strategy o f outward- 
oriented export-led growth, openness t o 
fo re ign investment and gradual trade 
liberalization. As a result, the structure o f exports and the economy i t s e l f has been 
transformed f r om one highly dependent o n agriculture and agro-industry - coffee and 
bananas represented 56 percent o f exports in 1985 vs. o n l y 12 percent in 2003 - to one 
that is now led b y high-tech computer and electronic industries, services, non-traditional 
agriculture and tourism. The ra t io o f exports to GDP grew f r om 20.8 percent in 1991 to 
36.5 percent in 2000, and greater trade openness contributed greatly t o g row th during the 
decade. Costa R ica attracts foreign direct investment at a rate o f about 3 percent o f GDP 
annually, and has been successful in attracting high-tech investors such as INTEL. As a 
result, the economy grew by an average 5 percent rate in the 1990s, w i t h factor 
p roduc t iv i ty accounting fo r tw o fifths o f th is performance, In the future, i t i s expected 
that the free trade agreement recently negotiated with the U n i t e d States (know as Central 
America Free Trade Agreement o r CAFTA ) w i l l further boost exports and attract new 
national and fo re ign investment, increasing the country’s development prospects. 

4. 
At least in part, Costa Rica’s rap id p roduc t iv i ty g row th and attractiveness t o 
investors i s the result o f sustained investment in the education and health o f i t s population 
over the past two decades. The country’s social indicators are currently closer to those 
p reva i l ing in developed countries, far above the n o rm f o r countries w i t h s im i la r per capita 
GDP ($4,193 in 2003). Coverage o f basic education and health care services i s nearly 
universal today, although there have been some signs in recent years that the efficiency 
and effectiveness o f social spending has begun t o plateau, or, in some cases (e.g., 
secondary education), has actually suffered some decline. Continued improvements in 
social areas w i l l have to rely on be t ter use o f expenditures, as the scope fo r further 
increases in social spending is likely t o be limited by f isca l and f inanc ia l constraints. 

5. 

The combination o f respectable economic growth, re la t ive ly l o w inequality along 
bo th gender and class l ines , and large investments in human development have led t o a 
substantial reduction in head-count pove r ty in Costa R i c a over t h e past decade. 
Headcount pove r ty declined f r om 3 1.9 percent in 1991 t o 20.6 percent in 2000, wh i le the 
proportion o f the population l i v i n g in extreme poverty f e l l f r om 11.7 percent to 6.1 
percent during the same period. A f te r stagnating f o r several years, during wh ich time the 
numbers o f poo r immigrants entering the country f r om Nicaragua accelerated, 
the 
poverty rate f e l l sharply in 2003, probably due t o the p ick -up in GDP growth. 

6. 

Table 1, below, shows Costa Rica’s progress with regard t o the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). The indicators measured there clearly re f lec t the country’s 
notably strong development performance o n a number o f dimensions over the past tw o o r 
so decades. Wh i le continued improvements are necessary in some areas -and these cou ld 
be more d i f f i c u l t t o achieve as “easier” milestones have already past - the Government i s 
w e l l aware o f the challenges ahead and is w o r k i n g t o bring about the po l i t ica l consensus 
needed to move fo rwa rd w i t h needed reforms. Recent developments in Costa R ica and 
some o f the specific challenges faced by the country in the medium-term are discussed 
further in Sections 111 and I V o f this document.

Gender 
Cos ta R i c a has a lso made s ign i f ican t progress in c los ing gender 
d ispar i t ies . A reduc t ion in the t o t a l f e r t i l i t y ra te f r o m 7 ch i ld ren in the 1950s t o 2.8 in 
2000 has fac i l i ta ted women 's en t ry i n t o the labo r force, while t a k i n g the pressure o f f men

ac t ive popu la t ion , compa red t o 25 percen t o n average f o r Cen t ra l Am e r i c a n as a who le . 
Cos ta R i c a has also success fu l ly c losed the educa t ion gender gap, a l though some n e w 
d ispar i t ies are emerging, espec ia l ly at the secondary leve l . Cu r ren t ly en ro l lmen ts leve ls 
f o r ma les and fema les are r o u g h l y equa l at p r im a r y and te r t ia ry levels, but girls

In 2000, women 's salaries were 86.3 percen t tha t o f men's salaries, w h i c h i s a m u c h 
sma l ler gap than tha t p r e v a i l i n g in m a n y O E C D coun tr ies . L i f e expec tancy a t birth f o r 
females i s abou t 5 years h ighe r than f o r males, app rox ima t ing the d i f fe rence p r e v a i l i n g in 
h ighe r - income coun tr ies . Howeve r , there are gender issues w h i c h deserve c o n t i n u i n g 
p o l i c y a t ten t ion : (i) the re i s an inc reas ing share o f women - led househo lds among fam i l ies 

10 

living in extreme poverty; (ii) women, together with young adults (less than 25 years old) 
show the highest open unemployment rates; and (iii) the adolescent fe r t i l i ty rate o f 85 per 
1,000 in women aged 15-19 is greater than the average f o r L a t i n Ame r ica (75 pe r 1,000 
adolescent women). 

24. 
Social Inclusion Costa Rica’s success in reduc ing the pove r ty headcount - an 
undeniably significant achievement -- has n o t yet, however, overcome the social 
exclusion o f indigenous peoples and Costa Ricans o f A f r i c a n descent, who are 
d i ~ p r ~ ~ o r t i o n a t e l y 
represented among the poorest 5 percent o f Costa R ican households. 
Indigenous households, wh ich comprise about I .7 percent o f the Costa R ican population, 
s t i l l l i v e in conditions o f extreme poverty, about 42 percent in indigenous territories and 
the remainder in surrounding areas o r in urban centers (principally San Jose). In part, t h i s 
reflects the fact that the Na t iona l Commission f o r Indigenous A f f a i r s has no t been f i l l y 
effective in fulfilling i ts mandate o f defending indigenous r igh ts and coordinating across 
sectors t o ensure that development programs are adapted t o indigenous needs. The A f r o - 
Costa R ican population, too, continues t o be concentrated in the poorest parts o f the 
country ( L im o n province and the immediate vicinity). Wh i le a small m ino r i ty has 
attained social and f inanc ia l success and some impo r tan t advances are apparent in 
education and national po l i t ica l participation, i t remains the case that Afro-Costa Ricans, 
l i k e the country’s 
indigenous inhabitants, d i s p r o p o ~ i o n a t e l y experience l o w human 
capital development, high unemployment, and l im i t e d access t o infrastructure services. 

25, 
Ove r the past decade or so, Costa R i c a i s g rapp l ing with a new challenge t o i t s 
efforts t o reduce poverty and promote social inclusion- namely accelerating imm ig ra t ion 
f r om neighboring Nicaragua. Currently, 8.8 percent o f the popu la t ion i s of Nicaraguan 
origin.2 Thus far, Costa R i c a has shown a unique attitude within L A C countries in 
ma in ta in ing a po l icy o f social inc lus ion v i s a v i s Nicaraguan immigrants, inc lud ing 
p romo t ion o f respect f o r diversity and non-discrimination in labor polices and the 
p rov is ion o f social services. Despite these efforts, the welfare o f Nicaraguan migrants i s 
noticeably be low that o f the rest o f the Costa R ican population. Currently 7.1 percent o f 
Nicaraguan households in Costa R i c a l i v e in shanty-towns (versus 1.5 percent o f Costa 
R ican households), and on ly 38.8 percent o f ch i ld ren o f Nicaraguan o r i g i n aged between 
13-19 years attend school (versus 61.3 o f Costa R ican origin). To avert increasing social 
tension, renewed efforts are needed t o develop a coherent po l icy f ramewo rk t o deal with 
the fo rma l iza t ion o f immigrants and the adoption o f actions t o reduce opportunity gaps 
o f Nicaraguan immigrants in accessing education, housing and qua l i f ied employment, 
and reinforce a culture o f recognition and tolerance.

As discussed at the outset o f th is document, Costa Rica’s strong and sustained 
e f fo r t with respect t o strengthening social services has had important pay-offs f o r the 
welfare o f i ts population. Overall, the m a i n human development indicators are fa r above 
those o f neighboring countries and have shown considerable improvement over time: l i f e

International Finance Corporation IFC ’s strategy since the 1993 CAS was t o 
invest in viable manufacturing, education, infrastructure, tourism and f inanc ia l sector 
projects to help diversify the economy and support p r iva te sector growth. During this 
period, however, IFC ’s ac t iv i ty was limited due in part t o a considerable ro le that has 
been played b y the state sector in the economy, and significant pub l ic opposition t o 
reforms, wh ich inhibited further opening o f various sectors t o private participation. IFC’s 
strategy in the infrastructure sector has focused o n supporting viable projects that cou ld 
demonstrate the existence o f attractive p r iva te sector opportunities with a high 
developmental impact. Such i s the case o f the FYOl US$120 m i l l i o n ( inc lud ing US$85 
m i l l i o n f rom participants) committed investment f o r the Juan Santamaria International 
A i rpo r t project approved in FYOl -- IFC’s largest eve r investment in Costa Rica. Thus 
far, this investment has been affected b y uncertainties related t o the t a r i f f methodology, 
as the Contraloria issued a report inva l ida t ing some o f the costs inputs used by the 
government. Negotiations between the Government and the sponsors on this i s s u e are 
advancing. The outcome o f the negotiations w i l l l i k e l y have an impact on future private 
sector participation in other infrastructure projects. 

72. 
IFC ’s po r t fo l io , as at the end o f Novembe r 2003, amounted t o US$182 m i l l i o n 
(US$97 m i l l i o n fo r IFC ’s ow n account and US$85 m i l l i o n f o r the account o f participants) 
by the held balance (including the outstanding and the undisbursed). A large part o f the 
po r t fo l io consisted o f investments in infrastructure, re ta i l trade, and the f inanc ia l sector. 
During the FY99 -04 pe r iod (through November 2003)’ six projects have been committed 
to ta l ing US$212 m i l l i o n ( inc lud ing US$85 m i l l i o n fo r the account o f participants), in 
re ta i l trade, finance, health, infrastructure, and agribusiness. This includes the airport 
investment mentioned above and a FY 9 9 US$40 m i l l i o n f inanc ing to assist a Costa R ican 
re ta i l operation to expand, no t on ly in Costa R ica but to other Central American countries 
and the Dom in ican Republic. In November 2003, I F C also committed US$20 m i l l i o n 
f inanc ing f o r Banco Interfin, a leading p r iva te sector bank in Costa Rica. The 
investment, wh ich fo l lowed IFC’s tw o previous credit l i n e s p r ima r i ly fo r SME on- 
lending, US$5 m i l l i o n in FY 9 3 ( fu l ly repaid) and US$15 m i l l i o n in FYO 1, w o u l d be used 
f o r SME on-lending, and the bank’s capital strengthening, among others. 

73. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (M IGA ) Costa R ica became a 
member o f MIGA in February 1994. The outstanding po r t fo l io in Costa R ica consists o f 
15 contracts o f guarantee, o f wh ich 11 are in the tou r ism sector, tw o in the infrastructure 
and tw o in the manufacturing sectors, with a to ta l gross exposure o f US$152.4 m i l l i o n 
and net exposure o f US$128.3 m i l l i o n . During FY03 , one p ro jec t totaling US$81 m i l l i o n 
in the tourism sector was executed in Costa Rica. MIGA has no t had any technical 
assistance engagements in Costa R ica in recent years, however, MIGA’s on - l ine

CPS Annex B l a 
Costa Rica CAS Completion Rev iew 1993-2003’ 

1. 

This completion review undertakes an assessment o f the relationship be tween 
Costa R ica and the Bank in the 1993-2003 period. I t assesses the outcome o f the last 
CAS, approved by the Boa rd o n M a r c h 20, 1993 and covering the pe r iod 1993-97, as 
we l l as more recent cooperation over the pe r iod leading to t h e present CPS. The review 
draws heavily on the Operations Evaluation Department’s 
last Country Assistance 
Eva lua t ion (CAE) wh ich was prepared in late 2000 and covers the Bank’s assistance 
strategy in Costa R ica in the 1990s. 

A. 

The Country Context 

2. 

Costa Rica i s one o f the most stable democracies in L a t i n America, with a long 
standing commitment t o inclusive economic growth, social welfare and the environment. 
I t s economic and social indicators show be t te r results than those in a l l other lower- 
middle-income L a t i n American countries. Historically, however, t h e pace o f re fo rm has 
been slow and driven by a highly democratic process o f achieving consensus. G row th and 
the absence o f m i l i ta ry expenditures allowed the Government t o devote a h i g h share o f 
pub l ic h d s to social programs and environmental concerns, however high domestic 
debt and serious financial imbalances in the 90s led t o the questioning o f the long t e r m 
v iab i l i ty o f the Costa R ican model. 

3 . 

A f te r a strong decline in coffee prices in 1978 and the o i l crisis in 1979, Costa 
Rica did not adjust public expenditures accordingly and the Government suspended 
servicing i t s external debt. T o deal with the crisis, the Government in i t ia ted in 1982-83 a 
stabilization program supported by t h e IMF and a structural adjustment program 
supported by t h e Bank and IADB. The m a i n objective o f the re fo rm program was to 
overcome tw o severe impediments to growth: the anti-export bias o f the trade regime and 
an overextended and inefficient pub l ic sector. The structural reforms during the period 
1984-93 were aimed at l ibe ra l iz ing international trade and reducing the ro le o f the state in 
productive activities, reducing effective protection, increasing incentives t o exporters, 
and imp rov ing the efficiency o f pub l ic sector institutions. The Government was 
committed to reducing export taxes, maintaining a competitive exchange rate and 
decreasing the l e v e l and dispersion o f impo r t taxes. 

4 . 

During the pe r iod 1994-99 the Government’s program gave p r io r i ty t o re-defining 
the role o f the state and imp rov ing t h e efficiency o f private markets, wh i le continuing to 
provide fo r poverty alleviation and environment’s protection. President Figueres (1 994- 
98 ) was able t o continue the trade l ibe ra l iza t ion program, imp rove fiscal discipline and 
managed to attract a significant volume o f foreign direct investment in high-tech 
indus tr ies . The Government o f President Rodriguez (1998-2002) gave high p r io r i ty to the 
financial sector re fo rm and t o open pub l ic enterprises t o competition with the private 
sector. Specifically, important areas fo r re fo rm included changes t o the banking and

social security systems and to the regulatory framework t o a l low p r iva te participation in 
pub l ic u t i l i t ies and natural monopolies controlled by the state. 

B. 

Evaluation o f the Country Assistance Strategy 1993-1997 

5 . 

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 93) was presen ted t o the Boa rd o n M a r c h 
10, 1993 in conjunction w i t h a proposal fo r a T h u d Structural Adjustment Loan ( S A L , 
111), wh ich was to be the last quick disbursement lend ing operation fo r Costa Rica. The 
strategy also proposed to focus o n a relatively small investment program based upon the 
Bank's perceived comparative advantage at t h e time. The overall program was contingent 
o n t h e Government maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic framework and o n 
successhl implementation o f the structural adjustment program. The re fo rm program, 
supported by the FY93 CAS, included fou r pillars: (i) pub l ic sector reform, (ii) social 
sectors and poverty alleviation, (iii) trade and regulatory framework and (iv) 
financial 
sector re fo rm aimed at reducing the country's vulnerability to external shocks and the 
recurrence o f macroeconomic disequilibria prompted by inappropriate fiscal policies 
equitable society. 

6. 

The proposed lending program also included six sector investment loans in water 
and sanitation, health, forestry and bio-diversity, transport, education and urban. The 
economic and sector w o r k (ESW) program was expected t o produce a Country Economic 
Memorandum t o focus o n pub l ic sector reform. An ongoing forestry sector review wou ld 
support an operation t o imp rove forestry and b io -d ive rs i ty management. An urban sector 
study wou ld help define policies t o be included under a proposed u rban project. Finally, a 
Poverty Assessment study w o u l d review progress in poverty alleviation and seek 
improvements in targeted interventions and the poverty orientation o f social spending. 

7 . 

The outcome o f CAS 93 was unsatisfactory. The adjustment loan straddled two 
administrations, and was cancelled after tw o years fo l low ing mu tua l agreement that the 
tranche release conditions were un l ike ly to be met. None o f the other sector investment 
lending, and on ly part o f the planned economic and sector work, was delivered during the 
1993-1997 period covered by the CAS. 
Indeed, fo l low ing the cancellation o f the 
adjustment operation, the government exp l ic i t ly requested the Bank t o reduce lending and 
t o increase technical advice. 

8. 

OED be l ieves that the authorities were uninterested in Bank lending because o f 
the i r perception that i t wou ld be d i f f icu l t t o reach agreement with the Bank o n the 
p o l i t i c a l feas ib i l i ty and a realistic schedule o f po l icy and institutional reforms. The C A E 
concluded that the 1993-97 CAS was based o n a correct diagnosis o f Costa Rica's long 
t e r m development problems and included h i g h l y relevant objectives. However, i t 
included inappropriate lending instruments, overlooked lessons o f experience and ignored 
po l i t ica l realities o n the feasibility and timing o f some o f the specific measures required. 
Consequently, the Bank was unable t o deliver i t s lending program and the po l icy 
dialogue deteriorated. The C A E notes: 

2 

The CAS included inapp rop r ia te lending instruments and p o o r l y designed reform 
p rog rams , in spite of ava i lab le lessons of experience. The adjustment operation 
was no t appropriate to pursue the proposed objectives since i t included 
comprehensive institutional reforms in the public, financial and social sectors 
wh ich required Congress approval o f legislation as conditions 
fo r 
loan 
effectiveness. The lessons o f experience show that Costa R ica has been a steady, 
but slow, reformer, w i t h a l o n g process o f internal debate and consensus building 
before major reforms are approved by Congress. Howeve r S A L 111 included the 
passage o f legislation as a condition fo r 
loan effectiveness. Consequently, the 
Bank had to extend the deadline fo r t h e loan effectiveness six t imes wh i le wa i t ing 
f o r the authorities t o achieve the required passage o f legislation by Congress, and 
u l t ima te ly the loan was cancelled. 
The CAS ignored p o l i t i c a l conditions. The Bank assistance strategy was 
undermined by a poor appreciation o f the po l i t ica l conditions determining 
ownership o f the re fo rm program. The Project Completion No te o f S A L . I11 
concluded that the loan was terminated because the program was designed, 
negotiated and signed by one Administration while i t s implementation was l e f t to 
a new Administration that had a markedly different approach to the issues 
involved. 

9. 
Fo l low ing the cancellation o f the S A L , the Bank supported t h e objectives o f the 
strategy ma in ly through supervision o f the small po r t fo l io o f projects already under 
implementation. According to the Bank’s internal performance indicators, Costa R ica 
has achieved satisfactory development outcomes in implementing the Bank-supported 
po r t fo l io . The po r t fo l io (total commitments o f US$310 m i l l ion ) evaluated by the Bank 
during 1994-99 achieved satisfactory development outcomes. The evaluation includes 
three projects subjected to independent evaluation by OED and four ongoing projects 
evaluated by the region, no t yet subjected t o independent evaluation, wh ich the Bank 
rated as satisfactory. I t i s noteworthy that over l o n g evaluation periods, the overall 
po r t fo l io o f the Bank in Costa R ica has generally achieved be t te r resu l ts than in most 
other clients. Ove r 1970-1999, about 87 percent o f Costa Rica’s po r t fo l io achieved 
satisfactory development outcomes, wh ich i s much higher than the 70 per cent or the 74 
per cent satisfactory rating achieved in the same period by LCR o r by the Bank, 
respectively. 

10. During the 1993- 1997 period, t h e Bank fa i led t o complete a Country Economic 
Memorandum that was needed t o de f ine the p o l i c y agenda fo r discussions with the 
Government o f President Figueres in 1994 and failed t o produce an urban sector study 
intended t o de f ine policies t o be included under a proposed urban project. However, i t 
did prepare an update o f a poverty study (FY97) t o identify the needs o f the poo r and an 
influential study proposing a pension re fo rm strategy.

In the social sectors more generally, since 1999 the Bank and Government have 
pursued j o i n t sector diagnosis and fo l lowed up with dialogue and technical support. Key 
issues include improving equity and effectiveness in education, and imp rov ing the 
targeting o f social assistance programs. Progress has been gradual but sustained, based 
o n diagnostic wo rk wh ich creates awareness o f issues and then fosters consensus about 
next steps. The Bank has maintained dialogue and presence by engaging with key people 
in the sectors (health, education, social protection) and the social cabinet, and by carrying 
out the diagnostichector analysis w h i c h later became the Social Spending and Poverty 
Report. Perhaps the most important outcome has been the identification o f areas fo r 
improvement in education, such as efficiency and equity in ru ra l schools and steady 
improvement in institutional effectiveness. This w o r k i s now being incorporated in to the 
planned F Y 0 4 Education Project. 

15 . 

In the environmental sector, the forestry sector rev iew was one o f the f i r s t 
attempts worldwide t o value the ind iv idua l components o f the forest, including the 
biodiversity, carbon captured, w o o d and other values, and i t greatly 
influenced 
Government’s intervention in the sector. The w o r k l e d t o one o f the f i r s t environmental 
service payment schemes in the world, wh ich i s n ow being emulated around the globe. 
This program i s being supported by the Bank in the innovative Ecomarkets project, and a 
second project has now been requested by Government to make the sector financially 
self-sufficient. In addition, in ag r icu l tu re , although a planned agricultural sector re fo rm 
project never became effective, the preparatory analysis and p o l i c y dialogue also 
influenced the sector considerably - fo r example, Government retired f r om grain 
marketing, and implemented market based reforms in technology and other reforms. 
Finally, in the areas o f indigenous peoples and gender, the Bank supported Government 
efforts through IDFs, wh ich (although they weren’t implemented in full) helped define 
po l icy for indigenous peoples, inc lud ing the development o f a national indigenous p ro f i le 
and a development plan, and helped mainstream gender analysis in to most o f the 

m i n i s t r i e s .

O v e r a l l Conclusion and Lessons f o r the n ew CPS 

16. 
Throughout the past decade, Costa R ica continued t o implement reforms at i t s 
o w n pace, with financial assistance f r om other donors, domestic bo r row ing and, lately, by 
se l l ing bonds in the international capital market. W h i l e reforms have been slow, Costa 
R ica has achieved be t te r social and economic results than similar countries in L a t i n 
America, and i t s po l i t ica l and social stability has been extremely attractive t o investors 
and tourists alike. Du r ing and beyond the CAS period, Costa R ica advanced 
significantly toward many o f the objectives proposed under the CAS 93, in sp i te o f 
m in ima l financial support f rom the Bank. K e y areas include: 

Progress i n implementing s t ruc tu ra l reforms. Costa R x a has continuously made 
progress in opening-up 
trade, diversifying exports and implementing 
the 
recommendations o f the f inanc ia l sector assessment, while maintaining po l i t ica l 
stability and attracting high-tech foreign investment. 

5 

P rog ress i n imp lemen t ing soc ia l a n d env i ronmen ta l reforms. The authorities have 
also undertaken measures to improve the efficiency, targeting and leve l o f social 
expenditures, 
inc lud ing rationalization o f government agencies and closer 
cooperation w i t h private providers o f social services. Environmental policies 
have been strengthened with t h e passage o f the Environment L a w in 1996 and the 
implementation o f a strategic plan. 
Progress i n gende r po l ic ies . Costa R ica has been a pioneer in incorporating 
women in the process o f development. A f te r the approval o f t h e L a w to Promote 
the Social Equality o f Women in t h e early 1990s, Costa R ica reached the forefront 
in sponsoring women’s rights with legislation comparable t o the legislation o f 
many developed countries. 
P rog ress i n fo res t ry p o l i c i e s . Costa R ica i s considered a pioneer in reforestation, 
forest management and forest protection policies. 

17. 
Although the Bank gave v e r y l i t t l e financial assistance t o Costa R ica over the last 
decade, f r om t h e late n i n e t i e s the Bank made significant efforts t o improve the po l icy 
dialogue by p rov id ing technical advice, mostly financed through grant facilities, and 
responding qu ick ly b many formal and in fo rma l requests fo r analysis and advice made 
by the authorities. The Bank’s non-lending assistance became an important source o f 
advice to the Government on the design and implementation o f reforms, and the ‘Bank 
se rved as a catalyst in promoting discussion and consensus-building in key po l icy areas. 
T h e key to the effectiveness o f these efforts has been to iden t i fy and support areas where 
there i s internal consensus about issues and d i rec t ion fo r reform, and t o provide 
diagnostic and technical advice on demand . 

18. Give the lessons f r om the Bank’s relationship w i t h Costa R ica over the last 
decade, the future CPS should be highly selective and to ta l ly demand-driven, i.e. in areas 
where the Costa Ricans specifically reques t Bank assistance because there i s internal 
consensus about the need fo r and overall direction f o r reform, and they believe that the 
Bank’s global experience can add value to the diagnosis, dialogue and implementation o f 
reforms. Furthermore, given t h e i r ve ry tight 
fiscal situation, 
the Government has 
indicated that i t i s p r ima r i ly interested in bo r row ing fo r projects that “pay fo r themselves” 
through efficiency gains leading t o cost-savings o r through revenue generation f rom 
enhanced cost-recovery f r om say t a r i f f increases. The Bank in turn has considerable 
in te res t in being engaged in areas where the lessons f r om Costa Rica’s successful poverty 
reduction and economic diversification efforts and pioneering 
leadership 
in 
environmental management wou ld be instructive f o r other B a n k clients. Overall, 
therefore, the country partnership strategy should focus more o n knowledge sharing and 
advisory services and less o n resource transfer objectives, and should continue t o 
promote reforms by supporting 
the po l icy dialogue through n o n lending services, 
inc lud ing well-focused and properly disseminated ES W, technical assistance and grants. 
M o r e project-specific lessons include: 

Where an appropriate po l icy and institutional environment i s needed fo r projects 
to yield expected benefits, the Bank should ensure that the proper environment i s 
in place before the project i s approved, no t as cond i t ion f o r effectiveness. In 

6 

particular, lending to support structural reforms should be considered on ly i f the 
required legislation i s approved before lending i s committed. 
Given Costa Rica's institutional environment, w ide social support i s needed t o get 
Na t iona l Assembly approval and t o implement reforms, hence conditions agreed 
with the Executive related to key reforms should be strictly under control o f the 
Executive and no t dependent upon Congress approval.

Execu t ive S umm a r y o f Cos ta R i c a 
Soc ia l Spend ing and the Poo r 

Good progress, but a worrying slowdown in poverty reduction- 

1. 
Cos ta R i c a made subs tan t ia l progress in r e d u c i n g headcoun t pove r ty and 
im p r o v i n g soc ia l sector ind ica to rs ove r the 1990s. D r i v e n by econom ic g r o w t h averag ing 
4.5 percen t o f GDP , and s t rong inves tmen t in the soc ia l sectors, the p r o p o r t i o n o f peop le 
b e l ow the p o v e r t y l i n e dec l ined f r om 27 pe rcen t in 1990 t o 2 1 pe rcen t in 2000 and the 
p r o p o r t i o n o f ex t reme ly p o o r households d ropped f r o m 10 pe rcen t t o 6 percent- 
a l though the pace o f reduc t ion in pove r ty s lowed d o w n during the second h a l f o f the 
n ine t ies . W h i l e coverage o f educa t ion and hea l th rema ins nea r ly un ive rsa l in the case o f 
bas ic educa t ion and access t o healthcare services, there are w o r r y i n g signs tha t soc ia l 
sector ind ica to rs and the e f f ic iency and e f fec t iveness o f soc ia l spend ing has begun t o 
p la teau o r dec l ine in some cases. Be tween 1990 and 2000, Cos ta R i c a f e l l f r o m 2 8 t h t o 
4 8 t h in the I n d e x o f H um a n Deve lopmen t . In education, there has been increase in gross 
secondary en ro l lmen t t o 62.1 percen t , but there were a lso increases in repe t i t ion rates. 
Ac ross the board, educa t ion leve ls are worse f o r those in the l o w e r income qu in t i les . In 
health, pe r fo rmance con t inues t o imp rove in te rms o f l i f e expec tancy in fan t mo r ta l i ty , 
and hea l th systems per formance , but there i s inc reas ing d issa t is fac t ion with the sys tem as

diseases are tu rned away . Howeve r , there i s n o consensus as t o whe the r o r . n o t this 
s i tua t ion represents s tagna t ion in soc ia l cond i t ions . F o r example, w h i l e l i t t l e progress was 
made in reduc ing pove r ty be tween 1995 and 1999, during this p e r i o d soc ia l ind ica to rs 
tha t are n o rm a l l y associated with be t ter l iv ing conditions-such 
as reductions, in in fan t 
m o r t a l i t y and imp rovemen ts in l i f e expectancy-have 
shown imp rovemen ts . 

-despite real increases in social services expenditures- 
2. 

O v e r the las t ten years, p u b l i c spend ing g rew seven ty pe rcen t in rea l t e rm s , and 
the share o f p u b l i c spending a l loca ted t o the soc ia l sectors increased f r o m 59 percen t t o 
63 percent, with spending in educa t ion and pens ions g r o w i n g m o r e r a p i d l y than spend ing 
in hea l th and soc ia l p ro tec t ion . Cos ta R i c a spends m o r e r e l a t i v e t o GDP, and as a share o f 
p u b l i c expenditures, o n soc ia l services ove ra l l than o ther coun t r ies in L a t i n Amer ica , and 
cons iderab ly mo re than the average f o r o the r coun t r ies a t s im i l a r stages o f deve lopmen t 
ou ts ide the reg ion . The l e v e l o f spending, and the un ive rsa l focus o f many o f these 
programs , mask the t rue e f fec t iveness o f these programs-in 
te rms o f reach ing the poo r 
and vu lne rab le groups l iv ing in r u r a l areas and c i t y slums. Desp i te recen t g r ow t h in the 
economy , m a n y o f the p o o r and vu lne rab le d o n o t have access t o soc ia l programs, w h i c h

3. 

Cu r ren t mac roeconom ic c ircums tances d o n o t seem l i k e l y t o p r o v i d e Cos ta R i c a

soc ia l spending. This underscores a k e y finding o f this repo r t : tha t the soc ia l sector 
cha l lenges w i l l n o t be reso lved o n l y by a l loca t ing m o r e resources, they w i l l requ i re 
unde r tak ing re fo rms t o imp rove managemen t and e f f ic iency in the use o f ava i lab le

approaches w i l l be requ i red tha t focus o n ob ta in ing va lue f o r money in the soc ia l 
programs . 

-raising three key questions- 
4. 

There are three k e y questions w h i c h f rame o u r ana lys is . First: w h o are the p o o r 
and vu lne rab le g roups in Costa Rica-and w h a t are t h e i r m o s t impo r tan t needs? The 
repo r t addresses this by p r o v i d i n g an in-depth, mu l t i -d imens iona l ana lys is o f pove r ty . 
Second: wha t has been the impac t o f soc ia l spend ing o n the we l fa re f o r the poor- h o w 
are the needs o f the p o o r being m e t by existing p rog rams? W e answer this by exam in ing 
the e f fec t iveness o f governmen t po l ic ies and spend ing o n the p o o r in the soc ia l sectors. 
Desp i te a gene ra l ly good t rack record, there are s t i l l some k e y areas in w h i c h the needs o f 
the p o o r are n o t b e i n g adequately addressed. F ina l ly , g i v e n these p r o b l em areas, we ask: 
h o w can gove rnmen t spending be used mo re e f f e c t i v e l y t o reach the poor , imp rove soc ia l 
ind ica to rs and con t r ibu te t o reduc ing headcoun t pove r ty? T h e repo r t p rov ides b o t h sector- 
spec i f ic and genera l p o l i c y op t ions . A c omm o n theme 
in the sector spec i f ic 
recommenda t ions i s the need f o r greater f l e x i b i l i t y in the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
ex is t ing programs , coup led with m o r e e f f i c i e n t adm in is t ra t ion . M o r e generally, w e 
advocate the c rea t ion o f a p o l i c y -m a k i n g mechan ism , cha rged with setting soc ia l po l icy , 
e x p l o i t i n g synergies, and reduc ing p rog ram ove r lap . 

-which suggest that structural reforms are needed, not increased funding- 
5. 

The past decade has demons tra ted tha t s ign i f ican t imp rovemen ts are poss ib le in 
the soc ioeconom ic c o n d i t i o n o f the p o o r w h e n econom ic g r o w t h i s comb ined with cos t-

we l fa re improvemen ts . Howeve r , progress in p o v e r t y reduc t ion and soc ia l sector 
pe r fo rmance has been uneven, and there are im p o r t a n t gaps be tween r i c h and poo r . 
Con t inued imp rovemen ts w i l l have t o r e l y o n be t te r use o f the ava i lab le resources. I f the

Costa R i c a Pub l ic D e b t Managemen t and 
Domest ic D e b t M a r k e t Deve lopmen t Assessment R e p o r t 

Summary 

Costa Rica’s pub l ic debt has significant exposure due to i t s re la t ive ly high leve l (over 
50% o f debt-to-GDP) and i t s vulnerabilities 
to exchange rate, interest rate and 
refinancing risk. T h e Costa R ican authorities are aware o f these r i s k s and wish t o better 
manage them, wh ich includes a M e r
 development o f the domestic debt market. T h e 
authorities have reques ted participation in the Bank’s Program o f C o u n t r y Assessment 
a n d Reform P l a n in D e b t Managemen t a n d Domes t ic D e b t M a r k e t Deve lopmen t , and 
have already hosted the Assessment mission. The corresponding Assessment Report i s 
the base fo r discussion o f the re fo rm p lan design, a stage wh ich i s being initiated with the 
full support and active participation o f the authorities. However, as developing capacity 
in debt management and debt markets i s a lengthy process, t h e Bank w i l l also help the 
country develop appropriate forms o f continued assistance beyond the scope o f the 
Program. 

I. 

Background 

Public debt management and domestic debt market development in Costa R ica should be 
evaluated within a context o f macroeconomic vulnerability. W h i l e w ide ly considered to 
have the most stable po l i t ica l environment and highest social indicators in i t s region, 
Costa R ica has su f fe red recently in terms o f lowe r economic growth, and significant 
pub l ic sector and current account deficits. 

With a re la t ive ly high debt-to-GDP ra t io (over 50%), debt sustainability i s becoming an 
issue, according to a recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA) made by the Banco Central 
de Costa R ica (BCCR). The government’s continued ab i l i ty to service i t s debt i s 
considered vulnerable t o external shocks, even moderate, that cou ld diminish economic 
g row th rates, cause a real currency devaluation o r lead t o an increase in rea l interest rates. 

The government has made i t a key p r io r i ty t o pass fiscal measures that w o u l d address 
growing imbalances, but the r i s k i n e s s o f 
the debt structure i t s e l f cou ld cause the 
necessary fiscal adjustment t o be much larger should these r i s k s materialize. Costa Rica’s 
pub l ic debt - o f wh ich almost 70% corresponds t o the central government- i s potentially 
r i s k y no t on ly because o f i t s re la t ive ly high level, but also because i t s structure i s exposed 
to exchange rate, in te res t rate and refinancing r i s k . 

Currently, close to 45% o f central government (CG) debt has exposure t o currency r i s k , 
30% has exposure t o f loa t ing interest rates, and refinancing r i s k fo r the next year i s fa i r ly 
significant, with 23% o f debt coming due; in particular, the central government’s 
domestic debt has significant refinancing r i s k , as 32% matures in less than 1 year and an 

’ Source o f data i s detailed in Costa R i c a Country Assessment Report 

additional 29% has maturities between 1 and 5 years. These exposures cou ld result in 
significant increases in the budget’s debt servicing load. 

As fo r BCCR debt, although almost 80% o f i t i s domestic, 63% o f to ta l debt i s exposed to 
currency risk largely because more than h a l f o f i ts domestic debt i s issued in t i m e 
deposits in U S dollars (CERTD$). Du ra t ion i s re la t ive ly short (0.5 years). Financial 
losses materializing f rom BCCR debt (i.e., 
the quasi fiscal deficit) wou ld eventually be 
covered by the central government, so ultimately the latter bears the risk o f the pub l ic 
debt po r t fo l io . 

These financial r i s k s could be better managed with sound pub l ic debt management 
practices and successful development o f the domestic debt market. The Costa R ican 
authorities are w e l l aware o f the vulnerabilities associated with their country’s pub l ic 
debt, and have indicated their des i re to move to a more technical and efficient 
management o f these r i s k s . As a resu l t , they requested that their country be included n 
the j o i n t W o r l d Bank - IMF Program o f Country Assessment and Re fo rm Plan in Public 
Debt Management and Domestic Debt Ma rke t Development. 
This program was 
developed as a fo l low -up to the best practice guidelines o n pub l ic debt management and 
domestic debt market development*. 

The Program’s m a i n objective i s t o design a set o f reforms and capacity building 
initiatives, based on a diagnostic, t o imp rove a country’s capacity in sovereign debt 
management and in t h e development and maintenance o f the domestic debt market. A 
second objective i s the p rov is ion o f an important demonstration project that can show 
h ow principles fo r sound public debt management and the h n c t i o n o f debt markets can 
be translated in to practical re fo rm programs. 

This b r i e f annex summarizes a more detailed j o i n t Bank - IMF Country Debt management 
and Debt Market Development Assessment report. 
Developing capacity in debt 
management and in developing loca l debt markets i s a lengthy process. Hence, t h e 
remaining sections summarize the m a i n findings o f this wo rk with the important proviso 
that this w i l l be a continuing process. 

II. Key issues 

Public debt management 

In recent years the Costa %can authorities have made important progress in modernizing 
public debt management, including: the merging within the M in is te r io de Hacienda (MH) 
o f Credit0 Publico in to the Tesoreria t o create one consolidated debt management o f f ice 
w i t h a front, m idd le and back o f f ice structure; t h e creation o f an Asset and L i a b i l i t y 

“Guidelines for Public Debt Management”, IMF and The World Bank, 2001. 
Following the request by the Government to participate i n the Program, a joint World Bank-IMF mission visited San 
Jose in July 2003, and left i n the f ie ld an Aide Memoire summarizing the main findings. Subsequently, a more detailed 
Country Assessment report was produced and provided to the authorities for their review. A Memorandum o f 
Understanding i s being discussed to confirm the authorities’ interest i n pursuing the second phase, i.e. design o f the 
reform plan.

Management Department in the central bank, also with a front, middle and back office 
structure; progress in developing the domestic debt market, particularly at the short end 
o f the yield curve and promotion o f t h e creation o f a standardized regional debt market; 
and w o r k o n analysis o f the debt’s costs and r i s k s , and with th is , p re l im ina ry proposals 
for a debt management strategy, both by MJ3 and BCCR. 

However, public debt management i s compartmentalized in different instiQtions : MH 
issues debt to meet central government funding requirements, wh i le BCCR issues debt 
fo r open market operations (OMOs) and fo r hnding i t s ow n quasi-fiscal deficit4. As a 
resu l t , the debt issuance objectives o f the two entities are to a degree uncoordinated and 
at t im e s even conflicting, resulting in the lack o f an 
integrated strategy fo r managing the 
aggregate public sector debt po r t fo l io and i t s r i s k implications fo r the government’s 
balance sheet, and fo r developing the domestic debt markets. 

A lso missing i s a more fo rma l set o f responsibilities fo r the authorities invo lved in debt 
management, as fo r example, exp l ic i t strategic objectives related to managing the cost- 
risk t rade -o f f inheren t in debt portfolios, a fo rma l decision making apparatus that 
coordinates the tw o entities, periodic reports t o top policy-makers w i t h strategic 
recommendations fo r managing the debt and developing the domestic debt market, and in 
turn, reports to Congress o n strategy choice and implementation. 

This may be 
related 
to 
the 
institutional 
fragmentation o f debt management 
responsibilities; there are many advantages t o hav ing these responsibilities consolidated 
in one entity, which in many countries tends t o be the Ministry o f Finance. In the case o f 
Costa Rica, such a proposal w o u l d requ i re a fiu-ther strengthening o f the institutional 
capacity o f the Tesoreria in MH, in order that it take o n the debt management 
responsibilities currently be ing carried out by BCCR . Such a project wou ld include 
strengthening t h e areas o f staffing, training and information technology. 

Until this transference i s completed, bw e v e r , greater coordination i s required between 
Tesoreria and BCCR in order t o develop an integrated strategy fo r managing t h e cost and 
r i s k o f debt and fo r developing t h e domestic debt market. A top po l i t ica l commitment and 
leadership are required, as there i s a tendency fo r each institution t o focus o n the i r ow n 
more na r row ly defmed objectives. 

An important area o f w o r k w o u l d be the development o f cash-flow mode l fo r 
quantifying debt-servicing r i s k fo r a l l BCCR and MH debt, w h c h wou ld feed in to the 
development o f an integrated debt management strategy, w i t h reference t o risk and cost 
trade-offs and development o f t h e domestic debt market. 

Eventually debt management should be removed f rom BCCR’s functions b y recapitalizaing the latter, or through 
transfer o f annual quasi-fiscal de f ic i t onto govemment’s budget.

M o n e t a r y po l icy and debt management I domestic deb t m a r k e t in te r face 

The re i s also progress and remaining issues fo r the interface be tween monetary po l icy 
and debt management. O n the one hand, progress has been made with the introduction o f 
competitive j o i n t auctions fo r central government and central bank securities and w i t h the 
standardization o f new issues t o improve their liquidity and marketability. There are 
however, remaining issues : 
. g row ing fiscal deficits together w i t h heavy quasi-fiscal losses and a negative capital 
position o f the BCCR are obstructing the conduct o f monetary policy; 
. the need to strengthen BCCR balance sheet by restoring positive capital and 
eliminating operating losses; concomitantly, 
the absence o f assets with wh ich to 
undertake repurchase agreements and remove liquidity has induced the BCCR to use 
. the increased do l la r iza t ion trend, high l e v e l o f desintermediation (off-balance sheet 
auctions o f p r ima ry securities as the principal ins t rumen t o f OMOs; 
operations) and interest rates vo la t i l i ty o n assets denominated in domestic currency 
reduce the scope o f monetary policy, thus aggravating the complexity o f monetary 
programming and t h e short term implementation o f liquidity management; 
. the introduction o f an explicit Lomba rd fac i l i ty -at a preannounce interest rate- wou ld 
no t on ly se rve as a proper signal f o r monetary policy, but w o u l d also p rov ide necessary 
liquidity. The latter, together w i t h a concomitant deposit fac i l i ty t o absorb liquidity, 
wou ld help develop a co r r ido r t o smooth in te res t rate fluctuations; 
. sound monetary po l icy should be complemented with an appropriate cash 
management po l icy t o improve the overall liquidity management and to develop the 
money market. Nevertheless, there seems to be an inadequate in fo rma t ion base and 
capacity fo r assessing, projecting and updating short-term liquidity, thereby making cash 
f lows uncertain and volatile. 

Many o f these issues highlight the need to re-capitalize the BCCR, as also recommended 
in the Financial Sector Assessment.’ The authorities are committed to such a process and 
are w e l l aware o f t h e problems that are arising fo r debt management, debt market 
development, and implementation o f monetary policy. 

Domestic debt m a r k e t deve lopment 

Overall Costa Rica’s debt market development i s limited by structural features o f the 
market that include t h e prominence o f pub l ic sector as a key demander o f such securities, 
a l im i ted t r u e private investor base, and limitations in the basic infrastructure fo r custody 
clearing and settlement o f government securities. 
In addition, development i s also 
hindered by important institutional limitations, the most prominent o f wh ich i s the lack o f 
an exp l ic i t w r i t ten debt issuance strategy agreed upon by MH and BCCR. 

D e b t Issuance S t ra tegy : As mentioned, Costa Rica’s domestic debt market development 
i s hindered by the lack o f an explicit, w r i t ten debt issuance strategy between MH and 
BCCR. Wh i le improvements in coordination have been made fo r sub-one year issuance, 

Costa Rica FSAP 

4 

the tendency to be reactive and sometimes arbitrary in t e r m s o f the auction calendar, 
security choice and characteristics, and issuance quantities, has damaged the c red ib i l i ty 
o f the authorities. A reduction in t h i s uncertainty wou ld likely lead t o a lowe r ing o f the 
government’s financing costs. 
In addition, imp rov ing the systems fo r forecasting and 
accounting in the case o f MH’s cash needs and BCCR’s liquidity needs wou ld help se t 
the stage fo r a better auction process. 

The concentration in the distribution channels, and the unique ro le o f the Puestos in t h e 
auctioning process fo r public debt has negative implications fo r transparency and 
competition in the market. Bm p e t i t i o n issues are &her 
clouded as the Puestos o f ten 
f o rm part o f larger financial conglomerates, and have an intrinsic relationship t o the 
pub l ic institutions. Other methods o f government security distribution should be 
investigated, w i t h the caveat that t h e structure o f the financial system at large in t e rm s o f 
financial conglomerates may limit the options. 

M a r k e t S t ruc tu re Cons iderat ions: T h e c w e n t high paced growth o f assets managed by 

mu tua l funds along w i t h specific features o f CR’s securities markets can place the 
financial system at r i s k should the market suffer any type o f price shock. T h e high 
concentration in the po r t fo l io composition (in government securities), f lawed capital and 
liquidity requirements, along with a valuation methodology wh ich relies o n marking to 
mode l in an illiquid market exacerbates systemic risk. Mu tua l funds w i t h longer term and 
re la t ive ly illiquid assets are susceptible to a v ic ious cycle where sudden redemptions 
cause fund managers t o s e l l assets quickly, w h i c h in an illiquid market causes large drops 
in asset prices and correspondingly large drops in po r t fo l io valuation. This in turn fuels 
&her 
redemptions. Furthermore, since the largest o f mu tua l hnds are also part o f state- 
owned financial conglomerates, the fmancial system at large can be pu l led in to such a 
crisis. 
In order to avo id such an occurrence, the supervisory bodies should study 
alternatives to the current capital requirements and mon i to r liquidity mismatches more 
closely. This should include the development o f a reporting framework that w i l l enable 
such monitoring.6 

The Superintendencia de Valores should consider implementing &her 
incentives, 
inc lud ing a redefinition o f t h e “liquidity coefficient”, 
fo r the Fondos de Inversi6n t o 
p rope r ly insure against such r i s k s . The coefficient, used to calculate the amount o f 
liquidity the funds must maintain, does a poor, one-dimensional j o b at measuring 
potential r isk , as i t does no t analyze the underlying nature o f t h e fund portfolios, and i s 
backward looking. The amount o f liquidity t h e fund must maintain should be inversely 
proportional to the liquidity o f the assets i t holds, and should consider the r i s k i n e s s o f the 
assets as well, at a minimum. The liquidity requirements should consider the w e r a l l 
poss ib i l i ty o f illiquidity o f the market as a whole, in addition t o the d i f f icu l ty in asset 
valuation. 

The significant negative duration gap in obligatory pension funds makes them a natural 
buyer o f long t e r m colon denominated issues, and a natural participant in the 

Several other La t in American countries are more c a r e h l l y addressing this problem (e.g. Mexico, Colombia, and 
Brazil. 

5 

government’s intention to establish a longer dated yield curve in colones. Currently, the 
pension fund’s appetite to match duration i s hindered by the existing mark to market 
requirement fo r their long dated government securities. Since the longer dated securities 
tend t o be more illiquid, their mark-to-market value tends t o su f fe r more volatility. A 
more careful study o f the l iab i l i ty structure wou ld help the government understand the 
t y p e s o f ins trumen ts these pension funds wou ld most naturally requ i re t o ameliorate their 
risk structure. 

As i s typical in many developing markets, the secondary market in C R i s illiquid, 
dominated by government securities and with trading concentrated in the short end o f the 
curve. There have been too many issue rs o f pub l ic debt with d i f fe ren t characteristics., 
although in recent years the fragmentation has been somewhat reduced, v ia actions t o 
undertake more effective fiscal planning and v i a more coordination in issuance processes. 
However, there are s t i l l problems in the area o f the different t y p e s o f outstanding 
securities, particularly fo r the TUDES and Tasa Basica. The outstanding issues o f Tasa 
Basica number over 20,000, with maturities ranging f r om 2003 t o 2015, with 26 different 
interest rate margins (determining coupons). With t h i s amount o f non-standardized 
issues outstanding, i t i s nearly impossible t o expect liquidity. A long with new regular 
issuance, the authorities should examine h ow to use exchange offers or debt buybacks t o 
try and reduce t h e fragmentation in instruments in the medium t o longer end o f the curve. 

Valuation o f portfolios o f government securities remains complex in Costa Rica except in 
the very short end o f the curve, due t o illiquidity and t h e various structural problems 
mentioned elsewhere. Current methods o f ma rk ing to mode l and interpolation cannot 
substitute fo r the fbrther development o f a loca l colones curve w i t h sufficiently liquid 
benchmarks. In part, this i s explained by lack o f sufficient standardization o f long dated 
co lon denominated debt. However, fkrther rev iew o f the methods n ow deployed by the 
Bolsa fo r determining the vector o f prices, in light o f bo th international experience and o f 
t h e trading system design, i s in order. 

Market Infrastructure: T h e infrastructure fo r clearing, custody and settlement o f 
securities in the secondary market in Costa R ica has fragmented liquidity until recently. 
In large part the specific requ iremen ts associated with the “locking in o f collateral” 
within t h r e e different trading reg imes (the Bolsa, the MIB, and the Mercado de Liquidez 
fo r Puestos only) have resulted in a situation o f segmented loca l markets in wh ich 
liquidity i s dispersed. In effect i t i s impossible t o free collateral locked i n t o one p la t fo rm 
to trade in another because there i s no t one true centralized depository, n o r fungibility o f 
the securities. S im i la r problems o f a lack o f interoperability and lack o f consistency o f 
the current custody arrangements with international standards also hu r t liquidity. When 
combined w i t h the non-standardization o f securities and the relative disincentives t o trade 
long dated securities (more than 180 days) due to current valuation gu ide l ines , these 
factors help to explain the lack o f liquidity in the secondary market. 

The BCCR in conjunction with other agencies i s n ow developing the new Sistema de 
Anotacion en Cuenta (SAC) that w i l l e f fec t ive ly create one centralized depository fo r a l l 
government debt. At f i r s t this entity w i l l b e operated by the BCCR but w i l l l i k e l y be 

6 

divested ( t h i s i s allowed fo r in the new LRMV) t o be managed by a special entity w i t h 
w ide ownership (investors, banks, brokers, 
the exchange etc.) and professional 
management. The new depository w i l l a l low fo r the effective linkage between the pub l ic 
debt markets traded o n the Bolsa o f OTC w i t h the inter-bank and repurchase agreement 
markets. This new system w i l l a l low fo r much greater f lex ib i l i ty in t h e t y p e s o f 
transactions that can be undertaken by a l l market participants across these markets (e.g. 
electronic negotiation o f securities based o n bilateral o r mu l t i la te ra l netting, exchange 
traded o r O TC etc.). 
I t w i l l also a l low fo r fbngibility o f securities o n deposit and i s 
essential t o support any effort to promote regional trading o f dollar denominated money 
market ins t rumen ts o r ~ e c u r i t i e s . ~ 

In going forward the authorities w i l l need to pay special attention to the r i s k s inheren t in 
implementing this more complex system especially in the area o f securities clearing and 
in l igh t o f t h e g row ing offshore trading and cross-border trading o f money market and 
debt instruments among different Central American countries that w i l l be facilitated over 
t ime . 

The attached matrix, extracted f r om the Country Assessement Report, provides a 
summa ry o f issues and recommendations, w i t h a p re l im ina ry ind ica t ion o f the i r p r io r i ty 
and pe r iod o f implementation. 

HI. Costa R ica Second Stage Projected Output: Reform Program 

The scope and t im ing o f the second stage o f the Program w i l l depend upon the Costa 
Rican authorities’ commitment and o n t h e leve l and nature o f resources needed to 
implement the re fo rm p lan and specific fo l low -up technical assistance projects. The 
output o f the second stage wou ld be the design o f a detailed program o f reforms and 
institution and capacity building in t h e areas mentioned, t o b e developed in close co- 
operation w i t h officials. The focus o f the program w i l l be practical solutions to the 
problems identified and a sequencing o f interventions. 

Based o n the experience o f other countries, a program o f this t y p e can take some t ime , 
and should be viewed as a major project, w i t h a project manager, the involvement o f key 
technical s ta f f f r om bo th institutions, and a high leve l s tee r ing committee to provide 
guidance. 

’ No te that the new system w i l l a l low for new issues o f securities to be dematerialized and registered b y the number o f 
the operation o f t h e t i t l e and w i l l allow for h g i b i l i t y . Custody accounts w i l l now be independent o f the specific front 
end trading mechanism to trade the contracts e.g., the MIB o r Bolsa. There is also the beginning o f a market in dollar 
denominated repos trading cross border among Central American countries and this w i l l be fostered if there i s a more 
modem and flexible framework for custody and settlement (liquidation) o f a l l forms o f securities contracts.

A. Overall Assessment 

The financial sector i s deep relative to other countries in the region and increasingly 
diversified. I t i s o rgan ized a round f inanc ia l g roups tha t o f t e n inc lude , in add i t ion t o an 
onshore bank, an o f fsho re b a n k , a s tock broker , a n inves tmen t fund, a n insurance 
comme rc ia l iza t ion firm, a pens ion fund, and a mo r tgage company . Gross assets o f 
f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions reached 72 percen t o f GDP in June 2 0 0 1, w h i c h i s high by L a t i n 
Ame r ican standards. W h i l e banks accoun t f o r 7 7 pe rcen t o f the f inanc ia l system assets 
and inves tmen t funds (mu tua l funds and pens ion funds) have g r o w n r a p i d l y in recen t 
years t o 10.4 percen t o f f inanc ia l sector, the cap i ta l ma rke t rema ins n a r r ow and m a i n l y 
cen tered o n p u b l i c securities. 

The public sector has an important presence in Costa Rica’s highly concentrated 
financial system, limiting competition. The onshore b a n k i n g sys tem con t inues t o be 
dom ina ted by p u b l i c banks, w h i c h inc lude three s ta te-owned comme rc ia l banks (Banco 
Nac iona l , Banco de Cos ta R ica , and Banco N a c i o n a l de Cartago), and a spec ia l-char ter 
bank (Banco Popu lar) in p r i n c i p l e ow n e d by a l l Cos ta R i c a n wo rke rs . T h e y accoun t f o r

a m o n o p o l y o f the insurance sector, th rough the I N S , and dom ina tes the pens ion and 
m u t u a l fund industry 

The banking system has become more diversified in recent years, with private banks 
continuing to gain market share. Onshore p r i v a t e banks i n c l u d e 17 banks, 10 o f w h i c h 
have at least a 5 0 percen t share o f f o r e i g n cap i ta l ( f r om the U.S. and Cen t ra l Am e r i c a n 
countries). They have expanded t h e i r share in onshore bank ing , f o l l o w i n g the

p ronounced . Pub l ic banks concentrate in c o l b n l e n d i n g t o sma l l bo r rowe rs and co lbn -

Offshore banking i s unusually large in Costa Rica. O f fsho re banks accoun t f o r abou t 
2 4 pe rcen t to ta l bank ing system assets. T h e y are l icensed in fo re ign (ma in ly Caribbean)

R i c a n res iden ts and are, therefore, fully w o v e n i n t o the coun t ry ’s domes t ic f inanc ia l and 
econom ic ac t iv i ty . The assets o f p r iva te o f fsho re banks are equ iva len t t o 4 0 percen t o f the 
assets o f p r iva te onshore banks and t o 100 pe rcen t o f the assets o f the i r co r respond ing 
onshore banks, as against 11 pe rcen t f o r p u b l i c banks. O f fsho re banks g r ew r a p i d l y in the

(ove r 2 8 percen t in 1995) and re f lec t ing p r iva te banks ’ search f o r a compe t i t ive edge

ma rke t by m u t u a l funds and p u b l i c banks. 

The already high degree o f financial dollarization i s on an increasing trend. A t 
present, 45 pe rcen t o f deposits and 50 pe rcen t o f loans o f the onshore b a n k i n g sys tem i s 
do l la r -denom ina ted . The share o f do l la r loans in the onshore l o a n p o r t f o l i o o f p r iva te 
banks is, at 60 percent, h ighe r than in p u b l i c banks (40 percent). The au tho r i t ies es t ima te 
tha t abou t h a l f o f onshore do l la r loans are t o deb tors whose incomes are n o t in do l lars ,

o n g o i n g in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l in tegra t ion , but it i s accentuated by the exchange ra te

d o l l a r deposits, w h i l e depos i t do l la r iza t ion has g r o w n desp i te a shift in in teres t ra te 
d i f fe ren t ia ls in favo r o f c o l o n depos i ts caused in pa r t by the re la t ive abundance o f l o c a l 
do l la rs . The increase in the funding cos t o f c o l o n loans, toge ther with high in te rmed ia t ion 
spreads in l o c a l cu r rency has ra ised the cos t o f c o l o n loans, induc ing d o l l a r loans t o

The intermediation spreads are high. High spreads be tween c o l b n depos i t and lending 
in teres t rates (at abou t 12 percentage po in ts , o n average) in the onshore b a n k i n g system 
p a r t l y re f lec t uneven regu la to ry and tax treatment, and ma rke t segmentation. They also 
re f lec t a c r ow d i n g ou t o f c o l b n c red i t by the p redom inan t ly co lbn -denom ina ted domes t ic 
p u b l i c debt. F ina l ly , they re f lec t the use o f cu r rency denom ina t ion as a veh ic le f o r p r ice 
d isc r im ina t ion , as c o l b n customers are gene ra l ly l e s s soph is t ica ted than do l la r customers 
and have less access t o a l te rna t ive f inanc ia l ou t lays . The no tab le d i f fe rences be tween the 
average size o f c o l b n deposits and loans c lea r ly i l lus t ra te such ma rke t segmentation. 

Banks are exposed to interest rate risk and to exchange rate risk. Banks are n o t 
d i rec t ly exposed t o in teres t ra te risk, due t o the w idespread use o f f l o a t i n g lending rates. 
Howeve r , this shifts risk t o bo r rowe rs and increases banks ’ ind i rec t exposure t o in teres t 
ra te risk by accen tua t ing the i r exposure t o c red i t risk. S im i la r ly , banks ’ d i rec t exposure t o 
the risk o f cu r rency dep rec ia t ion i s n o t s ign i f ican t , as the scope f o r h o l d i n g shor t open 
do l la r pos i t ions i s l im i t e d by regu la t ion . Howeve r , banks are ind i rec t ly exposed th rough 
the i r borrowers . Banks are aware o f the r i s k s associated with lend ing in fo re ign currency 
t o bo r rowe rs w h o d o n o t rece ive d o l l a r incomes and have taken some steps t o m i t iga te 

such risks.. 

Liquidity in the onshore banking system has been declining and i s unevenly 
distributed. Liquidity has dec l ined in recen t years as the mone ta ry au tho r i t ies reduced 
reserve requ iremen ts and banks expanded the i r lend ing opera t ions . A lso , liquidity i s 
uneven ly d is t r ibu ted across banks. While p u b l i c banks are gene ra l ly qu i te liquid, 
re f lec t ing the i r large ho ld ings o f Cos ta R i c a n gove rnmen t securities, the liquidity o f some 
p r iva te banks l ies m u c h b e l o w the average f o r the system. T h e shor t average ma tu r i ty o f 
.bank deposits (75 pe rcen t o f depos i ts have a less than th ree -mon th ma tu r i ty ) , some 
shor tcom ings o f the in te r -bank money marke t , and the l a c k o f depos i t insurance f o r 
p r iva te banks increase the risk tha t some banks m a y encoun ter in a s i tua t ion o f 
turbu lence . 

Competition between private and public commercial banks has increased, but 
significant regulatory and tax asymmetries remain. T h e p r iv i leges o f p u b l i c banks 
inc lude the state guarantee o n a l l t h e i r l i a b i l i t i e s while n o e x p l i c i t depos i t insurance ex is ts

Measures Adopted 

In response t o the recommenda t ions o f the FSA the au tho r i t ies have unde r taken re levan t

On Bank Supervision 

Joint Supervision o f Offshore Banks. During 2002 SUG E F made cons iderab le progress 

in signing Memo randa o f Unde rs tand ing (MOU) with the supe rv iso ry au tho r i t ies o f

Costa R i c a Consultations with Civil Society 

Consultation Workshop 

O n 27 January 2004, a consultation workshop, attended by about 50 representatives o f a 
broad spectrum o f Costa R ican c i v i l society organizations, was camed out to discuss the 
proposed Wo r ld Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) fo r Costa Rica. The Bank 
team was led by M s . Jane Armitage, Country Director, Central Amer ica and included 
staff and managers representing each o f the key sectors. A small Government team, led 
by the V ice-M in is ter o f Finance, also attended the workshop. Workshop participants 
discussed the analysis that the Bank o f Costa Rica’s socio-economic development 
context as well as the objectives and pr ior i t ies considered in the draft o f the CPS. The 
Costa R ican Academic Program o f the L a t i n Amer ican Faculty o f Social Sciences 
(FLACSO), and the Central American Institute o f Bus iness Adm in is tra t ion ( INCAE) 
facilitated the workshop and played a key ro le in iden t i fy ing Costa R ican participants. 
Tak ing in to account the ma in emphases o f the CPS, the participant l is t included 
representatives f rom a range o f institutions such as trade unions, bus iness chambers, 
NGOs, research centers, academic institutions, churches, community organizations, 
environmental organizations, as w e l l as indigenous and afro-descendant organizations. 
Representatives f rom the mun ic ipa l governments o f San Jose and Puerto L im o n were 
also inv i ted to participate. P r io r to attending the workshop, participants we re prov ided 
a document ou t l in ing the ma in analytical conclusions and proposed program o f 
activities contained in the draft CPS. Other analytical documents prepared by the Bank 
on the current economic and social situation o f the Central American Reg ion were also 
distributed, together w i t h background in forma t ion on the W o r l d Bank, i t s institutional 
pr ior i t ies and i ts various support instruments. This was a set o f highly relevant 
in forma t ion to bring the participant’s perception on the W o r l d Bank up to date, in view 
o f the Bank’s l o w p ro f i le in Costa R ica over the past decade o r so. 

The consultation workshop was divided in to five sessions: a) an opening session w i t h 
welcoming remarks f rom representatives o f the Government o f Costa Rica, the 
fac i l i ta t ing institutions, and the W o r l d Bank; b) a plenary session, where W o r l d Bank 
representatives presented the ma in transformations in i t s ins t i tu t iona l m iss ion (poverty 
reduction and achievement o f the MDGs), along w i t h analytical considerations and the 
ma in objectives and strategy envisioned in the CPS for Costa Rica; c) a thematic break- 
out session during wh ich the Bank’s sector leaders fo r FPSI, PREM , HD and ESSD 
presen ted and discussed the specific issues and proposed assistance ac t iv i t ies fo r each 
sector w i t h c i v i l society representatives; d) a plenary session where rapporteurs 
presented and discussed comments and recommendations o f the thematic workgroups; 
and e) a closing session, where W o r l d Bank representatives addressed the comments 
and recommendations resulting f rom the workshop, and where the V ice-M in is ter o f 
Finance, on beha l f o f the Government o f Costa Rica, thanked participants for the ir 
feedback and inputs. Also, during the closing session Jane Armitage, the W o r l d Bank’s 
Country Director, reiterated the institution’s commitment to study with special interest 
the recommendations made at the consultation, share with participants the report o f the 
workshop, wh ich w i l l be annexed to the CPS document p r io r to submission to the 
Bank’s Board o f Execu t ive Directors, and to publish the f ina l CPS document approved 
by the Board o n the Bank’s external web-site fo r full pub l ic disclosure. 

T h e three thematic workgroups were organ ized accord ing to the three m a i n focus areas 
env is ioned in the dra f t document o f the CPS, w h i c h respond t o the needs and interest 
f o r suppor t expressed by the Governmen t o f Cos ta R ica . These were as fo l lows : 1. 
Business C l im a t e and Macroeconom ic Framework ; 2. Human Deve lopmen t : Health, 
Education, and Soc ia l Protection; and 3. the Env i ronmen t and A g n c u l t u r e ’. 
M a i n Comments and G en e r a l Recommendations o f the Consu ltat ion 

Rappor teurs o f the three groups ra ised a numbe r o f general concerns with respect t o 
ins t i tu t iona l , fiscal, soc ioeconom ic and env i ronmen ta l as w e l l as t e r r i t o r i a l issues f o r

In s t i tu t ion a l aspects: These i n v o l v e issues re la t ing t o the adm in istrat ive env ironment 
a n d immed ia te context o f the proposed actions. Within th is area, par t ic ipan ts stressed 
the impor tance o f increas ing the Bank ’s support f o r ins t i tu t iona l building to enhance 
cross-sectoral coord ina t ion within government and b e y o n d and t o strengthen the 
capac i ty o f k e y p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions t o assume s trong leadership roles. Within this sphere

w h i c h w o u l d con t inue t o be imp lemen ted despite changes in government. Participants 
also emphasized, in d i f fe ren t ways, their v i e w that the Bank c o u l d p l a y a stronger r o l e 
in fac i l i ta t ing dono r coord ina t ion , in order t o con t r ibu te t o mo re coherent and e f fec t ive 
ac t ion within the p u b l i c sector. 

F isca l aspects. Ove ra l l , par t ic ipan ts were v e r y mindful o f the gap between ava i lab le 
pub l ic revenues and legitimate demands fo r spending t o address c r i t i c a l soc io - 
econom ic needs. 
In th is context, par t ic ipan ts stressed the impor tance o f i d e n t i f y i n g 
areas in w h i c h scarce econom ic resources p a r t i c u l a r l y h i n d e r the governmen t ’s capac i ty 
t o de l iver and manage p u b l i c services a n d goods. T h e pa r t ic ipan ts a lso emphasized the 
need to achieve a wo rkab le balance be tween p ruden t a n d e f f i c i e n t use o f p u b l i c 
resources, a n d the a l loca t ion o f appropr ia te leve ls o f funding to address core soc ia l

Socioeconomic and env ironmenta l aspects. T h e var ious groups highlighted the

l inkages was o f interest t o a l l par t ic ipan ts , w h o approached the issue f r om their 
i n d i v i d u a l vantage po in ts . 

Par t ic ipan ts also considered i t im p o r t a n t f o r the B a n k t o support n e w env ironmenta l 
sustainability initiatives, as a comp lemen t t o the n o w we l l-es tab l ished p ionee r ing 
conserva t ion practices w h i c h have earned Cos ta R i c a w i d e in te rna t iona l recogn i t ion and 
h a d a ga lvan iz ing e f fec t o n t o u r i sm t o the coun try . These inc lude p a y i n g special 
a t ten t ion t o the prob lems d e r i v i n g f r o m the s e c a l l e d g ray agenda, associated with the 
p r o b l em o f environmental con tam ina t ion and i t s attendant econom ic and soc ia l issues. 
In th is regard, the par t ic ipan ts s t rong ly stressed the need f o r f inanc ia l sus ta inab i l i ty o f 
env ironmen ta l efforts. 

Par t ic ipan ts agreed that equ ity - bo th socio-economic and geographic - shou ld be a 
k e y h c t o r in the assessment o f inves tmen t p r io r i t ies . M u l t i p l e ca l ls we re made t o 
acknow ledge the existence o f m a j o r d i f ferences in we l fa re and l i v e l i h o o d s in Cos ta 
R ica , r e q u i r i n g d i f fe ren t ia ted a n d se lec t ive ac t ions t o address d iverse needs. Overa l l , 
pa r t ic ipan ts agreed that w h i l e Costa R ica 's h um a n deve lopmen t and pove r ty ind ica tors 
are mo re equitable than those o f mos t countries, households at the b o t t om o f the 
d i s t r i b u t i o n have s ign i f ican t ly d im i n i s h e d access t o soc ia l services and worse h um a n 
deve lopmen t indicators. In this context, several par t ic ipan ts made references t o the 
"average CR " and t o the "other CR", i n d i c a t i n g that i t shou ld b e a p r i o r i t y f o r the CPS 
t o highlight the gaps and the d ive rs i ty observed in the indicators. Further, they fe l t that 
the CPS shou ld emphasize the s i tua t ion o f exc luded groups, give p r i o r i t y to the need t o 
co l lec t mo re and better i n f o rm a t i o n t o r e f l e c t CR realities, and sys tema t ica l ly m o n i t o r 
the re levan t indicators. T h e s trong v iew , therefore, was that, within Cos ta R i c a ' s 
successful emphasis o n un ive rsa l p r o g r am coverage, w h i c h accounts f o r m a n y o f the 
soc ia l achievements o f the country, targe ted e f fo r ts are needed, ta i lo red t o the needs o f 
the exc luded groups. 

In l i n e with the above concerns, par t ic ipan ts s t rong ly emphasized the need t o in troduce 
te r r i to r ia l se lec t iv i ty mechanisms t o fac i l i ta te c l o s i n g the deve lopmen t gaps be tween 
d i f fe ren t regions. T h e y ind ica ted tha t t h i s requ ires recogn iz ing the d i f fe ren t dynamics

in f luence o n the success o r fa i lu re o f inves tmen t pro jec ts and p u b l i c po l ic ies . 

Las t ly , par t ic ipan ts in the var ious groups ra ised the cen t ra l ro l e that should b e 
g ran ted to pa r t ic ipa to ry practices. 
In t h e i r view, th is w i l l fac i l i ta te m a i n t a i n i n g a n

SPECIFIC THEMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS 

B u s i n e s s C l ima te and Mac ro -Econom ic E n v i r o nm e n t 
Explain at greater length the scope and achievements of the National Development Plan, and its 
relation to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). 
Provide more examples to substantiate how trade reduces poverty and generates employment. 
Provide participants with information on the initiatives the World Bank is already involved in with 
other multi-national institutions (IDB, CAF, CABEI). 
The water and sanitation project envisioned to be developed in San Jose's Great Metropolitan 
Area has more bearing on the social sphere than merely on the field of infrastructure. 

H um a n D e v e l o pm e n t 
General Recommendations 
Expressly consider the situation of afro-descendant, indigenous, and disabled populations in the 
strategy and operations supported by the World Bank. This implies keeping statistics and creating 
specific indicators with sufficient levels of desegregation, as well as sensitizing officials tasked with 
working with these populations. 
Include a component of communications for cultural change in the human development project. 
Discuss, not only the efficiency but also the volume of resources allocated to social investment, 
and even consider the possibility of programmatic lending to create an enabling environment for 
lonpterm investment programs in the social sector. 

Education 
Examine in greater depth the reasons conditioning student drop-out and low educational 
performance problems, thereby questioning the premise about the homogeneity of the Costa Rican 
educational model. 
Efforts to close the educational gaps should be emphatic in overcoming the backwardness of 
secondary education with respect to developed countries, while also considering the deficit in 
quality dragged on from previous year-levels. 

Health 
Assign high priority to regulation of the health sector given the growing presence of the private 
sector on these matters, and the existing separation of functions between the Costa Rican Social 
Security System (Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social) and the Ministry of Health. Regulation 
should be linked to social participation on health -an aspect not clearly reflected in the documents 
presented by the World Bank during this consultation. 
Give a major boost to information systems and to improve accountability toward users and toward 
civil society in general. 
Establish policy guidelines to attend to highrisk groups, in orderto optimize use of scant 
resources. 
Consider the possibility of providing World Bank support to review the overall model of allocation 
of human and financial resources for the social sector. Ultimately management problems are 
considered to be affecting the performance of services and the optimum use of resources. 

Soc ia l Protection 
In terms of social assistance, emphasis should be placed on supporting the poor with 
comprehensive intervention models -rather than through "poor programs for the poor people." 
Encourage a discussion on the possible creation of a Ministry of Social Development in the face of 
current inter-institutional coordination problems. At any rate, the Bank will necessarily have to 
support a dialogue aimed at rethinking the "Social Authority." 

The E n v i r o nm e n t 
Pay greater attention to providing specific support for the management of marine/coastal 
resources . 
Loans aimed at the environmental sector should benefit not only the private sector, but also 
protected public areas. 
Support the creation of sustainable activities that create alternative employment (ecotourism) 
Enhance coordination and information about programs and projects supported by the Bank 
through the Ministry of the Environment (MINAE). 
Favor the realization of more consultations on the Bank's support on environmental matters, with 
participation of a broader group of key players that did not take part in the CPS consultation. 
Coordinate with other multilateral and bilateral cooperation agencies, the support for implementing 
the National Environmental Strategy.
