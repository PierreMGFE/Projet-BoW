EXECUTTVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Country context. Once t h e most prosperous country in East A f r ica , Kenya’s economic 
performance worsened marked ly in the 1990s due t o ine f f ic ien t use o f pub l ic resources, loss o f 
economic competitiveness, soaring costs o f do ing business, deteriorating secur i ty conditions, and loss 
o f donor funding, wh ich led t o a s ign i f ican t f a l l in external capital in f lows during the 1990s. Poor 
governance practices led to a deterioration in the Bank Group’s relations with Kenya, and i t was in a 
l o w case lending scenario fo r several years. However, the elections o f December 2002 brought t o 
power a new government, and the pos i t ive steps i t has taken since a r r iv ing in o f f ice have created a 
much better env ironmen t fo r development results to occur. The government has started t o reverse the 
poor governance practices o f the past and enacted several key pieces o f an t i-corrup t ion legislation. I t 
has taken s teps t o improve pub l ic sector management. I t has prepared i t s Inves tmen t Program fo r the 
Econom ic Recovery Strategy fo r Wea l th and Emp loymen t Crea t ion (IP-ERS) with the full 
par t ic ipa t ion o f parliament, nongovernmental organizations, development partners, and other 
stakeholders ( i t s PRSP), discussed by the Bank’s Boa rd on M a y 6,2004 and by the Fund’s Boa rd on 
M a y 10,2004. I t has reached agreement with the IMF o n a new Pover ty Reduc t ion and G row th 
Fac i l i ty (PRGF) program, moved dec is ive ly o n imp rov ing relationships with donors, and developed 
new strategies fo r economic and social development.

11. 

Kenya’s Investment Program fo r the Economic Recovery Strategy. Kenya’s development 

objectives are articulated in the IP-ERS around three in ter l inked p i l lars : strengthening economic 
growth, enhancing equ i ty and reduc ing poverty, and imp rov ing governance. Based upon a highly 
par t ic ipa tory process, the IP-ERS envisages a strengthening o f the macroeconomic framework, an 
improved f isca l stance, and the unleashing o f pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion and investment. To improve 
equity and reduce poverty, i t focuses on un iversa l pr imary education, imp roved access t o basic health, 
expanded produc t ive capacity in agriculture, development o f the a r id and semi-arid lands, and 
upgrading living cond i t ions f o r the urban poor. To enhance governance, the program proposes far 
reaching re fo rm o f the jud ic ia ry , strengthening o f the rule o f l aw and security, and implementing 
reforms in pub l ic adm in is tra t ion to achieve increased transparency and accountability. The new 
government has also taken steps t o imp rove pub l ic sector strategy, 

iii. 

The World Bank Group’s strategy. This j o i n t Bank - IFC C A S (wh ich also had the full 

par t ic ipa t ion o f MIGA and WBI) i s c lose ly a l igned with the government’s IP-ERS . I t i s resu l ts - 
based’, and i t s r e s u l t s f ramewo rk draws selectively upon that o f the IP-ERS. I t proposes t o help 
Kenya achieve i t s development objectives through fou r basic areas o f support, re f lec t ing t h e Bank 
Group’s comparative advantage in i t s partnership with government and other donors: (a) strengthening 
pub l ic sector management and accountability, parastatal re fo rm and pr iva t iza t ion , and mon i to r ing and 
evaluation capacity; (b) reduc ing the cost o f do ing business and imp rov ing the investment climate, 
inc lud ing support fo r res truc tur ing the f inanc ia l sector, p romo t ing p r iva te sector development, 
imp rov ing infrastructure as the basis fo r economic growth, and reduc ing barr iers to trade; (c) reducing 
vu lnerab i l i ty and strengthening communities, inc lud ing support fo r increased ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty 
and competitiveness, imp roved env ironmen ta l management, strengthened loca l governments, and 
reduc ing poverty in the poorest ru ra l areas and urban slums; and (d) inves t ing in people, inc lud ing 
support fo r an improved understanding o f poverty, the hea l th sector, the educa t ion sector, and the 
national fight against HIVIAIDS. 

This i s not a formal results-based p i lo t CAS, and does not inc lude a CAS completion report. Because this i s a 
strategy o f re-engagement, the approach w i l l be to take advantage o f results-based methodology to provide the 
information fo r a full CAS completion report upon submission o f the next CAS.

iv . 
Lending program. The new government’s reforms have a l lowed Kenya to move f r om a l o w 
t o base case lending scenario under the previous CAS . The base case lend ing program assumes 
continued sound pub l ic sector management and macroeconomic performance, improvements in 
infrastructure service p rov is ion and in f inanc ia l intermediation, and imp roved po r t fo l io 
implementation. Under this scenario, the Bank Group wou ld undertake operations in key sectors 
identified in the IP-ERS, presenting four o r f ive projects a year t o the Board, with an emphasis in the 
two years o f the program on res tor ing infrastructure, increasing ag r icu l tu ra l produc t iv i ty , and 
p rov id ing techn ica l assistance and support fo r capacity building. This w o u l d be supported by core 
diagnostic econom ic and sector wo rk (ESW) that wou ld pe rm i t Kenya t o a t ta in a f i r s t Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Suppor t Cred i t (PRSC) in f isca l 2007. IFC ’s program w i l l complement IDA’S to: (a) 
strengthen pub l ic -p r iva te dialogue on imp rov ing the investment c l ima te and assist with 
imp lemen ta t ion o f key reforms; (b) attract the pr iva te sector t o p rov ide in fras truc tura l services and 
u t i l i t ies , inc lud ing energy and telecommunications; (c) help build and expand services o f compe t i t ive 
financial ins t i tu t ions ; (d) encourage development o f micro, small, and medium enterprise through 
expansion and in tegra t ion o f f inanc ing and technical assistance interventions; and (e) promote 
non trad i t iona l exports. 

v. 
The high case wou ld be triggered by (a) s ign i f ican t progress in rea l loca t ing pub l ic 
expenditures towards core pove r ty programs and in pub l ic sector f inanc ia l management, (b) 
establishment o f appropriate regu la tory frameworks fo r in fras truc tura l services, (c) reduced state 
con t ro l o f the bank ing sector, (d) strengthened loca l government capacity, (e) increased access o f the 
poor t o basic hea l th services, and (f) sustained improvement in the po r t fo l io . Unde r this scenario, 
support fo r the education SW A P wou ld be doubled, f rom US$50 m i l l i o n t o US$lOO m i l l ion , and 
support fo r the hea l th sector through a SWAP wou ld r i s e f r om US$30 m i l l i o n t o US$SO m i l l ion . A 
lending to ta l o f up to U S $ l . 1 b i l l i o n i s envisaged under this scenario. 

vi. 
A l o w case scenario wou ld be tr iggered by poor macroeconomic performance, fa i lure to 
fo l low through with imp lemen ta t ion o f key po l icy re forms underp inn ing IP-ERS goals, o r poor 
imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank-supported projects o r programs. Unde r this scenario, the Bank G roup wou ld 
prov ide funds at a s ign i f ican t ly reduced leve l in support o f operations in the soc ia l sectors o r t o reduce 
pover ty among vu lnerab le groups. A lend ing to ta l o f no more than US$365 m i l l i o n i s envisaged under 
this l o w case scenario. 

v i i . 
Nonlending program. The proposed non lend ing w o r k program i s designed to: (a) support 
efficient pub l ic a l loca t ion o f funds to p r io r i ty development areas, (b) expand on the ana ly t ica l wo rk 
already in i t ia ted in f isca l 2003 on pover ty analysis, pa r t icu la r ly in the ru ra l sector; (c) expand on the 
findings o f the C E M t o better understand the sources o f g row th and competitiveness; (d) better 
understand barriers t o trade; (e) support g row th in agr icu l tura l and l ives tock production; and (g) 
deepen know ledge o f labor markets. In preparation fo r an eventual PRSC, core diagnostic economic 
and sector w o r k has already been carr ied out, o r i s planned fo r the near te rm , inc lud ing a C F A A 
conducted in f isca l 2001, the C E M completed in f isca l 2003, and annual PERs. A C P AR and updated 
CFAA w i l l be carr ied ou t in f isca l 2005, as w i l l a pover ty analysis. The K e n y a coun try team i s 
significantly 
increasing i t s ou tpu t o f economic and sector w o r k t o i n f o rm b o t h po l icy and pub l ic 
dialogue on key development issues. 

v i i i . 
Implementation o f the portfolio. Imp roved imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank-supported po r t fo l io 
i s a ma jor theme o f this CAS . The new government’s comm i tmen t t o imp rov ing po r t fo l io 
performance was demonstrated during the Coun try Po r t fo l io Performance Rev iew (CPPR) that was 
held in January 2004-the 
f i r s t CPPR since 1997. An ac t ion p lan was developed and the CPPR 
committee w i l l mon i to r progress and repor t on a quar ter ly basis to government permanent secretaries.

ix. 
Risks. This CAS recognizes that there a re r i s k s in a situation such as Kenya’s. These include 
risks re la t ing t o po l i t ica l factors, to weak capacity, to poor governance, and t o external shocks. The 
CAS proposes a number o f m i t iga t ing measures, wh ich serve to reduce the Bank Group’s exposure to 
risk. 

x. 
CAS monitoring and evaluation. Mon i to r ing o f the Bank Group’s effectiveness w i l l take 
place bo th at the pro jec t leve l and at the leve l o f the overa l l assistance program. The core CAS 
benchmarks are der ived f rom IP-ERS targets. These benchmarks re f lec t the selective areas o f Bank 
invo lvemen t under the CAS, cover the key challenges that Kenya must address and fo r wh ich the 
Bank G roup i s best placed to assist; and are achievable within the CAS timeframe. At the m id-po in t 
o f the CAS period, the Bank w i l l rev iew the indicators and targets to assess progress in imp lemen t ing 
the assistance program, and adjust the Bank Group’s strategy as necessary.

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
On December 27,2002, Kenyan voters elected their f i r s t new president in 24 years, thereby 
ending the po l i t ica l dom ina t ion o f the par ty that had ru led Kenya since independence. The new 
government has made a clear break f rom the past. Impor tan t ly , i t has demonstrated in many ways i t s 
comm i tmen t t o e l im ina t ing corrup t ion and restoring the ru le o f law-an en t ire ly home-grown program t o 
improve governance. I t has enacted the An t i -Co r rup t ion Ac t , the Pub l ic O f f ice r E th ics Act, and the 
Pub l ic Audit Act, and expects soon t o enact leg is la t ion a imed at imp rov ing pub l ic procurement and 
f inanc ia l management. I t has appointed new senior s ta f f to key pos i t ions in government, inc lud ing the 
parastatals, and commissioned auditors to iden t i fy fraud and co r rup t ion in the pub l ic sector. Kenya has 
in i t ia ted a thorough inves t iga t ion o f the Goldenberg k ick -back scandal o f 1992 that sparked a f inanc ia l 
crisis and created a rift with key donors. A number o f senior judges w h i c h the government alleged to 
have been imp l ica ted in corrup t ion have also been dismissed. 

2. 
The new government has also taken steps t o imp rove pub l ic sector strategy. I t has prepared i t s 
Investment Program f o r the Econom ic Recovery Strategy f o r Wea l th and Emp loymen t Crea t ion (IP-ERS) 
with the full par t ic ipa t ion o f parliament, nongovernmental organizations, development partners, and other 
stakeholders ( i t s PRSP), discussed by the Bank’s Boa rd on M a y 6,2004 and b y the Fund’s Boa rd o n M a y 
10,2004. I t has reached agreement with the IMF on a new Pover ty Reduc t ion and G r ow t h Fac i l i ty 
(PRGF) program, moved dec is ive ly on imp rov ing relationships with donors, and developed new 
strategies fo r economic and social development. F ina l ly , it has demonstrated i t s comm i tmen t to sh i f t 
expenditure towards programs that bene f i t the poor, mos t no tab ly through i t s un iversa l free pr imary 
education program. 

3. 
T w o decades o f economic mismanagement have l e f t much o f Kenya ’s infrastructure in shambles 
and i t s ins t i tu t ions weak. W i t h the right investments and p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l reforms, Kenya has 
s ign i f ican t po ten t ia l fo r grow th . Good governance w i l l also imp rove the d is t r ibu t ion o f income. Kenya 
has one o f the most v ibran t and sophisticated pr iva te sectors in A f r ica , w h i c h i s ready and able t o respond 
to an improved investment c l ima te . Kenya’s transportation ne two rk o f air, sea, and road links already 
serves the entire East A f r ica region, W i t h improvements in management, p r iva te sector invo lvemen t and 
new investments, the ne two rk cou ld help t o reduce transportation costs across the region, strengthen 
access to the markets o f Kenya’s poorest regions, rev i ta l ize the East A f r i c a n Commun i ty (EAC), and 
foster wider reg iona l integration. 

4. 
To help Kenya rea l ize i t s potential, the coun try assistance strategy (CAS) proposes an ambitious 
program fo r the reengagement o f the Bank G roup with Kenya that i s a l igned with the government’s P- 
ERS and that i s roo ted in i t s results-based framework, f r om w h i c h the CAS ’S o w n result-based 
framework i s drawn. Together with the active por t fo l io , planned new IDA lend ing w i l l support the Kenya 
IP-ERS objectives o f s t imu la t ing g row th with equity, reduc ing poverty, and conso l ida t ing improvements 
in governance. New lend ing w i l l consist p r ima r i ly o f pro jec t-spec i f ic credits grounded in sectorwide 
approaches that the government i s deve lop ing with i t s development partners. The program w i l l also 
include adjustment credits a imed at strengthening budgetary management, f inanc ia l accountability, and 
po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l re forms . These w i l l imp rove the investment climate, and prepare the founda t ion

for Pover ty Reduc t ion Support Credits (PRSCs) and budget support f r om other donors. N e w lending w i l l 
be s ign i f ican t at the beg inn ing o f the C A S per iod to support urgently needed re forms and rehab i l i ta t ion o f 
infrastructure, and to compensate fo r the Bank’s exceptionally sma l l active po r t fo l io , a legacy o f seven 
years o f l o w case lend ing . Rema in ing in the base case w i l l be subject t o sustaining progress in pub l ic 
finance management, po l icy re forms in support o f pr iva te sector led growth, better pub l ic service 
delivery, and imp roved po r t fo l io implementation. M o v i n g to the high case w i l l p rov ide 30 percent more 
IDA resources fo r Kenya than the base case. This w i l l require in add i t ion to mee t ing base case triggers, 
the government t o make s ign i f ican t progress in rea l loca t ing pub l ic expenditures towards core pover ty 
programs and in pub l ic sector f inanc ia l management, and to make sustained improvemen t in 
imp lemen t ing Bank-supported projects. 

5 . 

In response t o the need fo r a un i f ied strategy o f the W o r l d Bank Group, t h i s C A S has been 
developed j o i n t l y with the I F C and MIGA t o ensure that our programs are mu tua l ly reinforcing, 
pa r t icu la r ly w i t h regard to imp rov ing the environment fo r investment and p r iva te sector-led growth. 
Kenya enjoys a strong p r iva te sector in comparison to many A f r ican countries and i s a p r io r i ty country fo r 
the IFC , and such a un i f ied strategy can he lp ensure that assistance i s de l ivered e f fec t ive ly and e f f ic ien t ly .

Economic Developments 

6. 

Once the mos t prosperous coun try in East A fr ica , Kenya has experienced economic decline, a f a l l 
in l i v i n g standards, and deterioration in the qua l i ty o f i t s institutions. Kenya’s ove ra l l economic 
performance worsened marked ly in the 1990s due t o ine f f ic ien t use o f pub l ic resources, loss o f economic 
competitiveness, soaring costs o f do ing business, deteriorating security conditions, and loss o f donor 
funding, wh ich led t o a s ign i f ican t f a l l in external cap i ta l in f lows during the 1990s. Average GDP g row th 
declined f r om about 7 percent in the 1970s to just over 2 percent during the 1990s, fa l l ing be low the 
average popu la t ion g row th rate o f 2.6 percent. Per capita income o f US$360 in 2003 was lowe r than i t s 
l e v e l in 1990.2

Pub l ic resources have been usedp r ima r i ly for wages and debt service rather than for cap i ta l 
investment and operations and maintenance. At 2 1 percent in 2002, Kenya mob i l izes a higher share o f 
revenues to GDP than mos t countries o f Sub-Saharan A f r ica . I f allocated appropriately, these resources 
wou ld be adequate to finance c r i t ica l soc ia l services and a s ign i f ican t share o f needed investment in 
infrastructure. During the 1990s, however, pub l ic sector wages (curren t ly around 8.4 percent o f GDP) 
and interest payments on domestic debt absorbed about h a l f o f to ta l government expenditures, leav ing 
few resources fo r cap i ta l expenditures o r de l ive ry o f essential services fo r pove r ty reduction. Spending 
on pub l ic sector wages rose from 29 percent o f to ta l government expenditures in 1990 t o 35 percent in 
200 1. Thus central government cap i ta l expenditures f e l l f r om about 20 percent o f government 
expenditures in 1990 t o 11 percent in 2001, or f t o m 6 percent o f GD P in 1990 t o 3 percent o f GD P in 

2001.

Lack of 
investment in i n ~ a s t r u c t u r e a n d p ~ b l i c services has worsened the climate for p r iva te 
investment, reduced access to services by the poo r , and c o n ~ i b u t e d to g row ing reg iona l inequities. The 
pub l ic sector continues to dominate the de l ive ry o f energy, telecommunications, transportation, and water 
services. The lack of investment in u t i l i t ies and infrastructure during the last decade comb ined with their 
poor management has s ign i f ican t ly constrained t h e g row th o f the economy by increas ing costs t o 
businesses and reduc ing competitiveness. U t i l i t i e s and infrastructure n o w requ ire substantial new 
investment if they are to de l iver services e f f ic ien t ly and re l iab ly . G iven the government’s budgetary

fo r divestiture and p r iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion programs.

E ~ t e r n a l ~ n a n c i n g declined. During the 1990s, o f f i c i a l transfers to Kenya f e l l as donors 
channeled resources fo r development through NGOs rather than through government. Lack o f support 
f rom donors resulted in a ne t ou t f low o f long and medium-term o f f i c i a l cap i ta l averaging almost 2 percent 
o f GDP a year during 1995-200 1. Performance in attracting and re ta in ing p r iva te external f inanc ing has 
been equa l ly poor. During the 1990s, the ra t io o f fore ign d irec t investment to GD P was on ly 0.4 percent 
compared with the 1.9 percent Sub-Saharan A f r ica average. 

Kenya has the potential for much higher growth and reduction ofpoverty. Unlike many other 

10. 
A f r ican countries, Kenya has diverse sources o f g row th in the pr imary , manufacturing, and services 
sectors, and a re la t ive ly v ib ran t and sophisticated pr iva te sector tha t i s prepared t o invest. The good 
performance o f some sectors and f i r m s during the 1990s indicates that with the right policies, institutions, 
and investments, Kenya can again become a ma jor economy in A f r ica . Ag r icu l tu ra l subsectors that have 
l i t t le d irec t government involvement, no tab ly smallholder tea, smallholder dairy, and f lo r icu l tu re and 
hor t icu l ture have responded dynam ica l ly to market opportunities, This g row th has occurred despite 
dec l in ing w o r l d prices in some markets (tea, fo r example) and a ve ry compe t i t ive environment in others 
(horticulture). Kenya has also become a leader in the race t o bene f i t f r om the U .S . A f r ican G row th and 
Oppor tun i ty A c t (AGOA), and the garment industry i s en joy ing a spectacular recovery. Factors such as 
e f f ic ien t ly run expor t processing zones, good a ir and sea transport links t o As ia and the United States, and 
a sk i l led wo rk fo rce have con tr ibu ted t o the good performance o f the garment industry. These attributes 
cou ld become impor tan t in a t trac t ing other businesses as the investment c l ima te improves. F ina l ly , a 
number o f in i t ia t ives to restructure pub l ic enterprises are n ow under consideration. Re forms should 
enable the enterprises t o become more e f f ic ien t and more compe t i t ive . The enactment o f the pr iva t iza t ion 
bill, anticipated soon, w i l l hrther he lp Kenya to reestablish i t s reg iona l p r imacy as a compe t i t ive open 
economy and destination fo r investment. 

Both development partners and private investors are again starting to support Kenya’s 

1 1. 
development. The new government’s re fo rm program aimed at s tab i l iz ing the economy and increasing 
the confidence o f donors and investors i s already hav ing a pos i t ive e f fec t . The IMF Boa rd approved the 
PRGF program on Novembe r 22,2003, and the Bank released the second tranche o f i t s Economic and 
Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm C red i t (EPSRC) soon after. Pr iva te sector investment increased somewhat in 2003 
and donors are show ing renewed interest after years o f suspended o r d im in ished funding programs. 
Donors pledged up to US$4 b i l l i o n fo r three years at the Consu l ta t ive G roup mee t ing he ld in November 
2003, subject to rap id and substantial progress in pub l ic sector re fo rm and improvements in the design 
and delivery o f basic services fo r the poor . In January 2004 the Paris C l u b agreed t o reschedule about 
US$350 m i l l i o n o f Kenya ’s arrears and maturities fa l l ing due between January 1,2004, and December 31, 
2006, freeing add i t iona l resources fo r p r io r i ty programs.

Soc ia l Developments 

Poverty rose in Kenya du r ing the 1990s and health and other social indicators deteriorated. The 

12. 
IP-ERS estimates that the p ropo r t ion o f the popu la t ion living in pove r ty rose f r om about 49 percent in 
1990 to more than 56 percent in 2003. In step with poor economic performance, key social indicators 
also worsened during the 1990s. En ro lmen t rates in p r ima ry schoo l dec l ined during the 1990s, although 
this has been reversed with the in t roduc t ion o f the f r e e p r ima ry educa t ion program . L i f e expectancy f e l l

These trends a re d i rec t ly l inked t o issues o fpub l ic management. For example, Kenyan citizens 

13. 
spend over 6 percent o f GDP on private health services, which suggests that i f government spending were 
focused on primary health facilities and cost-effective preventive programs such as immunization, health 
outcomes would have significantly improved during the past decade. Instead public spending has focused 
on curative care delivered in hospitals, which bene f i ts the relatively few. Government spending on 

- 5 - 

education amounts to about 7 percent o f GDP, most o f wh ich has been used t o finance teachers’ salaries. 
This has led t o inequities in enrolment and educational quality, as commun i t ies that cou ld no t a f fo rd to 
finance school cons truc t ion did no t bene f i t f rom state support. Parents were also ob l iged to pay fo r a 
var ie ty o f inc iden ta l expenses, inc lud ing textbooks, e f fec t ive ly p r ic ing poorer fam i l ies out o f the 
educational system. 

14. 
The d i ~ ~ i b u t i o n of 
income is unequal. The d is tr ibu t ion o f income in Kenya i s rather unequal as 
shown by i t s Gini coe f f ic ien t in 1997 o f about 0.42. Geographical variations in the d is tr ibu t ion o f poverty 
are also large, with about three quarters o f the poor l i v i n g in ru ra l areas. The arid and semiarid lands and 
Western and Nyanza provinces o f Kenya have par t icu lar ly high propor t ions o f people living be low the 
pover ty l ine , a r e s u l t o f disproportionately l o w investments in infrastructure and pub l ic services in these 
regions since independence. Kenya ranked 146 out o f 175 countries l is ted in UNDP ’s 2003 Human 
Development Repor t . This i s worse than i t s 1998 rank ing o f 137 ou t o f 174 countries, re f lec t ing the 
steady decline in the qua l i ty o f pub l ic services. 

Box 1: Kenya: Core labor standards 

Kenya has ratified seven o f the eight fundamental conventions o f the International Labor Organization related to core labor 
standards including: (a) Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention (ratified in 1964); (b) Forced Labor 
Convention (ratified i n 1964); (c) Abolition o f Forced Labor Convention (ratified in 1964); (d) Equal Remuneration 
Convention (ratified in 200 1); (e) Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (ratified in 2001); (0 Minimum 
Age Convention (ratified in 1979); and (8) Worst Forms o f Child Labor Convention (ratified i n 2001). Kenya has no t yet 
ratified the Freedom o f Association and Protection o f the Right to Organize Convention. 

Ch i ld labor. Although the proportion o f children (10-14 years o f age) who work has declined from 41.3 percent in 1995 to 
39.2 percent in 2000 and to 38.3 percent in 2002, child labor i s common, especially in the informal sector. About 1.9 m i l l ion 
children 5-17 years are in the labor force, including children working without pay (1998199 child labor survey, Central 
Bureau o f Statistics, 2001). To address this issue, the government (a) enacted in 2002 the Children’s Act, which provides the 
framework for universal primary education; (b) introduced the school feeding program targeting poor regions; (c) established 
the textbooks fund, which helps poor students purchase learning materials; and (d) created the bursary fund, which helps poor 
students meet some o f the costs related to secondaly school attendance. 

Gender discrimina~ion. The constitution o f Kenya prohibits discrimination on the basis o f gender. However, its provisions 
are not effectively enforced. Women experience a wide range o f both legal and actual discriminatory practices. The 
government has committed i t s e l f to eliminating discrimination i n its legislation, policies, and programs. I t has approved the 
national gender and development policy, which aims to provide equal opportunities to men and women. 

Forced Labor: While there i s no indication o f forced labor i n Kenya, the International Labor Organization has criticized 
certain legal provisions which provide chiefs i n rural areas with the possibility o f using forced labor. The government has 
repealed the laws concerned. In its latest report, the govemment indicates that comprehensive revision o f the labor law w i l l 
be undertaken in consultation with partners and with the technical assistance o f the International Labor Organization. 

2. KENYA ’S ECONOM IC RECOVERY STRATEGY 

15. 
The IP-ERS prov ides a f rank analysis o f the challenges in Kenya and lays ou t the government’s 
strategy to address these challenges. The strategy centers on three in te r l inked p i l lars : strengthening 
economic growth, enhancing equ i ty and reduc ing poverty, and imp rov ing governance. The IP-ERS 
contains a comprehensive results-based log ica l framework tha t lays ou t h o w the IP-ERS p r io r i ty 
programs w i l l con tr ibu te t o the achievement o f specific targets, inc lud ing the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs).

Fo l low ing two decades o f weakening economic growth, l o w p roduc t iv i ty and high 
unemployment, the f i r s t p r i o r i t y o f the IP-ERS i s t o rap id ly achieve high econom ic growth, c r i t ica l for

a t ta in ing a l l o f the government's other developmental objectives. The strategy calls fo r rede f in ing the 
ro le o f the state f r om producer t o fac i l i ta tor o f pr iva te sector-led g row th investment. To this end, the 
government comm i ts t o ma in ta in ing a stable macroeconomic framework, t o strengthening pub l ic 
expenditure management, to re fo rm ing the f inanc ia l sector, and t o encouraging pr iva te sector 
par t ic ipa t ion in the p rov is ion o f transportation, water, energy, and telecommunications services.

~ a c r o ~ c o n o m i c s tab i l i ty , i m p r o v e d ~ s c a ~ and monetary po l icy , and improved qua l i ty and 
quantity of expenditures in p r i o r i t y sectors are key. The macroeconomic framework underpinning the IP - 
ERS (table 2 ) foresees a steady p ick-up o f g row th f rom 1 .3 percent in 2002103 t o 2.5 percent in 2003104 
and t o 4.9 percent in 2006107. M o s t o f this w i l l likely come f r om rap id short-term g row th in 
manu fac tur ing and services f o l l ow i n g improvement in governance and the investment climate. In tandem 
w i t h the increase in the g row th rate, gross investment i s expected t o r i s e sharply. M o s t o f the increase in 
investment w i l l be financed by concessional external assistance. This w i l l pe rm i t the government to 
reverse i t s past dependence o n domestic bo r row ing and thereby free add i t iona l bank lending fo r the 
pr iva te sector. The overa l l government budget deficit, inc lud ing g ran ts , i s projected to remain at about 3 
t o 4 percent o f GD P t o fund government spending in p r io r i ty sectors during the i n i t i a l years o f the 
program, be fore dec l in ing to 2 .6 percent in 2007108 as revenues rise. The external current account de f ic i t 
i s projected t o r ise rap id ly f r om 1 .3 percent o f GDP in 2002103 t o about 10 percent o f GDP by 2006107 
due to increases in impor ts associated with renewed pub l ic and p r iva te investment.

ExternalJinancing and debt s u s t a i n a b i l i ~ . Kenya’s outstanding stock o f external debt at the end 
o f 2002103 stood at US$4.7 b i l l i o n (36 percent o f GDP) with IDA debt ob l iga t ions accounting fo r almost 
50 percent o f the total. During the 1990s the government continued t o service i t s debt, bringing down the 
debt service payments f rom 34 percent o f expor t o f goods and services in 1990 to 11 percent in 2003. 
The debt service t o exports ra t io i s expected t o decline steadily to about 7.2 percent in 2008 and then edge 
upwards thereafter. In 2003, the ne t present value o f debt-to-exports ra t io was 109 percent. I t i s expected 
t o rema in stable in v iew o f the recent agreement o f the Paris C lub t o reschedule debts under Hous ton 
terms t o con tr ibu te to the f inanc ing p lan envisaged under the IMF program. The po ten t ia l fo r high l e v e l s 
o f concessional support that cou ld be made available during the next f i v e years w i l l also be an important 
s tab i l iz ing factor. 

19. 
Reforms ofpublic expenditure management are planned to improve a l loca t ion of resources. To 
establish expenditure management consistent with sustained g row th and pover ty reduction, the 
government w i l l imp lemen t a tight f isca l po l icy wh ich reduces domestic debt, refocuses o n expenditures 
in favor o f development and pover ty reduction, and improves the e f f ic iency o f pub l ic spending. Annua l

IP-ERS pillar 3: Improving governance 

27 . 
The IP-ERS recognizes that poor economic governance, inc lud ing high levels o f corrup t ion and 
poo r management o f pub l ic resources, has been a ma jor drag o n Kenya’s economic and social 
development. The government i s comm i t ted to e l im ina t ing corruption, res tor ing the ru le o f law and 
bringing about equitable development that favors a l l citizens. I t has enacted and i s imp lemen t ing the 
Econom ic Cr imes A c t (2003 ) , wh ich prov ides fo r the establishment o f an An t i -Co r rup t ion Commission. 
I t created a new department o f governance and ethics in the O f f ice o f the President. T o reduce corrup t ion 
in the pub l ic service, the government enacted the Pub l ic O f f ice rs E th ics A c t in 2003 , wh ich requires a l l 
pub l ic o f f ic ia ls ( inc lud ing the president), employees, and the i r fam i l ies to declare the ir assets. The 
government has also taken several actions to improve the dispensation o f jus t ice , O f key importance i s 
the establishment o f the Ministry o f Justice and Cons t i tu t iona l A f fa irs , wh ich i s responsible fo r po l icy on

Summary o f IP-ERS staff assessment 

29 . 
The IP-ERS prov ides a sound basis fo r Bank G roup and other donor support. I t s p r ima ry 
strengths l i e in i t s s trong emphasis on imp rov ing governance and res tor ing the ru le o f law, and the scope 
o f the par t ic ipa tory process through wh ich the strategy was prepared. A l s o impor tan t i s i t s focus on 
resu l ts through inc lus ion o f a comprehensive mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion framework with targets tha t 
refer to the MDGs as benchmarks and a time frame fo r achievement. The staffs note, however, several 
shortcomings that w i l l need t o be addressed during implementation. First, i t s analysis o f pover ty needs 
to be strengthened by expand ing the in fo rma t ion base through surveys and strengthening the analysis o f 
the determinants o f pover ty . Second, the strategy cou ld better p r io r i t ize p o l i c y actions t o accelerate 
grow th and reduce pove r ty and prov ide a more precise iden t i f ica t ion o f core pro-poor spending 
programs. Third, a sector strategy fo r hea l th remains to be formulated, and a strategy fo r education 
completed that w o u l d map ou t programs fo r accelerating t h e pace f o r ach iev ing the MDGs. Fourth, the 
strategy cou ld better ar t icu la te a process fo r the p r io r i t iza t ion o f pub l ic actions that are in turn linked to 
the budget and med ium- term expenditure framework . Fifth, the actions contemplated to build capacity 
in key areas need to be c lea r ly spelled out, inc lud ing the support envisaged f r om the donor commun i ty . 
Sixth, systems fo r mon i to r ing pove r ty outcomes are weak and need t o be strengthened. F ina l ly , the 
outcomes o f the future consu l ta t ion processes and pove r ty diagnoses need to be better described, linked 
to, and reflected in the selection o f targets, p o l i c y pr ior i t ies , and budget allocations.

THE BANK GROUP’S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

30. 
This C A S i s a strategy o f reengagement. The environment f o r s t imu la t ing g row th with equity and 
reduc ing pover ty in Kenya through Bank programs has become considerably better during the past year 
due to the new government’s actions a imed at imp rov ing governance and implementation, and to i t s focus 
on resu l ts . 

3 1. 

An en t ire ly new generation o f projects and programs w i l l be put in place that are closely aligned 
with Kenya’s IP-ERS, and that incorporate lessons f rom the past t o improve imp lemen ta t ion and resu l ts . 
The projects and programs w i l l b u i l d o n lessons learned f rom a full program o f ana ly t ica l work, 
developed with a v iew to understanding the comp lex relationship between economic growth, pover ty 
reduction, and governance. Pro jec t lending in sectors w i t h sound po l ic ies and strategies ( fo r example 
transport and energy) w i l l he lp to strengthen institutions and f inanc ing mechanisms that deepen and 
nur ture good governance. Ad jus tmen t lending w i l l support c r i t ica l po l icy re forms in pub l ic sector 
management and the f inanc ia l sector. Techn ica l assistance projects w i l l develop, and assist in 
implementing, pub l ic sector reforms, privatization, and lega l and f inanc ia l sector reforms. In l ine with 
our comm i tmen t t o donor harmonization, subsequent interventions w i l l support sectorwide approaches in 
hea l th and education, ca ta lyz ing budget support fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f the P - E R S through PRSCs. 

32. 
The o n g o i n g ~ g h t against corrup t ion is a cross-cutting issue. The Bank G roup considers i t an 
imperative t o support the government in i t s effort t o stop corrup t ion by incorpora t ing an t i-corrup t ion 
measures wherever possible in i ts projects. This includes operations, such as the lega l re fo rm component 
o f the F inanc ia l and Lega l Techn ica l Assistance Cred i t (FLSTAC , 2005) pro jec t discussed below, that 
build capacity against corrup t ion in a targeted manner. I t also includes ma ins tream ing throughout the 
Bank’s po r t fo l io measures to improve safeguards within government at the cen tra l and loca l levels. I t 
means care fu l attention at the time o f pro jec t and program preparation t o safeguard measures, inc lud ing 
hav ing the Bank’s Ins t i tu t iona l Integrity Department participate in the design phase o f projects. I t also 
means ensuring that M&E systems b o t h within Bank projects and within government con ta in means fo r 
mon i to r ing against r i s k s o f corruption. And it means p romo t ing transparency and open communication 
with stakehoiders about budgetary issues, procurement, and pro jec t management. I t i s vital that Kenyans 
own these measures, and that they genu ine ly support and complement Kenya ’s o w n an t i-corrup t ion 
program. 

3 3 . 

The Bank Group’s coun try assistance strategy i s organized around fou r themes, representing i t s 
comparative advantage vis-a-vis other donors: strengthening pub l ic sector management and 
accountability, reduc ing t h e cost o f do ing business and imp rov ing the investment climate, reduc ing 
vu lne rab i l i ty and strengthening communities, and investing in people. Ac t iv i t ies o f the fou r themes 
contribute to each of the three p i l la rs o f Kenya’s IP-ERS, summarized in a m a t r i x at the end o f each 
section. In add i t ion to specific operations targe t ing one o r more objectives o f the IP-ERS, the Bank w i l l 
support the IP-ERS generally in i t s operations as cross-cutting issues. Thus, fo r example, Bank 
operations to improve pub l ic sector management, simultaneously address issues o f economic growth, o f 
equity and pover ty reduction, and o f imp roved governance. By mak ing exp l ic i t the links between Bank 
supported sector ac t iv i t ies and IP-ERS goals, the ma tr ixes be low p rov ide the skeleton fo r the set o f CAS

Strengthening public sector management and accountability 

34. 
The fundamen ta l challenge fac ing the government i s to restructure the pub l ic sector to channel 
resources to inves t in c r i t ica l infrastructure and to deliver social services tha t bene f i t the poor. This 
requires better strategic budgeting and re th ink ing the core functions o f government, a po l icy-mak ing 
process tha t re f lec ts the trade-offs between different programs, and re fo rm o f the c i v i l service t o produce 
a more e f f ic ien t and e f fec t ive pub l ic administration. I t also invo lves a s ign i f ican t strengthening o f c i v i l 
society’s overs igh t o f government spending. F ina l ly , i t implies a substantial re fo rm o f parastatals to 
a l low government t o focus on i t s core ro le o f formu la t ing po l icy , prepar ing and en fo rc ing regulations, and 
fac i l i ta t ing p r iva te sector investment. 

Pub l ic sector management 

3 5 . 
The Bank i s suppor t ing the government’s re fo rm program in several ways. I t s Pub l ic Sector 
Management Techn ica l Assistance Program, due t o end in f isca l 2005, i s p rov id ing support fo r c i v i l 
service re fo rm and capacity building, in terna l auditing, development o f the MTEF , implementation o f the 
integrated f inanc ia l management in fo rma t ion system (IFMIS), and development o f improved procurement 
practices. The pro jec t also supports re forms o f key jud ic ia1 systems, such as cour t record ing and case 
management. During the CAS period, the new Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm Techn ica l Assistance project w i l l 
b u i l d upon the progress made under the current project, supporting governmen t-w ide re forms such as 
ra t iona l iza t ion o f the func t ions and structure o f government ministries; c i v i l service reforms; 
strengthening o f the Kenya Revenue Au thor i ty , and pub l ic expenditure management, inc lud ing deepening 
o f the MTEF and extension o f the IFIMIS throughout the government. This pro jec t w i l l also prov ide 
support fo r regu la tory re fo rm and fo r capac i ty-bu i ld ing t o lay the g roundwo rk f o r parastatal re fo rm and 
pr iva t iza t ion (see below). 

36. 
The Bank i s p rov id ing ana ly t ica l support fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f a robus t pub l ic expenditure 
rev iew process that examines in depth the value and e f f ic iency o f pub l ic spending, and budget 
performance. This w i l l lead t o preparation o f j o i n t government-donor P ER reports as the basis fo r the 
MTEF program. As part o f the annual PER work, the Bank w i l l also assist l i n e ministries, par t icu lar ly in 
health, education, and agriculture, t o develop sectoral expenditure programs. T o imp rove transparency, 
the results o f the pub l ic expenditure rev iews w i l l be discussed with stakeholders in c i v i l society and the 
relevant parliamentary committees. M in is te r ia l pub l ic expenditure reviews w i l l also exp l ic i t ly take in to 
account and in fo rm the g row th and pover ty reduc t ion objectives o f the IP-ERS. Consistent with these 
objectives, and as a v i t a l underp inn ing to future PRSCs, the Bank w i l l ca r ry ou t a coun try procurement 
assessment rev iew (CPAR) in f isca l 2005 j o i n t l y with the government as pa r t o f the PER wo rk . 

37. 
L o o k i n g forward, the Bank w i l l prepare a Programmatic S truc tura l Ad jus tmen t Cred i t (PSAC) fo r 
fiscal 2005. The PSAC, complemented by annual PERs, i s expected t o he lp the government t o improve 
i ts budget and f inanc ia l management, inc lud ing the capacity t o t rack pover ty-re la ted spending, to attain 
high levels o f f iduc ia ry accoun tab i l i ty and transparency, and t o shift spending towards ac t iv i t ies that 
benefit the poor. The P S AC i s also expected to in i t ia te re forms in agr icu l ture and pub l ic ly operated

Paras ta ta l reform and p r iva t iza t ion 

38 . 
Parastatal re fo rm w i l l make an impor tan t con t r ibu t ion t o g row th and governance by increasing 
the efficiency and competitiveness o f pub l ic enterprises, and by reduc ing oppor tun i t ies fo r

39 . 
Rather than support the parastatal re fo rm and pr iva t iza t ion process v i a a single credit, wh ich 
w o u l d no t adequately address the large number o f differences between enterprises according t o sector, 
and wh ich w o u l d risk impos ing a single p lan on parastatals undergo ing re fo rm and p r iva t iza t ion a i 
d i f fe ren t paces, the Bank w i l l support parastatal re fo rm through i t s budget support, techn ica l assistance 
projects and sector operations under an overarching strategy f o r pr iva te sector development. The PSAC 
w i l l support parastatal reforms and p rov ide technical assistance to prepare the ground fo r the pr iva t iza t ion 
o f telecommunications and ra i lways concessioning. The Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm Techn ica l Assistance 
Pro jec t ( f isca l 2006) w i l l seek to strengthen the investment climate, imp lemen t ing the po l icy conclusions 
o f E SW in this area (discussed below). Because the Bank’s support fo r parastatal re fo rm i s embedded in 
d i f fe ren t sector operations, this pro jec t w i l l also serve to p rov ide the core ins t i tu t iona l and regulatory 
support on w h i c h the success o f these e f for ts w i l l depend. T o strengthen governance, t h i s pro jec t w i l l 
re in force the key ins t i tu t ions responsible fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f t h e program, support t ra in ing o n 
regu la tory and other issues, assist the preparation o f corporate res truc tur ing and pr iva t iza t ion plans, 
strengthen the capacity and design o f regu la tory bodies, and imp rove consultative mechanisms between 
pub l ic and p r iva te actors. Bank- f inanced projects w i l l address parastatal re fo rm in various sectors. Fo r 
example, the Energy Sector Recovery C red i t ( f isca l 2005) w i l l fac i l i ta te the p r iva t iza t ion o f the Kenya 
Power and Lighting Company; and the F L S T A C ( f isca l 2005) w i l l fac i l i ta te divestiture o f the state’s

The Bank G roup and development partners are assisting the government t o establish the 
framework fo r mon i to r ing and evaluation o f po l icy and expenditure decisions through a number o f 
in i t ia t ives . An IDF grant i s helping bo th to strengthen the statistical system and t o build capacity fo r

Box 2: Kenya membership o f international and regional economic agreements 

Dur ing the past decade Kenya has pursued an active po l icy o f engagement in regional and bilateral trade 
agreements. The country i s currently a member o f various international and regional economic organizations, 
including the EU -A f r ica Caribbean Pacific (ACP) Cotonou Agreement, EAC, COMESA, Inter-Govemmental 
Au thor i ty on Development (IGAD), and the N i l e Basin Initiative, 

Kenya i s a signatory o f the Cotonou Agreement between the European Un ion and the ACP countries, which 
replaces the Lome Convention. As part o f the agreement it benefits from special trade preferences granted by 
the E U and from resources from the European Development Fund. One o f the objectives o f the Cotonou 
Agreement i s that the ACP member states en ter into regional economic partnership agreements w i th the EU, 
which should lead to the gradual establishment o f bilateral f ree trade areas through a transition period starting 
in 2008. Although negotiations have not yet started at the sub regional level, Kenya w i l l participate through i t s 
membership in the eastern and southern A fr ica group. 

A t the regional level, Kenya together w i th Uganda and Tanzania form the EAC . The present EAC i s a rev iva l 
o f the previous East A fr ican cooperation agreement between Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, which collapsed in 
1977 and was reestablished in the 1990s. The objective o f the new EAC treaty, wh ich entered into force in July 
2000, i s to develop policies and programs aimed at widening and deepening cooperation among the th ree 
member countries. In this endeavor, the three countries have committed to the form a customs union b y 2004, 
wh ich i s then to evolve in to a common market, a monetary union and ultimately, a po l i t ica l federation o f East 
A fr ican states by 2020. Kenya i s seeking further reductions in non tar i f f trade barriers and exceptions in the 
trade regime, which w i l l facilitate regional integration. 

Since i t s relaunch in 2000, the EAC has successfully implemented many o f the provisions o f i t s treaty. Areas 
where significant progress on regional coord ina t io~harmon iza t ion has been achieved are monetary and 
financial policy, fiscal po l icy and taxation, capital markets development, and Lake V ic tor ia management. The 
customs union protocol was signed by the three countries in March 2004 and i s expected to be launched b y 
September 2004. I t provides for the establishment o f a common external ta r i f f b y July 2004 and the formation 
o f a regional free trade area, to be achieved gradually over a five-year period, A n East A fr ican passport was 
launched in 200 1 but i s s t i l l no t in full use. 

Kenya i s also a member o f COMESA, wh ich was initiated in Kampala in 1993 as the successor organization o f 
the Preferential Trading Area. COMESA currently comprises 20 member countries. I t s ma in agenda i s to 
deepen and broaden the integration process among member states through the fac i l i ta t ion and promotion o f 
regional trade and investment. In October 2000, nine COMESA members, including Kenya, established the 
COMESA f r e e trade area, w i th the r e s t expected to j o i n during the next couple o f years. COMESA members 
have also agreed to move to a customs union b y 2004, wh ich includes the establishment o f a common external 
tariff. 

The N i l e Basin Initiative i s a regional partnership that was established in February 1999 b y the riparian states 
o f the N i l e basin to pursue a cooperative approach for the use and development o f the common N i l e Basin 
water resources. Kenya i s also one o f the seven member countries o f the IGAD , wh ich was established in 
January 1986 in D j ibou t i w i th the purpose to alert t h e international community and members to humanitarian 
emergencies in the region. Under the auspices o f IGAD, Kenya i s p lay ing a key ro le in fac i l i ta t ing the peace 
processes underway in the subregion, especially in Sudan and Somalia,

Strengthening local governments

Strengthening loca l government i s recognized by Kenyans as an impor tan t factor in imp rov ing 
de l ive ry o f services. The current cons t i tu t iona l review process i s propos ing a strengthened devo lu t ion o f 
power t o loca l government, redefining the current dualistic system o f loca l ly elected councils and the top 
down structures o f p rov inc ia l adm in is tra t ion and l ine ministries. The Bank i s assisting this process in 
several ways. I t f inanced j o i n t l y with DFID an assessment o f loca l service de l ivery and loca l 
governments in Kenya tha t iden t i f ied the demands on loca l government t o de l iver services, and the 
techn ica l and f inanc ia l resources at the ir disposal to meet the demands. Ana ly t ica l w o r k scheduled for 
fiscal 2006 w i l l examine the impac t o f decentralization o n the effectiveness o f pub l ic spending in 
de l ive r ing services t o the poor. Techn ica l assistance i s strengthening loca l authorities t o e f fec t ive ly carry 
ou t the ir responsibilities. The proposed Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm Techn ica l Assistance Project ( f isca l 2006) 
and the PRSC ( f isca l 2007 ) w i l l draw o n ana ly t ica l wo rk carr ied ou t in 2000 focus ing on strengthening 
legal, institutional, technical and procedural reforms at bo th the central and loca l levels. Once the lega l 
structures are agreed and set in place through the new constitution, and m i n im a l re forms are implemented, 
Bank resources w i l l fund basic infrastructure. The Bank’s support to loca l government i s re in forced and 
complemented by the Bank’s commun i ty d r iven development (CDD) operations and i t s proposed urban 
slum upgrad ing p i lo ts , wh ich are a imed at building loca l institutions and strengthening communities. 

Reducing poverty i n Kenya’s poorest regions and urban slums

The Bank i s supporting ru ra l development in Kenya’s poorest regions. Th rough the Arid Lands 
Resource Management Project Phase 2, the Bank i s using a multisectoral, d is t r ic t based, C D D approach t o 
reduce pover ty in the arid and sem iar id d is tr ic ts o f Kenya. This successful approach, focus ing on 
management o f na tura l resources and drough t and o n ru ra l service delivery, i s be ing expanded f rom 11 to 
22 districts. The Bank w i l l fur ther support an expansion o f the C D D approach through a planned Western 
Kenya Commun i ty D r i v e n Deve lopmen t operation ( f isca l 2007). This w i l l target Nyanza and Western 
provinces, areas that are especially ha rd hit by the MVJ’AIDS pandemic and a degrading na tura l resource 
base. 

70. 
Dep le t ion of the na tura l resource base poses a rea l threat t o ru ra l l ive l ihoods . The Western Kenya 
Integrated Ecosystem Management Pro jec t together with the Ag r icu l tu re P roduc t iv i ty Pro jec t and the

Women are more l i k e l y than men t o be poor, and, vulnerable t o adverse shocks than men. A l l the 
Bank’s projects to reduce pover ty in Kenya’s poorest regions and slums inc lude ac t iv i t ies t o reduce 
gender inequ i t ies . Fo r example, the Arid Lands pro jec t uses par t ic ipa tory techniques t o ensure that 
women’s preferences are taken i n t o account in a l l decisions regard ing project-supported activities. The 
pro jec t i s also lead ing by example, by ensur ing equal oppor tun i ty o f emp loymen t f o r pro jec t staff. 
Similarly, the Ag r icu l tu ra l P roduc t iv i ty Pro jec t i s mak ing a special e f fo r t t o rec ru i t women extension

Understanding o f the dynamics, depth, and d is t r ibu t ion o f pove r ty in Kenya i s limited. The Bank 
and development partners are n o w supporting the government in s ign i f ican t ly deepening the knowledge 
o f poverty. The Bank supported the Strategic Gender Assessment, launched in f isca l 2004, that reveals 
the high pover ty and vu lne rab i l i ty o f many Kenyan women and describes the d iscr im ina t ion that girls and 
women face in ga in ing access t o hea l th and education services, and u l t ima te ly t o employment 
opportunities. The Bank and partners are supporting the Cen tra l Bu reau o f Statistics in produc ing poverty 
maps. The f i r s t vo lume was completed in f isca l 2004 and the second vo lume i s p lanned f o r f isca l 2005. 
The Bank i s also assisting the Cen tra l Bureau o f Statistics t o conduc t an integrated household budget 
survey. This w i l l p rov ide the baseline data that w i l l enable the government to mon i to r the impac t o f i t s

Ano ther high p r io r i ty re f lec ted in the IP-ERS i s hea l th sector re fo rm with the objective o f 
s ign i f ican t ly imp rov ing hea l th outcomes, especially o f the poor. The Bank considers gains in human 
hea l th c ruc ia l elements o f a comprehensive approach to pover ty reduc t ion and i s supporting the 
government’s strategy through ana ly t ica l work, capacity building, and targeted interventions. Ana ly t ica l 
w o r k i s focus ing on a pharmaceutical sector rev iew ( f isca l 2005), and on a comprehensive health sector 
pub l ic expenditure rev iew . Ongo ing projects inc lude the Decentralized AIDS and Reproductive Hea l th 
Project. This seeks to improve mo ther and c h i l d health through more integrated de l ivery o f ch i ld 
survival, reproduc t ive health, and HIVIAIDS services. This pro jec t i s also he lp ing t o increase the 
e f f ic iency o f the government in de l ive r ing these services, inc lud ing through decentralization o f service 
delivery. This operation i s prepar ing the ground fo r the Bank ’s support to the hea l th sector through a 
SWAP in f isca l 2006 that w i l l be developed in partnership with a l l ma jor stakeholders in the sector. This 
w i l l be based o n an agreed hea l th sector strategy, a medium-term expenditure program, and include 
annual expenditure reviews, and a j o i n t M&E framework. The elaboration o f a new na t iona l health 
strategy has recen t ly started. While the credits fo r the sector w i l l prov ide flexible, programmatic support 
f o r annual w o r k plans agreed at annual j o i n t reviews, IDA funds are expected t o support p r ima r i ly the 
ministry’s decentralization program and the re fo rm o f the med ica l supplies subsector. A successful 
SWAP w i l l establish the foundation, through capacity building and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening, fo r 
possible future support to the sector through a PRSC in f isca l 2007. A large number o f b i la tera l and 
mu l t i la te ra l donors, organized in the donor coord ina t ion group on health and HIVIAIDS, share the v is ion 
o f j o i n t l y suppor t ing the government’s hea l th strategy and MTEF, either through para l le l o r co f inanc ing 
mechanisms, and are ha rmon iz ing their procedures t o achieve this.

Government ac t ion i s starting t o prove e f fec t ive in the fight against HIVIAIDS. The HIVIAIDS 
prevalence rate among women a t tend ing prenatal c l in ics f e l l f r om a peak o f 10.2 percent in 2002 
(corrected estimate) t o 9.4 percent in 2003. The IP-ERS recognizes tha t building on this success i s

near ly one m i l l i o n AIDS orphans poses a ma jo r challenge, A l though many organizations are supporting 
orphans and vulnerable children, a mechanism i s needed t o coordinate the mu l t ip le in i t ia t ives . Another 
challenge i s mon i to r ing and eva lua t ing HnrIAIDS prevalence and i t s impact. Wh i le the sentinel 
surveillance system in Kenya func t ions well, other aspects o f the HIV ep idem ic and i t s impac t on the 
macroeconomy, the pr iva te sector, and households are captured with far less accuracy and frequency. 

76. 
The Bank i s v igo rous ly suppor t ing the government’s program. Kenya was the f i r s t coun try to 
access funds under the A f r i c a Reg ion ’s Mu l t i -Coun t ry A I D S Program (MAP). The pro jec t serves as the 
mode l fo r many subsequent M A P S . The Bank supports the Na t iona l AIDS Con t ro l Counc i l and i t s

activities. I t also supports in i t ia t ives o f c i v i l society, the p r iva te sector, and research organizations. By 
December 2003, the Bank had supported some 1,400 commun i ty - leve l in i t ia t ives , wh ich has opened

while also supporting new in i t ia t ives t o reach the vu lnerab le groups and t o increase access t o 
comprehensive care and treatment by those already infected. The Bank j o i n t l y with other partners i s also

Lend ing scenarios 

80. 
Base case lending scenario. Because the new government took charge o f the development 
agenda and moved qu ick ly t o make key reforms in po l icy and governance, Kenya has moved f rom a l o w 
to a base case lending scenario. S ign i f ican t improvements in po r t fo l io imp lemen ta t ion together with 
tighter f inanc ia l management, procurement and audit procedures de l ivered a higher leve l o f confidence in 
the country’s ab i l i ty to implement i t s po r t fo l io successfully. The base case lend ing program o f about 
US$870 m i l l i o n ( f isca l 2004-07) assumes continued sound macroeconomic performance and timely 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the IP-ERS. Under this scenario, IDA wou ld support operations in key sectors 
iden t i f ied in the IP-ERS, presenting fou r or five projects a year to the Boa rd (exc lud ing reg iona l projects), 
with an emphasis in the f i r s t two years o f the program on support f o r techn ica l assistance and capacity 
building. The excep t ion to this wou ld be the two ma jo r infrastructure investment programs (Northern 
Co r r ido r and Energy Sector Recovery) where the need i s urgent, and where the Bank considers the key 
ins t i tu t iona l and regu la tory prerequisites fo r pro jec t success t o be in place. 

8 1. 
H i g h case lending scenario, The high case wou ld be triggered by (a) s ign i f ican t progress in 
rea l loca t ing pub l ic expenditures towards core pover ty programs and in pub l ic sector f inanc ia l 
management, (b) establishment o f appropriate regulatory frameworks f o r in fras truc tura l services, (c) 
reduced state con t ro l o f the bank ing sector, (d) increased access o f the poo r t o basic hea l th services, and 
(e) sustained improvemen t in the lend ing po r t fo l io . Unde r th is scenario, support fo r the education SWAP 
wou ld be doubled, f r om US$50 m i l l i o n to US$lOO m i l l ion , and support fo r the hea l th sector through a 
SWAP wou ld r ise f r om US$30 m i l l i o n to US$SO m i l l ion . Sound ins t i tu t iona l and po l icy re fo rm and 
imp lemen ta t ion performance in infrastructure wou ld lead t o a near doub l ing o f support fo r water and 
sanitation services and slum upgrad ing in N a i r o b i and Mombasa f r om US$30 m i l l i o n t o US$50 m i l l ion . 
A lend ing to ta l o f up to US$l. 1 b i l l i o n i s envisaged under this scenario. 

82. 
Low case lending scenario. A l o w case scenario w o u l d be tr iggered by poo r macroeconomic 
performance, failure to fo l low through with imp lemen ta t ion o f key p o l i c y re forms underp inn ing IP-ERS 
goals, o r poo r imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank-supported projects o r programs. Unde r this scenario, t h e Bank 
wou ld prov ide funds at a significantly reduced leve l in support o f operations in the social sectors or to 
reduce pover ty among vu lnerab le groups. A lend ing to ta l o f n o more than US$365 m i l l i o n i s envisaged 
under this l o w case scenario. 

83. 
IDA grant allocation. In accordance w i t h the IDA 13 imp lemen ta t ion guidelines, Kenya w i l l 
receive a po r t ion o f i t s future IDA a l loca t ion in the f o rm o f grants. The to ta l f isca l 2004 grant a l loca t ion 
o f US$30.7 m i l l i o n has been allocated t o finance the G loba l Deve lopmen t Lea rn ing N e tw o r k Project 
(US$2.7 m i l l ion) , the N a i r o b i Water and Sewerage Ins t i tu t iona l Res truc tur ing Pro jec t (US$15 m i l l ion) , 
and the Ag r icu l tu re P roduc t iv i ty Pro jec t (US$13 m i l l ion ) . F o r subsequent years, the IDA grant a l loca t ion 
w i l l be d is tr ibu ted in con fo rm i ty with the IDA grant a l loca t ion guidelines, focus ing on programs that 
target pover ty such as the Educa t ion SWAp .

The triggers for the base and h igh case lending scenarios cover some o f the major areas o f the IP - 
ERS that the jo in t s t a f f assessment highlighted as needing to be improved in annual progress reports. 
They also address elements o f Kenya's country policy and institutional assessment rating that could be 
improved. The Bank would move to a low case scenario if the basic triggers fo r remaining i n the base 
case scenario are not sustained. Rather than constituting a checklist, the fo l low ing triggers are indicative 
o f broader areas o f reform and w i l l serve as a basis for judging appropriate lending levels.

IMPLEMENTING THE CAS 

A. 

Progress under the last CAS 

86. 
The September 1998 C A S was predicated o n a l o w case scenario f o r Kenya that had been brought 
about by a h is to ry o f fa i lu re in the imp lemen ta t ion o f structural re forms and a large and g row ing concern 
w i t h governance issues.’ The p r inc ipa l focus o f that C A S was economic governance, and re forms were to 
take place in the f o l l ow i n g broad areas: (a) pub l ic sector restructuring; (b) pub l ic expenditure 
management reform; and (c) strengthening o f accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms. The respons ib i l i ty o f designing 
the re fo rm program was l e f t to the government with re la t ive ly l i t t l e assistance f r om the Bank. Broad- 
based par t ic ipa t ion was seen to be the key to foster ownership and commitment, wh ich wou ld be 
re in forced through closer co l labora t ion among a l l development partners. The 1998 C A S triggers that 
w o u l d a l low Kenya t o move f r om the l o w case t o the base case scenario were c lose ly t ied to progress in 
imp rov ing economic governance. Until such tr iggers wou ld be met, l i t t le new lending wou ld be 
provided. 

87. 
Government reacted t o the 1998 C A S triggers by embark ing on the re forms requ ired t o ga in 
access t o enhanced funding. These inc luded reduc ing the number o f m in is tr ies f r om 27 to 15, 
streamlining the budget process and in t roduc ing the MTEF, and strengthening accoun tab i l i ty institutions. 
These e f for ts were underpinned by the appointment o f a team o f senior c i v i l servants-including 
the head 
o f c i v i l service, the permanent secretary, and f inanc ia l secretary in the Ministry o f Finance-who were 
charged with imp lemen t ing the re fo rm program. Based on Kenya’s performance in imp lemen t ing the 
re fo rm program, the Bank ’s Boa rd approved in 2000 the EPSRC f o r U S $ l 5 0 m i l l ion , fo l lowed b y the 
Emergency Power C red i t fo r US$72 m i l l ion , two hea l tWH IV lA IDS projects fo r a combined amount o f 
US$lOO m i l l ion , and a Reg iona l Trade Fac i l i ta t ion C red i t f o r US$25 m i l l ion . A l though the EPSRC’s f i r s t 
tranche o f ~ $ 5 0 m i l l i o n was disbursed, the former government’s fa i lure to imp lemen t po l icy re forms 
that were agreed cond i t ions t o the credit-notably, 
an t i-corrup t ion leg is la t ion -de layed the release o f the 
second tranche.

Box 3: The Bank’s knowledge strategy in Kenya 

A key feature o f the Bank‘s strategy in Kenya i s using the lending program to bu i ld understanding o f what 
strategies work best for reducing poverty; in particular via monitoring and evaluation techniques. The Ar id Lands 
Resource Management Project regularly collects data on the livelihoods and we l l being o f pastoralist families and 
information o n the financial sustainability o f pastoralist associations that are organizing services. T h e lessons 
learned from this project w i l l help inform a proposed community driven development program in the western 
regions o f Kenya. The Bank i s also working closely with a team o f academic researchers who are undertaking a 
rigorous randomized evaluation o f NGO programs i n Busia, western Kenya. T h e team has already demonstrated 
the cost effectiveness o f deworming medicine as a means o f improving school attendance. This w i l l be included 
as a component o f the education SWAP. Work i s underway also to test the impact o f girls scholarships, early 
child nutrition programs and AIDS awareness programs that hold promise for scale up. More generally the Bank 
i s trying to establish much stronger l i n k s with and between local and intemational researchers, data authorities 
and policymakers. Under the Poverty Analysis and Data Initiative (PADI), the Bank has been promoting policy- 
oriented quantitative research, intended to bu i ld capacity for poverty analysis that w i l l feed into the evaluation o f 
the PRSPs o f member countries. The Bank also supports the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), a 
not-for-profit organization devoted to advanced policy research and training. The principal objective i s to 
strengthen local capacity for conducting independent, rigorous inquiry into problems pertinent t o the management 
of economies in sub-Saharan Africa. 

World Bank Institute (WBI) activities are fu l ly integrated in the CAS. During the CAS period particular areas o f 
focus include capacity building (a) o f government through training and through mainstreaming o f the rapid results 
approach, (b) in the financial sector following the recommendations o f the Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP), (c) o f the private sector on corporate governance and business ethics; and (d) o f the public sector, 
strengthening program costing, supporting stakeholder participation in the review process, and strengthening 
parliamentary oversight o f budget formulation and execution. WBI i s also strengthening the capacity o f the 
media to contribute to the economic Dolicv debate in Kenya. 

88. 
The new government b roke the impasse o f Kenya’s relations with the Bank and other donors. 
Mo t iva ted by i t s promises fo r a b o l d an t i-corrup t ion stand, i t qu ick ly in i t ia ted a program t o fight 
corruption. These inc luded a l l the cond i t ions necessary fo r release o f the second tranche o f the EPSRC 
(US$50 m i l l ion) , and for mee t ing the 1998 CAS triggers fo r mov ing f r om a l o w t o a base case scenario. 
As a result, the Bank disbursed the second tranche o f the credit. I t also moved ahead with two new 
pover ty targeted operations, bo th o f wh ich were approved by the Boa rd on June 19,2003. These were the 
Arid Lands Resource Management Pro jec t Phase 2 f o r US$60 m i l l i o n t o support commun i ty-dr iven 
development in Kenya’s poor northeastern region, and the Free Pr imary Educa t ion Project fo r US$50 
m i l l i o n (grant), in support of the new government’s free p r ima ry education po l icy . The IFC po r t fo l io has 
declined f rom a high o f US$120 m i l l i o n to a U S $ 1 10 m i l l ion . With the general decline in investment 
flows, new IFC f inanc ing also declined. IFC did finance the compe t i t ive ly bid Tsavo power, the f i r s t 
project-financed independent powe r producer in East A f r ica . I F C also supported the g row th o f the export 
hor t icu l ture sector, promo ted the emergence o f commerc ia l m icro f inance institutions, financed new 
a ircra f t fo r the successfully p r iva t ized Kenya A irways , and in i t ia ted the p r iva t iza t ion o f Kenya Ra i lways . 

B. 

Improving portfolio implementation 

89. 
The current Kenya por t fo l io comprises 11 investment projects fo r a to ta l comm i tmen t o f US$532 
m i l l ion , with an undisbursed balance o f US$235 m i l l ion . The l o w number o f pro jec ts i s the result o f 
Kenya being in the l o w case f o r the past seven years. Seven o f these pro jec ts (64 percent o f the po r t fo l io ) 
w i l l close w i th in the nex t 18 months. Thus, the proposed lend ing p rog ram represents a new generation o f 
projects, wh ich are be ing designed on the basis o f lessons o f the past, and p rov ide a un ique oppor tun i ty to 
a l ign our program with the government’s IP-ERS. 

- 30 - 

90. 
A recurren t theme o f OED evaluations has been that development impac t and sustainability o f 
Bank pro jec ts in K e n y a i s l o w because key po l icy changes tha t were agreed as part o f the pro jec t were no t 
implemented. Moreover , the f inanc ia l sustainability o f projects was impeded either because reforms to 
ensure the f inanc ia l v iab i l i ty were no t undertaken or the pro jec t did no t receive the necessary and timely 
budgetary a l loca t ions and expenditure releases! However, we have seen a d e f i n i t e trend by Government 
to improve p o r t f o l i o performance over the last three years. Specific actions inc lude imp rov ing f l o w o f 
donor funds in special accounts b y b r ing ing these accounts onshore and, more specifically, under the 
con t ro l o f the p ro jec t imp lemen t ing en t i t ies ; imp rov ing e f f ic iency in payment processing, and enhancing 
j o i n t government Bank po r t fo l io mon i tor ing . As a result o f these initiatives, the disbursement ra t io 
increased f r om 12 percent in f isca l 1998 to 24 percent in f isca l 2003. The share o f prob lem projects 
decreased f r om 43 percent in f isca l 1998 t o 27 percent in f isca l 2004, while the share o f projects at risk 
declined f r om 79 percent in f isca l 1998 to 45 percent in f isca l 2004, A c t i o n plans have been developed 
for the f i v e pro jec ts at risk, three o f wh ich w i l l close by the end o f f isca l 2004. 

9 1. 

M o r e recently, the government demonstrated i t s comm i tmen t t o imp rov ing po r t fo l io performance 
during the CPPR tha t was he ld in January 2004-the 
f i rs t CPPR to be he ld since 1997. The CPPR 
reached agreement on several key issues, inc lud ing using pr iva te auditors, strengthening pro jec t 
management units through compe t i t ive selection fo r c i v i l servant pro jec t coordinators, a l low ing funds to 
flow d i rec t ly f r om Treasury t o projects, and establishing a mechanism f o r the d irec t involvement o f high 
l e v e l o f f ic ia ls within l i n e m in is tr ies overseeing pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion in order to ensure accountability. 
The CPPR ac t ion p l a n that was developed w i l l be mon i tored by the CPPR comm i t tee who w i l l report on a 
quarterly basis t o government permanent secretaries. 

92. 
Thus, during the C A S period, the strategic thrust o f po r t fo l io improvemen t w i l l include: (a) risk 
m i t iga t ion , especially with respect t o high risk, high impac t operations and cross-cutting systemic risks; 
(b) satisfactory imp lemen ta t ion o f the CPPR agreed actions, focus ing o n results and impact; and (c) 
continuous improvemen t o f OED ratings b y focus ing attention on operations reaching ma tu r i ty that w i l l 
be completed during the C A S pe r iod to ensure that results are achieved and mechanisms are in place to 
ensure sustainability. CPPRs w i l l be he ld annually t o strengthen the linkages o f the ongo ing po r t fo l io 
with the coun try program, with par t icu lar emphasis o n M&E t o ensure an imp roved and sustained leve l o f 
po r t fo l io performance.

Partnerships 

93 * 
Partnerships between the Bank and o f f i c i a l mu l t i la te ra l and b i la te ra l development agencies are 
excellent in Kenya . The Bank Group’s wo rk ing relations with other donors i s re ferred t o in the 
presentation o f the C A S lend ing program above. Impor tan t ly , the Bank Group’s co l labora t ion with the 
two nex t largest donors after itself-the EU and DFID-has been evo lv ing in to several co f inanc ing and 
other collaborative undertakings. Re la t ions with other donor agencies are also excellent. The Bank 
chairs the Dono r Coo rd ina t ion G roup f o r Kenya, wh ich i s the ma in f o r um f o r the dialogue on donor 
harmonization, alignment, and coordination. Kenya i s a signatory o f the Rome agreement on donor 
harmonization, and the Bank i s tak ing a lead ro le in imp rov ing coord ina t ion at b o t h the general and 
sectoral leve l . The Bank organ ized and co-chaired with the government the Consultative Group meeting 
he ld in Na irob i , Novembe r 24-25,2003. One o f the fou r ma jo r themes o f the mee t ing was donor 
coordination against a background of many years under the prev ious government when the ab i l i ty t o 
coordinate was underm ined by the reduc t ion o r w i thd rawa l o f many donor programs. The government 
agreed to convene meetings with the donors every t w o months, t o discuss and reach agreement on 

A meeting o f the Informal Subcommittee o f the Committee on Development Effectiveness was held on 
December 8,2003 to discuss the 2001 Country Assistance Evaluation prepared by OED, and a note on recent 
developments.

The decision to qu ick ly scale up Bank G roup assistance t o Kenya carries r isks , and it i s 
developing specific measures t o guard against these. Spec i f ic r i s k s include: 

9 5 . 

Po l i t ica l economy. A par t icu lar concern i s tha t the requ ired consensus t o move fo rwa rd with 
po l i t ica l ly d i f f i c u l t re forms w i l l be d i f f i c u l t t o reach. Ano ther po ten t ia l risk i s o f “capture” o f key po l icy 
areas by interest and pressure groups. C r i t ica l re forms o f government and parastatal ins t i tu t ions can be ‘ 
delayed or en t ire ly derailed by those with a stake in the status quo. Trade p o l i c y re forms cou ld be 
b locked b y pro tec t ion is t interests. The Bank G roup w i l l address these r i s k s by imp rov ing and expanding 
i t s e f for ts at communications, emphas iz ing the costs o f con t inu ing with the economic status quo, the Iong- 

 
 
- 32 - 

te rm b e n e f i t s o f reforms, the bene f i ts t o the poor o f a more equitable pa t tern o f pub l ic expenditure, and 
oppor tun i t ies f o r accelerating g row th through greater pr iva te sector invo lvemen t in infrastructure. B e t t e r 
dissemination o f E S W w i l l be an impor tan t vehicle o f this enhanced communications effort, bu t it w i l l 
also invo lve proac t ive efforts, with assistance f rom the A f r i c a Reg ion Ex terna l A f fa i rs and Partnerships 
G roup and f r om WB I to reach ou t t o parliamentarians, the pr iva te sector, c i v i l society, academics and o f 
course the media. T o t h e extent feasible this e f fo r t w i l l be undertaken in co l labora t ion with other donors. 

96 . 

Capacig. There i s an urgent need to rebu i ld Kenya’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity, and fa i lure to do so 
constitutes a ma jo r area o f risk. Kenya i s a paradox in that it has a large number o f highly trained and 
experienced c i v i l servants, yet i t s ins t i tu t ions rema in weak f o l l ow i n g years o f mismanagement and poor 
incentives f o r performance. In addition, the fragmentation o f decision mak ing and lack o f 
commun ica t ion between government m in is tr ies and departments can lead to considerable delays in po l icy 
formu la t ion and program implementation. The G loba l Development Lea rn ing N e tw o r k Learn ing and 
Innova t ion L o a n i s he lp ing t o develop mechanisms o f commun ica t ion among p o l i c y makers. W i t h 
assistance f r om WBI, and through projects, training, and analysis support w i l l be p rov ided to build bo th 
human and ins t i tu t iona l capacity. The Bank’s dialogue w i l l emphasize support fo r strengthened inter- 
m in is te r ia l coord ina t ion in the PER and MTEF process, encouraging stronger p lann ing o f finance 
functions, and the need fo r strong co l labora t ion in the process o f imp lemen t ing sectoral operations 
der ived f r om t h e IP-ERS as an incen t ive fo r p romo t ing ample and coordinated donor support. 

97 . 

Governance. Any fa i lu re to change past patterns o f corrup t ion and “capture” o f the s ta te 
apparatus by entrenched and powe r fu l interests wou ld dera i l the development process and diminish 
Kenya’s external c red ib i l i ty . In addition, an inher i ted culture o f poor governance and o f top down m ic ro 
management on the par t o f senior o f f ic ia ls cou ld lead to poor execu t ion o f agreed policies, T o counter 
this risk, the Bank w i l l s tr ive t o strengthen government f iduc ia ry safeguards and practices. The Bank w i l l 
fo l low through on actions iden t i f ied in the course o f the C F A A and C P A R w o r k t o be carr ied out in f isca l 
2005, focusing on the ins ta l la t ion o f ins t i tu t iona l safeguards against abuse, but also on bu i ld ing the 
capacity (mak ing use o f the PSAC scheduled fo r f isca l 2005) to ensure tha t basic f iduc ia ry measures are 
carried out. The Bank w i l l ensure that an t i-corrup t ion safeguards are incorpora ted within Bank-supported 
projects during the preparation phase, and the Department o f Ins t i tu t iona l In teg r i ty w i l l be invo lved as 
par t o f pro jec t teams du r ing their i n i t i a l phases. Mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion w i l l be a feature o f the Bank’s 
program bo th at the general level, and at the leve l o f ind iv idua l Bank-supported operations. The Bank has 
supported the development o f a result-based and mon i torab le f ramewo rk f o r the IP-ERS, f rom wh ich the 
CAS ’S ow n result-based framework i s drawn. In addition, a l l e f for ts w i l l be made t o incorporate 
widespread pub l ic understanding of, and par t ic ipa t ion in, the mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f results within 
the frameworks o f bo th the IP -ERS and this CAS, as agreed during C A S consu l ta t ion with c i v i l society 
and the pr iva te sector. 

98 . 

External factors. Terms o f trade shifts, par t icu lar ly co f fee and tea, con t inue t o a f fec t ru ra l 
incomes and Kenya’s balance o f trade. In terna t iona l terror ism has seriously hampered recovery o f 
tourism, and in terna t iona l perceptions cou ld continue to hamper b o t h tou r ism and investment. The 
weather, par t icu lar ly the a l tema t ing cycles o f f loods and drought, con t inue t o a f fec t agr icu l tura l 
production. Ma rke t in tegra t ion poses f isca l r i s k s and puts add i t iona l pressure on f i r m s in prev ious ly 
protected industries. Non renewa l o f the AGOA, wh ich has underp inned the expansion o f exports and 
related employment in the Kenyan garment industry, also poses a risk t o the v iab i l i ty o f the garment 
sector in Kenya. A l though AGOA w i l l no t expire until 2008 , at the end o f 2004 countries w i l l have to 
use US or A f r ican c lo th t o q u a l i f y f o r preferences under AGOA. T o address these r isks , the Bank w i l l 
complement the e f for ts o f other donors focus ing on security issues by inves t ing in improvements t o the 
airport and po r t o f Mombasa tha t inc lude security upgrades in l ine with in terna t iona l standards. In order 
to offset revenue declines associated with trade and commod i ty-re la ted shocks, the Bank wou ld p lan fo r

Mon i to r ing t h e Bank’s effectiveness w i l l take place both at the project level and at the level o f the

benchmarks reflect the selective areas o f Bank involvement under the CAS, cover the key challenges that 
Kenya must address and for which the Bank i s best placed to assist, and are achievable within the CAS 
timeframe. At the midpoint of the CAS period, the Bank w i l l review the indicators and targets to assess 
progress in implementing the assistance program, and adjust the Bank’s strategy as necessary,

REPUBLIC OF K E N Y A 
CAS CONSULTATIONS 

The W o r l d Bank ’s program in Kenya has h is tor ica l ly been highly consultative. The previous CAS 
(1998) invo lved extensive consultations with c i v i l society, and t h e Bank also closely fo l lowed the 
par t ic ipa tory process organized by the government around the fo rmu la t ion o f the PRSP in 2001-2002. 
The Bank has a full-time Soc ia l Deve lopmen t Specialist at i t s N a i r o b i office, who liaises regu lar ly 
with c i v i l society. V i r tua l ly a l l projects that have been prepared over recent years, inc lud ing the 
current pipeline, have undertaken s ign i f ican t consultations with beneficiaries, stakeholders and 
government. As a consequence, ove ra l l relations and communications with NGOs and communities 
are very good. The previous C A S consultations were carried ou t in a con tex t where po l i t ica l w i l l to 
imp lemen t re forms was l im i ted . F o r the present CAS, the Bank has sought t o build upon the existing 
good leve l o f commun ica t ion with NGOs, while extending the dialogue t o the pr iva te sector and the 
new parliament. Impor tan t ly , t h e Bank has sought to build a high degree o f dialogue, understanding 
and ownership around the C A S with the government at bo th the technical and higher levels. 

Discussions with a l l these d i f fe ren t groups took place at the f o l l ow i n g occasions, and focused on the 
f o l l ow i n g issues: 

Government. The Bank launched i t s discussions with government at the techn ica l leve l with a W B I - 
fac i l i ta ted workshop in Na i rob i , January 15-16,2004. This focused on the applications o f “Rapid 
Resu l ts” me thodo logy t o he lp p r io r i t ize and operationalize the IP-ERS, f o l l ow e d by discussion o f the 
objectives o f the Bank’s C A S and h ow i t s o w n r e s u l t s ma t r ix a l igned with the IP-ERS. This 
workshop, wh ich was organized by the Ministry o f Planning, invo lved 150 d i f fe ren t government 
officials 
representing a l l l i n e ministries with a stake in development operations, and inc luded the 
ac t ive par t ic ipa t ion o f several Permanent Secretaries as w e l l as representatives o f donor organizations. 
The workshop succeeded in deve lop ing a much more highly p r io r i t ized IP-ERS tha t i s l inked t o the 
na t iona l budget, and wh ich has been used as the basis fo r f ina l iza t ion o f the IP-ERS . I t also 
introduced this core group o f m id - leve l techn ica l o f f ic ia ls f r om within government t o the C A S and 
h ow i t s results or ien ta t ion connects t o their o w n strategy document. 

The CPPR he ld January 26,2004 also constituted a par t o f the Bank’s outreach t o government on the 
CAS , In th is event, attended by several ministers and permanent secretaries, the Bank discussed in 
de ta i l w i t h the representatives o f k e y l i n e m in is tr ies problems w i t h imp lemen ta t ion o f the por t fo l io , 
and the Bank communicated the importance o f imp lemen ta t ion in ensuring con t inued access t o IDA 
funding. The r i c h discussion led t o agreement on an ac t ion p lan fo r im p r o v i n g imp lemen ta t ion and 
assignment o f accountabilities within government fo r seeing the p lan through . 

On January 20,2004, the Bank organized a mee t ing w i t h several key m in is ters and permanent 
secretaries to rev iew the CAS, in par t icu lar the lend ing p rog ram and tr iggers as well as specific resu l ts 
to be achieved in support o f IP-ERS goals. At this time, the Bank also presented the coun try po l icy 
and ins t i tu t iona l assessment ra t ings f o r Kenya, and l inked them t o the C A S process v i a the need to 
improve certain outcomes as reflected in triggers. The government o f f ic ia ls present endorsed the CAS 
program and approach, and p rov ided use fu l feedback on spec i f ic areas o f the CAS, inc lud ing the need 
to reinforce i t s coverage on the env ironmen t and on loca l government in the con tex t o f 
decentralization.

Parliament. A breakfast meeting w i th the Parliament’s Budget and Finance Committee was held on 
21 January 2004. The Bank presented i t s CAS lending and Nonlending program, and as the topic was 
new to most Parliamentarians, provided a briefing on the Bank’s genera1 approach and goals in Kenya, 
The discussion focused on issues relating to the need to improve trade and the environment for the 
private sector, fiscal management and stability, and managing internal debt. In addition, a good part o f 
the discussion focused on building routine communications links w i th parliament in order to establish 
a more regular dialogue, provide information on the Bank and general development issues, and clarify 
possible areas o f misunderstanding. I t was agreed that the Bank w i l l coordinate with W B I in 
establishing a schedule o f presentations and meetings. 

Private sector. The Bank has forged a reinvigorated relationship w i th the private sector, which has 
been greatly facilitated by t h e unification o f several previously competing private sector associations 
w i th in the Private Sector Alliance, which the government recognizes as i t s principal interlocutor for 
purposes o f i t s own dialogue w i th the business and investor community. Representatives o f the 
private sector participated fully in the Bank-PPIAF organized conference in May 2003 on private 
sector participation in infrastructure (discussed in the CAS section on private sector development). In 
July 2003, a number of key representatives o f the business community met w i th Mr. Wolfensohn 
during his v is i t to Kenya. I n the context o f the CAS, t h e Private Sector Alliance met w i th t h e Bank 
Group, including i t s Bank-IFC-PPIAF private sector development team, and discussed t h e Bank’s 
CAS strategy for private sector-led growth, including a presentation by the Bank o f i t s investment 
climate assessment for Kenya. Among key issues o f concern discussed were the low access to credit 
particularly by small entrepreneurs, the need for the government to move ahead quickly w i th i t s 
agenda for privatization and for improving the investment climate, and the need for the Bank to 
support small and medium enterprises w i th their capacity and access to business services, A key area 
o f discussion was the regularization o f the dialogue that has started so promisingly w i th the Bank, and 
agreement was reached on a schedule o f monthly meetings around specific agenda items. 

C iv i l Society, NGOs, and community organizations. As noted above, the Bank’s interactions w i th c iv i l 
society have occurred on a continuous basis for an extended period o f time. C i v i l society and 
communities are regularly consulted in the course o f project preparation and implementation. A key 
challenge, which has been discussed on several occasions w i th NGOs i s to involve them more fu l ly in 
participatory monitoring and evaluation, and an ID F grant i s being deployed in specific application to 
this objective. W i th regard to the CAS the following meetings were held in the course o f CAS 
formulation to discuss i t s content:

Meeting w i th Western Kenya NGO Coalition, Kisumu, January 19,2004

Follow-up workshops w i th NGOs in Nairobi and Kisumu focusing on capacity-building needs 
o f NGOs, led by WBI, April 2004. 

Each o f these meetings contained significant representation from women’s organizations. Several 
major areas were discussed in depth on these occasions: 

The Bank’s support for improving government capacity: CSOs were particularly concerned that the 

Bank have in place support mechanisms that addressed the government’s presen t low capacity in 
budget and expenditure management, as we l l as in te rms o f project implementation. A n important 
aspect o f this capacity i s that o f communications w i th c i v i l society and communities, which i s

cu r ren t ly lack ing , mak ing it d i f f i c u l t fo r these organizations t o make their con tr ibu t ion to 
development. 

Capacity bu i ld ing for c iv i l society organizations. These organizations are eager to p l a y a ma jor ro le in 
development, but o f ten lack adequate capacity. They see an important ro le f o r the Bank in supporting 
this capacity. 

A r t icu la t ion between the P M P and IP-ERS. CSOs had considered themselves very w e l l consulted in 
the ear l ier PRSP process, but were concerned that they had no t had adequate oppor tun i ty to interact 
with government in the PRSP’s re formu la t ion in the f o rm o f the IP-ERS. They therefore did no t f e e l 
as high a degree o f ownership in this document, and expressed concern about whether they had a 
s ign i f ican t ro le t o p lay in i t s implementation. 

F inanc ia l services to the poo r . CSOs were un iversa l ly concerned about the lack o f f inanc ia l services 
pa r t icu la r ly to the poor, and fully endorsed the Bank’s comm i tmen t to support re fo rm o f the f inanc ia l 
sector, urging o n l y that there be a genuine focus in i t s operations on increasing the access o f the poor, 
and women in particular. 

Reversing inequities andfocusing on the needs of vulnerable populations. CSOs approved o f the 

Bank ’s focus o n iden t i fy ing and addressing inequities, fo r example v i a the pover ty mapp ing exercise, 
and on targe t ing i t s interventions in infrastructure par t icu lar ly t o the poorest populations. They 
emphasized in par t icu lar the need to address issues o f concern to women and you th as key populations 
wh ich are highly marg ina l ized in the delivery o f basic services. 

H I V A I D S . CSOs endorsed the Bank ’s con t inu ing comm i tmen t to help Kenya battle HIVlAIDS and 
pa r t icu la r ly approved o f the way in w h i c h the Bank has sought t o imp lemen t i t s MAP in Kenya 
through CSOs engaged in t h e fight against the disease. They stressed that in a second phase, even 
greater e f fo r t shou ld be made t o focus on women. 

C o ~ ~ u n i t y - d r i v e n development. CSOs endorsed the C D D approach, in w h i c h many have 
participated, and urged the Bank t o expand i t s w o r k in this area, wh i le extending i t s capac i ty-bu i ld ing 
e f for ts to NGOs t o ensure they are able t o p lay a produc t ive role. 

Decentralization. CSOs po in ted t o the importance o f the present cons t i tu t iona l debate over the degree 
o f devo lu t ion o f powers, and urged the Bank to support the decentralization process, with an emphasis 
on building loca l government capacity, as w e l l as that o f community-based CSOs so they can help in 
the process. 

The Bank’s results-based approach. CSOs fully approved o f the Bank ’s r e s u l t s or ien ta t ion and 
expressed high in te res t in pa r t ic ipa t ing in mon i to r ing and evaluation o f outcomes. In this regard, they 
also articulated their interest in the government’s prev ious outreach t o them so l ic i t ing the i r 
invo lvemen t in par t ic ipa tory M&E around the IP-ERS. They expressed some disappointment, 
however, in that th is seems t o have slipped f r om the government’s agenda, and asked tha t the Bank 
take this up as a p r io r i ty top ic t o be resolved. 

Ongoing consultations: NGO leaders expressed their appreciation f o r the Bank ’s comm i tmen t t o 
inc lud ing them in ma jor development forum, inc lud ing hav ing NGO leaders attend the Consultative 
Group mee t ing on 24-25 November, 2003. They requested a deepening o f this f o rm o f consultation 
and inc lus ion at a l l possible oppor tun i t ies where they might present c i v i l society’s v iews o n key 
development issues .
