Execut ive Summary 

This Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) i s be ing prepared at a d i f f i c u l t and uncertain 
time f o r B o l i v i a . There has been an escalating t rend o f social unrest-with 
serious con f l ic ts in 
Apr i l 2000, September/October 2000, January 2002, and February 2003. These con f l ic ts 
cu lm ina ted in the fo rced resignation o f President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003 
and the assumption (in accordance w i t h cons t i tu t iona l processes) o f V i c e President Carlos Mesa 
as President. 

C u r r e n t S i tua t ion 

B o l i v i a ’ s current situation i s the result o f the vo la t i le confluence o f three trends- 
economic, po l i t ica l , and social-that have been building up over several years. On the economic 
side, three features stand out-a 
lack o f progress in pove r ty reduc t ion and high inequa l i ty , a 
vu lne rab i l i ty o f the economy t o external shocks, and a precarious f isca l situation. 
O n the p o l i t i c a l side, there has been a g r ow i n g disenchantment w i t h the ove r t use o f 
p o l i t i c a l patronage and the tolerance, i f n o t actual support, o f corruption, o n the part o f the 
t rad i t iona l p o l i t i c a l parties. With the recent change in administration, this disenchantment gave 
way t o a to ta l re jec t ion o f the t rad i t iona l parties, and the Mesa cabinet was fo rmed ou t o f 
independent members. The last several years have also witnessed the r ise o f new p o l i t i c a l parties 
closely a l igned w i t h indigenous groups. Ne i the r the government n o r the partners that w o r k w i t h 
the government can a f fo rd t o igno re the new voices. The challenge w i l l be t o incorporate a 
mu l t icu l tu ra l perspective in a way that does n o t cu t o f f the poo r and indigenous people f r o m the 
economic opportunities o f fe red b y economic in teg ra t ion w i t h the outside wo r ld . 
O n the social side, there i s an increasing impatience w i t h the levels o f inequa l i ty , 
pa r t icu la r ly in l a n d d is t r ibu t ion . Indigenous groups fee l that they have rece ived l i t t l e f r o m the 
exp lo i ta t ion o f natural resources in the past-silver 
and tin. These deep suspicions, plus 
suspicions o f the cap i ta l iza t ion process, f e d oppos i t ion t o the natural gas expo r t project. General 
discontent was also f e d b y lack o f progress in income-related measures o f pove r ty . There has 
been progress in social indicators, but i t has been uneven and has n o t been pe rce ived b y 
disaffected groups as enough. 

Gove rnmen t Strategy 

The government o f President Mesa that took over in a cons t i tu t iona l t rans i t ion on 
October 17, 2003 f o l l ow i n g the fo rced resignation o f Gonza lo Sanchez de Lozada has m o v e d 
q u i c k l y t o fo rmu la te i t s plans. The plans have been fo rmu la ted t o cover t w o periods: (a) a first 
phase-from 
the present t o the planned comp le t ion o f a Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly (expected t o 
take between 14 and 18 months), and (b) a second phase-from 
the end o f the Cons t i tu t iona l 
Assembly t o the end o f the cons t i tu t iona l t e r m o f the President (that i s , until August 6, 2007). 
During the first phase, the government w i l l be pu rsu ing the f o l l ow i n g three p o l i t i c a l 
objectives: 
0 Rev is ing the hydrocarbons law ; 
Submitting the decision t o export na tu ra l gas t o a p u b l i c referendum; 
C a l l i n g f o r a Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly t o m o d i f y the ex is t ing Constitution.

In add i t ion t o the three p o l i t i c a l objectives, the government w i l l be attempting to achieve the 
f o l l ow i n g three economic objectives: 
Res to r ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty 
Reo r ien t ing some pub l ic expenditure towa rd h igh -v is ib i l i ty programs that respond t o 
unde r ly ing factors that l e d t o social con f l ic t , especially in sensitive geographical areas 
Relaunching the ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm p rog ram and a n t i c om p t i o n e f fo r ts . 
The second phase o f the Mesa administration w o u l d begin once the Constitutional 
Assembly ends. B y the beg inn ing o f the second phase, the government w o u l d hope t o have: (i) 
passed the po ten t ia l ly d iv is ive processes o f the gas referendum and the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly 
w i t h su f f ic ien t in te rna l cohesion t o ma in ta in social peace and t o move f o rw a r d t o solve problems 
o f inequa l i ty , exclusion and poverty; (ii) fo rmu la ted a revised Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy, 
hav ing passed a pe r iod o f consultation w i t h c i v i l society; (iii) instituted a f isca l pact, where c i v i l 
society w o u l d recognize the d i f f i c u l t f isca l situation and w o u l d be agreeable t o measures 
designed t o raise revenue in a progressive way and t o moderate g r ow t h in expenditure, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the wage bill; and ( iv ) adjusted the p o r t f o l i o o f in te rna t iona l assistance so as t o 
make past reforms f inanc ia l ly sustainable and so as t o be aligned w i t h the rev ised Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP). 
The government w i l l move re la t ive ly q u i c k l y t o s t a r t rev is ing the PRSP that was 
rev iewed by the B o a r d in June 2001. This rev is ion w i l l place greater emphasis o n increasing 
income opportunities f o r the poo r and ach iev ing M i l l e n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs). A new 
process o f Na t iona l D ia logue in support o f the rev is ion i s already underway. 

IDA/IBRD Strategy 

G i v e n the pa r t icu la r circumstances in B o l i v i a , t o be e f fec t ive the W o r l d B a n k (WB) 
cannot adopt a business-as-usual approach. N o t a l l the expected elements f o r preparing a 
Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) in an In te rna t iona l Development Assoc ia t ion (IDA) coun t ry 
are in place. F o r example, i t w i l l be imposs ib le t o have a Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) w i t h adequate consultation f o r many months. In the meantime, there are c r i t ica l areas 
where government needs t o move f o rw a r d and needs W o r l d B a n k he lp t o d o so. 
B a n k management proposes a strong package o f f inanc ia l assistance and rap id ly 
delivered technical assistance t o be inc luded under the C A S that w o u l d cove r t w o years, F Y 0 4 
and FY05 . The re la t ive ly short pe r iod t o be covered by this C A S i s due t o the uncertainty that i s 
generated by the p lan t o h o l d a Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly over the nex t 18 months. 
The proposed f inanc ia l resources t o be p rov ided t o B o l i v i a are up t o US$lOO m i l l i o n a 
year in the base case scenario, up t o U S $ l 5 0 m i l l i o n a year in the high case scenario, and 
approximately US$45 m i l l i o n a year in the l o w case scenario. The proposed leve l o f assistance 
in the base case w o u l d be su f f ic ien t t o support an average o f fou r projects and fou r pieces o f 
Econom ic and Sector W o r k (ESW) pe r year during 2004-05. The compos i t ion o f the lend ing 
p rog ram w o u l d be 50 percent adjustment and 5 0 percent investment lend ing . 
Because Bo l iv ia ’s gross na t iona l income (GNI) per capita i s p ro jec ted t o f a l l be low the 
In te rna t iona l Development Agency (IDA) c u t o f f and t o rema in be low that c u t o f f f o r several 
years, B a n k management proposes t o delay graduation o f B o l i v i a f r o m IDA , and f o r B o l i v i a to 

11 

rema in a b lend coun t ry through the end o f the I D A 14 cycle. In the l o w case scenario, B o l i v i a 
w o u l d be p rov ided access o n l y t o IDA , w h i l e in bo th the base and high case scenarios B o l i v i a 
w o u l d receive a b l e n d o f IDA and IBRD resources. 
This support w o u l d be aligned closely w i t h the government’s program. There are 15 
projects in the ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o that are at d i f fe ren t stages o f implementation. The o r ig ina l 
amount o f these credits was US$592.2 m i l l i o n , and as o f Novembe r 24, 2003 there remained an 
undisbursed balance o f US$286.6 m i l l i o n . 
Three p ro jec ts are proposed f o r FY04 . T w o projects, the Emergency Econom ic Recovery 
C red i t (US$14 M i l l i o n IDA) and the First Programmatic B a n k and Corporate Sector 
Restructuring P ro jec t (US$15 M i l l i o n IDA and US$15 M i l l i o n IBRD), w o u l d respond t o the 
problems o f ma in ta in ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . One project, the Soc ia l Sector Programmatic 
C red i t (US$20 M i l l i o n IDA), w o u l d he lp ma in ta in progress in health, education and water and 
sanitation and w o u l d accelerate progress towards MDGs by reduc ing disparities in outcomes 
across d i f fe ren t regions, ethnic groups and income classes. 
F i v e projects are proposed f o r FY 0 5 . T w o projects, the L a n d R e f o rm Project and the 
Spatial R u r a l Development/Community-driven Deve lopmen t Project, respond d i rec t ly t o the 
problems o f inequa l i ty and t o the problems that the poo r have in generating income. One 
project, the possible Second Programmatic B a n k and Corporate Res t ruc tu r ing L o a n o r the F isca l 
Adjustment Loan , responds t o problems o f ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability. One project, 
the Second Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm Project, w o u l d he lp the government re launch i t s ins t i tu t iona l 
re fo rm and an t i -co r rup t ion programs, one o f the current high p r io r i t ies . The fifth project, the 
Secondary Educa t ion Project, does n o t respond t o an immed ia te short-term p r io r i ty , but i s 
necessary and impo r tan t t o a l l ow the coun t ry t o continue with i t s successful ongoing Educa t ion 
R e f o rm program. The Educa t ion R e f o rm i s one o f the few government programs that cou ld be 
considered truly a state po l icy , as i t has been supported across several d i f fe ren t administrations. 
In add i t ion t o these projects, Econom ic and Sector W o r k proposed f o r F Y 0 4 w o u l d 
consist o f a Pub l ic Expend i tu re Rev iew (PER), a Coun t ry F inanc ia l and Accoun tab i l i ty 
Assessment (CFAA ) , a Pove r ty Assessment, an Educa t ion Sector S tudy and a Pove r ty and Soc ia l 
Impac t Analysis. T h e proposed E S W p rog ram f o r F Y 0 5 w o u l d concentrate o n issues related t o 
growth, especially the problems faced b y the poo r in generating income . The ma jo r piece o f 
E SW w o u l d be a Coun t ry Econom ic Memo randum (CEM ) focus ing o n g row th recovery and 
trade. G iven that such a high percentage o f the economy in B o l i v i a i s in fo rma l , the C E M w o u l d 
be complemented by a labo r and i n f o rm a l ma rke t study. Other pieces o f ESW f o r F Y 0 5 inc lude 
a study o n con f l ic t analysis and reso lu t ion and an analysis o f B o l i v i a ’ s Social Protection 
Framework.

In the nex t CAS program, there w i l l be a concerted e f fo r t t o increase the focus o f W o r l d 
B a n k Ins t i tu te (WBI) programs compared t o h ow the p rog ram was managed in the past. I t i s 
expected that 80 percent o f the WB I p rog ram w o u l d be focused o n the f o l l ow i n g fou r p r i o r i t y

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) i s being prepared at a d i f f i c u l t and uncertain 
t im e f o r Bo l iv ia . There has been an escalating trend o f social unrest-with 
serious con f l ic ts in 
April 2000, September/October 2000, January 2002, and February 2003. These con f l ic ts 
cu lm ina ted in the fo rced resignation o f President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003 
and the assumption (in accordance w i t h constitutional processes) o f V i c e President Carlos Mesa 
as President. H e faces numerous challenges in t r y i n g t o resolve the country’s economic, 
po l i t ica l , and social problems, and the way fo rwa rd i s n o t en t i re ly clear. 
2 . 
The typ ica l approach t o uncertainty o f back load ing support i s n o t appropriate at this 
decisive momen t in B o l i v i a ’ s h is to ry . There are r i s k s in B o l i v i a , but these r i s k s w i l l be h ighe r i f 
the W o r l d B a n k does n o t rema in ac t ive ly engaged. However, f o r the W o r l d B a n k t o be effective, 
i t w i l l be necessary t o adapt t o the d i f f i c u l t circumstances. N o t a l l the expected elements f o r 
preparing a C A S in an In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t Association (IDA) coun t ry are in place, and 
the W o r l d B a n k cannot adopt a business-as-usual approach. F o r example, i t w i l l be imposs ib le 
t o have a Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) w i t h adequate consultation f o r many months. 
In the meantime, there are c r i t i c a l areas where government needs t o m o v e fo rwa rd and needs 
W o r l d B a n k help t o do so. 
3. 
B a n k management proposes a strong package o f f inanc ia l assistance and rap id ly 
de l ive red technical assistance t o be de l ive red under a C A S that w o u l d cover t w o years, F Y 0 4 and 
FY 0 5 . This support w o u l d be a l igned closely w i t h the government’s p rog ram and, together w i t h 
the continued imp lemen ta t ion o f the ex is t ing po r t fo l io , the new programs w o u l d he lp the coun t ry 
address problems o f exclusion, inequality, pove r ty and f isca l imbalance. The re la t ive ly short 
pe r iod t o be covered by this C A S i s due t o the uncertainty that i s generated by the p l a n t o h o l d a 
Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly over the nex t 18 months. The exact date i s u n k n ow n at this time. 
W h i l e the changes com ing ou t o f the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly c o u l d be pos i t ive o r poss ib ly 
negative and m ino r , once the Assemb ly i s convened i t w o u l d have the powe r t o change any th ing 
in the Constitution. 
4. 
A new C A S w o u l d be prepared t o cover F Y 0 6 and beyond, when i t i s l i k e l y that the 
outcome o f the Cons t i tu t iona l Assemb ly w o u l d be known . P rov ided there i s a v iab le economic, 
po l i t ica l , and social arena in w h i c h the B a n k can be effective, the B a n k w o u l d be prepared t o 
w o r k o n a comprehensive p rog ram that w o u l d inc lude fu r the r in i t ia t ives t o address inequa l i ty 
and lack o f income generation f o r the poor. I f i t proves ex t reme ly d i f f i c u l t t o operate, the B a n k 
w o u l d limit i t s activities t o basic investments in infrastructure and the social sectors.

Pove r ty outcomes have also been ve ry uneven-with 
s ign i f ican t differences across 
d iv is ions o f ru ra lh rban , h igh land low land , and ind igenoushon ind igenous groups. The lack o f 
significant progress in pove r ty reduction, the l o w leve l o f p r iva te domestic investment (less than 
1 percent o f GDP in 2002), the stagnation o f exports over the last 20 years (although the 
compos i t ion has changed), and continued high levels o f i n f o rm a l i t y have l e d t o increasing 
questioning o f the a b i l i t y o f the “economic mode l ” t o de l ive r the goods. 
8. 
B o l i v i a ’ s i n a b i l i t y t o make mo re r a p i d and sustained progress in pove r ty reduc t ion i s due, 
in part, t o the economy be ing bu f fe ted by shocks-both pos i t ive and negative and b o t h external 
and internal. High g row th in the 1990s was sparked by pos i t ive external shocks that l e d t o the 
expansion o f service sectors and exports. I n a pattern typ ica l o f pos i t ive shocks, there f o l l ow e d a 
bank credit boom, a shift in re la t ive prices favo r ing the nontradable sector, and increases in tax 
revenue w i t h attendant increases in government expenditure. In te rna t iona l reserves c l imbed and 
the p r ima ry f isca l balance be fo re pensions reached 2.5 percent o f GDP. At the end o f 1997, 
there were expectations o f sustained high g row th f o r the entire L a t i n Ame r ican region, inc lud ing 
B o l i v i a . 
9. 
Un fo r tuna te ly , the good times did n o t last and the pos i t ive shocks o f the ea r ly and m i d - 
1990s were f o l l ow e d by negative shocks in the late 1990s. As a result o f the international capital 
market crisis o f the late 1990s, there was a sudden d rop in external financing, lead ing t o a 
reduc t ion in g row th in the entire L a t i n Ame r ican region. B o l i v i a suffered along w i t h other 
countries.

demand f o r B o l i v i a n goods and l ow e r levels o f remittances, p r inc ipa l ly f r o m B o l i v i a n workers in 
Argentina. 
The B raz i l ian and Argentine devaluations d rama t ica l ly affected Bo l iv ia ’s

competitiveness. O n the domestic side, a 70-percent drop in coca p roduc t ion between 1998 and 
2002, w h i l e an impo r tan t advance f o r the coun t ry as a whole, did reduce incomes. These shocks 
were o n l y p a r t l y compensated f o r b y the exp lo i ta t ion o f new gas reserves. The net resu l t o f these 
shocks put considerable strain o n the corporate and bank ing sectors. Moreover, the accelerated 
depreciation needed t o ma in ta in competitiveness in the face o f B raz i l ian and A rgen t in ian 
devaluations did have the effect o f increasing debt service burdens since v i r t u a l l y a l l lend ing i s 
dollarized. As the s lowdown in g row th occurred, the response o f the government and p r iva te 
banks t o strengthen the f inanc ia l sector l e d t o a c red i t crunch.' The ove ra l l lend ing p o r t f o l i o 
shrank (as the banks adjusted t o the less-promising investment climate) and the share o f 
nonpe r fo rm ing loans increased (see F igu re 1).

These shocks and the resu l t ing s lowdown in g r ow t h l e d t o drops in pe r capita income (see 
Tab le 2), increases in poverty, and pressure o n the f isca l balance. 

1 D u r i n g 1995-2000 the Superintendencia de Buncos y Entidades Financieras (SBEF) passed several impor tan t 
new regulations, aimed at strengthening banks and enhancing supervision. The most salient o f them inc luded 
new capital rules, as a result o f wh ich bank cap i ta l more than doub led dur ing 1995-2000, f r om U S $ 2 3 5 m i l l i o n

the late 199Os, when banks stopped bo r row ing abroad and the economy started to decelerate, lead ing b o t h to 
scarce bank l iqu id i ty .

There has been some negative feedback f r o m p o l i t i c a l and social events t o the economic 
situation. The social con f l ic ts o f October 2003 m a y have persistent negative effects on the 
economic prospects f o r L a Paz/E1 Alto-scaring 
away po ten t ia l investors and m a k i n g the 
bank ing system mo re j i t te ry . 
16. 
Throughout this entire d i f f i c u l t period, ove ra l l g row th in B o l i v i a has never been negative, 
although per capita g r ow t h rates have been negative. This i s surprising g iven the magnitude o f 
the shocks that the economy has faced, and stands in contrast t o the experience o f other L a t i n 
Ame r ican countries ( fo r example, Paraguay). Howeve r , i t must be no ted that the o f f i c i a l figures 
may understate the true changes g iven that so m u c h o f the economy i s i n f o rm a l and g iven that 
many o f the shocks affected the i n f o rm a l economy. 
17. 
L o o k i n g fo rwa rd , there are some p rom is ing signs as the economies o f B r a z i l and 
A rgen t ina have imp roved . This means that the external shocks reaching B o l i v i a are l i k e l y t o be, 
i f n o t positive, at least n o t as negative as they have been in the past. 

B. Po l i t ica l 

18. 
Ove r the last decade there has been a g row ing disenchantment w i t h the overt use o f 
p o l i t i c a l patronage and the tolerance, i f n o t actual support, o f co r rup t ion , on the pa r t o f the 
t rad i t iona l p o l i t i c a l parties. With the 'recent change in administration, this disenchantment gave 
way t o a to ta l re jec t ion o f the t rad i t iona l parties, and the Mesa cabinet was fo rmed ou t o f 
independent members. 
19. 
Other factors that have l e d t o a loss o f prestige and c r e d i b i l i t y o f the po l i t ica l parties and 
o f the government, in general, have been the lack o f transparency in t ransm i t t ing in fo rma t ion , the 

5 

20. 

poo r j o b o f commun ica t ing government policies, and the poo r j o b on implementation. This la t te r 
p rob lem i s caused, in part, by the h i g h turnover o f personnel associated w i t h p o l i t i c a l patronage. 
The reliance on p o l i t i c a l patronage can be traced back t o an electoral system that 
promotes coa l i t ion building as pa r t o f the process o f selecting the presidents. These coalitions 
tend t o be fo rmed no t o n the basis o f shared platforms, but on the basis o f t rad ing p o l i t i c a l 
patronage. The ma jo r p o l i t i c a l parties appear t o have increasing disagreements on p o l i c y 
d i r e c t i o n - c om p a r e d t o the late 1980s -ea r ly 1990s. 
21. 
The last several years have witnessed the r ise o f new p o l i t i c a l parties closely aligned w i t h 
indigenous groups. The increased mob i l iza t ion o f poo r and long-excluded people i s a pos i t ive 
force f o r development and f o r efforts t o reduce poverty. The grievances and demands be ing 
a i red by leaders o f the new groups cover a w ide gamut-a 
return t o t rad i t iona l values associated 
w i t h mos t ly r u r a l societies, opposition t o eradication o f coca cu l t iva t ion and suspicion o f 
“globalization,” among others. F o r a l l the variations, there i s l i t t l e question that unde r ly ing these 
movements i s a l o n g h is to ry o f social exc lus ion and inequa l i ty . W h i l e recent transitions t o 
democracy have b rough t gains, patterns o f in f luence rema in unequal, w i t h favo r i t ism , patronage 
and co r rup t ion o f ten persisting despite na t iona l and l o c a l elections. 
22. 
Ne i the r the government n o r the partners that w o r k w i t h the government can a f fo rd t o 
igno re the new voices. The challenge w i l l be t o incorporate a mu l t icu l tu ra l perspective in a way 
that does n o t cu t o f f the poo r and indigenous people f r o m the economic opportunities o f fe red by 
economic in teg ra t ion w i t h the outside wo r ld . There are r i s k s that the p o l i t i c a l movements w o u l d 
be dominated by groups that c o u l d reject the possible economic opportunities and, thereby, 
condemn the i r o w n fo l lowe rs t o continued ma rg ina l iza t ion . 

C. Social 

23. 
There i s an increasing and understandable impatience w i t h the levels o f inequality, 
pa r t icu la r ly as i t applies t o land. B o l i v i a i s among the mos t unequal countries in the mos t

Indigenous groups fee l (rightly so) that they have received l i t t l e f r o m the exp lo i ta t ion of 
natural resources in the past-silver 
and tin. These deep suspicions, plus suspicions w i t h the 
capitalization process, f e d oppos i t ion t o the natural gas expo r t project. General discontent was 
also fed by l a c k o f progress in income-related measures o f poverty. There has been progress in 
social indicators (again, uneven), but that has n o t been perceived by disaffected groups as 
enough. 
G r ow i n g tensions are apparent among regions, classes, and ind igenoushon ind igenous 
groups. The h igh land versus l ow l a n d tension also reflects a split between mainly Ayma ra and 
m a i n l y Spanish descendants. Part o f this tension has always been present; part has been created 
b y recent events where d i f fe ren t groups d o n o t share the same views and objectives. 
26. 
As part o f the social movement, there i s a desire f o r greater p o l i t i c a l and economic 
power. Even before the latest round o f con f l ic ts , i t appeared that pressuring the government 
through demonstrations in the streets-whether 
v io len t o r otherwise-was 
a winning strategy. 
The ab i l i ty t o topple a president demonstrates the powe r that i s present.

D. Ro le of Past Reforms 

28. 
B o l i v i a i s k n ow n in te rna t iona l ly f o r i t s series o f re fo rms da t ing back t o 1985, when i t 
enacted b o l d re fo rms t o e l im ina te hype r in f la t ion and t o reduce the r o l e o f the government in the 
economy. These re fo rms had many notable achievements (see Annex F), w i t h reforms in the 
social sectors have been among the mos t successful. A greater emphasis o n social po l ic ies was 
f o l l ow e d by a greater allocation o f resources and an observed impac t o n social indicators. Soc ia l 
expenditure increased f r o m 15.7 percent o f GDP in 1998 t o 19.6 percent in 2002 and the 
e f f ic iency and qua l i ty o f social services improved. 
29. 
In the health sector, the in t roduc t ion and imp lemen ta t ion o f the health r e f o rm has l e d t o 
an impo r tan t increase in coverage. K e y po l ic ies under the r e f o rm inc luded the in t roduc t ion o f a 
pub l ic hea l th insurance f o r maternal and c h i l d interventions and a series o f ve r t ica l ly financed 
programs t o tackle communicable diseases, an increase in hea l th s ta f f under the f ramewo rk o f 
the enhanced H e a v i l y Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) i n i t i a t i v e and the in t roduc t ion o f a results- 
based scheme that set yea r ly targets f o r k e y hea l th indicators. The imp lemen ta t ion o f these 
po l ic ies was f o l l ow e d by a significant advance in hea l th indicators. Coverage o f sk i l led birth 
increased f r o m 44 percent in 1998 t o 54 percent in 2001, coverage o f pre-natal con t ro l rose f r o m 
29 percent t o 37 percent in the same p e r i o d and a complete coverage o f pneumonias in ch i ld ren 
under 5 was reached. S im i la r ly , the malaria, Chagas and TB programs s ign i f ican t ly imp roved 
the i r coverage and qua l i ty . W h i l e this imp rovemen t in coverage i s remarkable, equ i ty gaps 
rema in as ru ra l , poo r and indigenous have l im i t e d access t o f o rm a l health services. An 
in te rcu l tu ra l approach t o hea l th care was recently in t roduced t o reduce cu l tu ra l barriers o f access 
t o health services. 
30. 
In the education sector, a transformation o f b o t h the ins t i tu t iona l and technical- 
pedagogical aspects o f the education system have taken place in the last f ew years. As a r e s u l t o f 
the imp lemen ta t ion o f the education re fo rm , there are several impo r tan t achievements, many o f 
them are re f lec ted in the behavior o f education indicators. B y 2001, the i l l i te racy rate decreased 
t o 13.3 percent. In ru ra l areas, there has been a drop o f 11 percentage po in ts in i l l i te racy rates, 
although the absolute l e v e l remains high at 25.8 percent. In urban areas, the i l l i te racy rate i s 
considerably l ow e r - 6.9 percent. The you th l i te racy rate i s n ow three percentage po in ts above 
the average o f the L a t i n Ame r ica and the Caribbean region, w h i c h reaches 94.1 percent. The 
gross coverage o f primary education stood at 108.4 percent w h i l e the net coverage ra t io 
increased t o 97 percent f o r b o t h girls and boys suggesting that B o l i v i a i s ve ry close t o achieving 
equal educational opportunities. Furthermore, mo re ch i ld ren finish p r ima ry school as the 
comp le t ion rate and the graduation rate imp roved w h i l e drop-out rates decreased. As in the 
health sector, indicators at the na t iona l l e v e l conceal differences among income and ethnic 
groups that have t o be tackled. 
31. 
Howeve r , the fact that B o l i v i a i s in the d i f f i c u l t situation i t i s in today has caused many 
observers (pa r t icu la r ly domestic observers) t o question h ow u s e f u l past reforms have been. T o 
some extent, there i s a tendency w i t h i n the coun t ry n o t t o appreciate B o l i v i a ’ s vu lne rab i l i ty t o 
external shocks and no t t o recognize the poss ib i l i ty that B o l i v i a ’ s situation might have been 
considerably worse i f i t h a d n o t enacted some o f the re fo rms i t did-particularly 
in f inanc ia l 
sector regulation. O f course, i t i s imposs ib le t o establish w i t h any degree o f certainty that 
B o l i v i a was better equipped t o face the shocks w i t h than w i thou t the reforms, because B o l i v i a 
faced these shocks on ly w i t h the re fo rms in place. No tw i ths tand ing this argument, i t i s 

8 

imposs ib le t o refute the statement that Bo l iv ia ’s reforms were n o t su f f ic ien t t o prevent the 
coun t ry f r o m f a l l i n g i n t o i t s current problems. This fact, alone, jus t i f ies a mo re c r i t ica l l o o k at 
the past re fo rms . 
32. 
There have been fou r problems w i t h the past reforms: (i) timing, (ii) implementation, (iii) 
financing, and ( iv ) adequacy o f the r e f o rm package. The timing p rob lem i s that many o f the 
re fo rms have costs in the short run and benefits in the future. This i s the case f o r the pension 
r e f o rm and education re fo rm , among others. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the re fo rms has no t always 
been as satisfactory as hoped (see Annex F). In some cases, p o l i t i c a l decisions have made 
re fo rms m o r e cos t ly than expected, o r have taken away po ten t ia l sources o f f inanc ing f o r them 
( fo r example, fa i lu re t o use cap i ta l iza t ion proceeds t o reduce pension r e f o rm costs). The timing 
and imp lemen ta t ion problems have con t r ibu ted t o the d i f f i c u l t y o f f inanc ing the complete 
package o f reforms. In retrospect, there does n o t seem t o have been an adequate j o b by either the 
governments o r the donor commun i ty3 o f adding up the costs o f simultaneously ca r ry ing ou t 
B o l i v i a ’ s comprehensive package o f reforms. Adding t o the problems o f f inanc ing were ove r ly 
op t im is t ic estimates o f g row th . W h e n the expected g row th rates did n o t materialize, the costs o f 
the extensive reforms began t o place an increasingly unsupportable burden o n government 
finances. F ina l ly , w h i l e there was a comprehensive package o f reforms, one pa r t icu la r type o f 
r e f o rm that i s conspicuous in i t s absence i s a r e f o rm t o reduce the m ic roeconom ic constraints t o 
growth. Indeed, outside o f a general attention t o the regulatory environment, there has been less 
emphasis o n developing the p roduc t ive sector than on ensuring mac ro s tab i l i ty , p romo t ing 
p o l i t i c a l ins t i tu t iona l i ty , and deve lop ing the social sectors. W i t h o u t growth, over t im e the social 
and ins t i tu t iona l reforms w i l l p rove t o be unaffordable f o r a coun t ry as poo r as B o l i v i a . 

E. Role of Intemational Assistance 

33. 
In add i t ion t o being k n ow n f o r i t s reforms, B o l i v i a i s k n o w n as a coun t ry that receives 
high leve ls o f external assistance. As w i t h the r o l e o f reforms, one cannot re fu te the statement 
that the international assistance has n o t been able t o prevent B o l i v i a f r o m f a l l i n g i n t o i t s current 
d i f f icu l t ies . T o some extent, the build-up o f the strong trends in the economic, social, and 
p o l i t i c a l arena has been obscured-first b y fa i th in reforms, i n i t i a l years o f democracy, and years 
o f some reasonable levels o f growth-then 
by a focus on a pove r ty reduc t ion strategy that 
perhaps p laced too much emphasis o n the task o f assigning H l pC resources. 
34. 
B o l i v i a ’ s pa r t ic ipa t ion in the HIPC p rog ram has he lped ma in ta in pove r ty -o r ien ted 
expenditure, but has n o t helped address the increasing f isca l d e f i c i t problems. T h e debt r e l i e f 
substitutes expenditure f o r repayment o f debt f o r expenditure o n pove r ty -o r ien ted programs. 
Howeve r , i t does no t address the p r o b l em o f expenditures in to ta l be ing greater than income. 
35. 
T h e international assistance has he lped B o l i v i a ma in ta in ove ra l l leve ls o f investment by 
increasing i t s leve l o f assistance t o compensate f o r the v i r tua l collapse o f p r iva te domestic 
investment. Indeed, the response b y the donor commun i ty p robab ly goes a l o n g w a y t o exp la in 
w h y B o l i v i a has no t experienced negative rates o f g row th (as m a n y other L a t i n Ame r ican 
countries have), despite being hit b y sizable external shocks. 
36. 
The benefits o f the in te rna t iona l assistance have come at a cost o f generating dependence. 
Ex te rna l resources n ow account f o r one - th i rd o f a l l pub l ic expenditure. The inescapable

conclusion i s that the size o f the government now exceeds the a b i l i t y o f the domestic economy t o 
support i t . This dependence should diminish over time, but cu r ren t ly i s d i f f i c u l t t o do so. Just as 
w i t h the f isca l deficit, wha t i s needed i s a path o f international assistance over the future that i s 
economically, po l i t ica l ly , and soc ia l ly viable. 
37. 
In the meantime, there are ce r ta in ly actions that c o u l d be taken immed ia te ly t o make the 
development assistance mo re effective. 
International assistance remains fragmented and 
dispersed, even after the in t roduc t ion o f the Comprehensive Deve lopmen t F ramewo rk (CDF). 
W h i l e there have been some pos i t ive effects w i t h the in t roduc t ion o f the C D F (w i t h better 
coordination in a few programs and a general acceptance o f C D F principles), there has no t been 
enough change in the n o rm a l business practices o f the d i f fe ren t agencies. The high leve l o f 
assistance remains one o f the most impo r tan t assets the coun t ry has t o h e l p pull i t s e l f out o f i t s 
current d i f f icu l t ies . Fu r the r e f fo r ts t o f o l l ow through o n imp lemen ta t ion o f the C D F principles 
w o u l d ce r ta in ly he lp the government make mo re effective use o f this asset. 

F. L a t i n Ame r ican Context 

38. 
The recent t u rm o i l in B o l i v i a i s n o t occurring in a vacuum. T h e impatience w i t h the slow 
pace o f pove r ty reduc t ion and reduc t ion in inequality, skep t ic ism about the ab i l i ty o f the 
Washington Consensus t o de l ive r the goods, disenchantment w i t h t rad i t iona l p o l i t i c a l leaders, 
the increasing appeal o f s imp le but erroneous p o l i c y prescriptions o f populism, and the g row th o f 
indigenous movements are trends occu r r ing in the Andean region, and perhaps in other regions 
as we l l . 

111. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY 

A. T ime Horizon fo r the Mesa Govemmen t 

39. 
The government o f President Mesa that took over in a cons t i tu t iona l transition o n 
October 17, 2003 f o l l ow i n g the fo rced resignation o f Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has moved 
q u i c k l y to formulate i t s plans. The plans have been fo rmu la ted t o cover tw o periods: (i) a f i r s t 
phase-from 
the present t o the planned comp le t ion o f a Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly (expected t o 
take between 14 and 18 months), and (ii) a second phase-from 
the end o f the Cons t i tu t iona l 
Assembly t o the end o f the cons t i tu t iona l te rm o f the President (that i s , until August 6, 2007). 
One o f the casualties o f the recent disturbances has been a shortening o f what i s considered the 
m e d i um term. Whereas p r i o r t o the social con f l ic t o f October, the government was preparing i t s 
rev ised Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) t o cover a med ium - te rm pe r iod up t o 2015, 
today the med ium t e r m i s considered t o be the pe r iod up t o 2007. 
I f the current Cons t i tu t ion were fo l lowed , the o n l y w a y in w h i c h President Mesa w o u l d 
n o t serve out the rema in ing presidential t e r m w o u l d be i f he were t o resign, in w h i c h case the 
president o f the Senate w o u l d then c a l l f o r new elections. Howeve r , as pa r t o f the upcom ing 
Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly, the rules o f the game cou ld change and (among other possible changes) 
the Constitutional Assemb ly c o u l d c a l l f o r new elections, whether President Mesa wished t o 
res ign o r not. 

40. 

10 

41. 
There i s s t i l l a risk that social con f l ic t c o u l d erupt again (around Feb rua ry /Ma rch 2004). 
Some oppos i t ion groups have g iven President Mesa a l im i t e d time t o resolve problems before 
launch ing another r o u n d o f social con f l ic t . I t i s clear that the demands cannot be met in the 
a l lo t ted t im e frame. I t remains to be seen whether the Mesa government can meet enough o f the 
p rev ious ly u n f u l f i l l e d demands to keep social peace. A l te rna t ive ly , the Mesa administration may 
be able t o conv ince the general pub l ic (and those threatening mo re social con f l ic t ) that the 
actions that the government i s ca r ry ing ou t are substantive, even i f they do n o t ma tch exactly the 
o r ig ina l demands. I f so, the Mesa administration m a y be g iven the t ime and social peace t o 
a l low i t t o ca r ry ou t i t s agenda. 

B. Objectives du r ing the F i rs t Phase 

42. 
During the f i r s t phase, the government w i l l be pursuing the f o l l ow i n g three p o l i t i c a l 
objectives : 
0 Rev is ing the hydrocarbons law ; 
Subm i t t ing the decision t o expo r t natural gas t o a pub l ic referendum; and 
C a l l i n g f o r a Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly t o m o d i f y the ex is t ing Constitution.

43. 
An impo r tan t element o f the government strategy i s t o tackle these three issues in 
sequence. T h e first d i f f i c u l t task i s t o revise the hydrocarbons l aw . There i s a strong perception 
among the general p u b l i c that B o l i v i a did n o t get a f a i r deal f r o m the ex is t ing gas contracts under 
the cap i ta l iza t ion process4, because the companies were able t o m o v e expenditures and income in 
such a w a y as t o m i n im i z e taxes. This perception was one o f the strong factors f u e l i n g 
opposition t o the gas expo r t projects during the con f l ic ts o f October 2003. President Mesa w o u l d 
build p o l i t i c a l c red ib i l i ty (and also needed tax revenue) i f he c o u l d increase the government 
"take" o n hydrocarbons. This w o u l d have t o be done in consensus w i t h o i l and gas companies t o 
avo id negative repu ta t ion effects that w o u l d resu l t f r o m un i la te ra l action o n the part o f the 
government. There i s some potential f o r success in this e f fo r t because the gas companies m a y 
t a k e the long - te rm v iew that some concessions are needed in order t o make fu tu re gas exports 
viable. 
44. 
I f the outcome w i t h the rev is ion o f the hydrocarbons l aw i s successful, the government 
w o u l d have mo re p o l i t i c a l we igh t t o put beh ind a pos i t ive vote t o export gas. I t i s essential that 
the general pub l ic perceives that the government w i l l act in the best interests o f the poo r and 
excluded in setting the terms o f the agreements o n gas exports, especially g iven the fa i lu re o f 
past exp lo i ta t ion o f vast reserves o f s i lve r and tin t o bene f i t the poo r . The issue o f gas i s v iewed 
as be ing o f such high stakes because the poo r see gas as the i r last chance t o take advantage o f 
r i c h natural resources. 
I t i s n o t en t i re ly clear at this state wha t the w o r d i n g w i l l be in the 
referendum. B o l i v i a already exports gas. Past oppos i t ion has been t o future proposals t o expo r t 
gas through Ch i le . The p rev ious administration was n o t able t o convince the poo r and exc luded 

4. Under the leadership o f President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when President in 1993-97, the B o l i v i a n 
government p rov ided a he lp ing hand to the nation's economy us ing Capitalization," a unique approach 
invo lv ing the pr iva te sector through wh ich strategic partners make investments in pub l ic enterprises in exchange 
for management con tro l . At the same time, government interest in the capitalization enterprises i s used t o 
finance pensions fo r i t s citizens 65 years and older. B y 1996 capitalizations had been completed in e lec tr ic i ty , 
telecommunications, aviation, ra i lways and hydrocarbons.

that i t was wo r lung t o defend their interests. I t remains t o be seen whether this administration 
w i l l be mo re successful. The recent agreement that Indonesia made t o supply gas to Ca l i fo rn ia 
w i l l complicate Bo l iv ia ’s search f o r markets, but may make i t mo re l i k e l y that a pos i t ive vote on 
the Gas Referendum w i l l be obtained. 
F ina l ly , i f the government i s successful in managing the first t w o activities, i t cou ld be in 
a su f f ic ien t ly strong pos i t ion t o manage the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly. There are some 
deficiencies in the current Cons t i tu t ion that c o u l d conceivably be im p r o v e d through the 
Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly. Three po ten t ia l improvements w o u l d be: (i) t o imp rove the selection 
process o f electing the President t o reduce incentives t o trade votes f o r p o l i t i c a l patronage; (ii) t o 
a l l ow representatives t o be elected w i thou t the requirement that they be members o f na t iona l 
p o l i t i c a l parties; and (iii) t o c l a r i f y issues related t o regional autonomy. Howeve r , conduc t ing a 
Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly under the current c l ima te o f uncertainty i s a highly risky undertaking 
because, once the Assembly i s convened, i t w o u l d have the powe r t o change any th ing in the 
Constitution. While there had been some support f o r a Cons t i tu t iona l Assemb ly in the last 
several years, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada resisted these calls until the last days o f his 
administration. Once he p u b l i c l y agreed t o c a l l the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly ( two days before 
the change), i t became p o l i t i c a l l y imposs ib le f o r President Mesa t o go back o n that agreement, 
even i f he had wanted to. 
46. 
I n add i t ion t o the three p o l i t i c a l objectives, the govemment w i l l be attempting t o achieve 
the f o l l ow i n g three economic objectives: 
0 Res to r ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty ; 
0 Reo r ien t ing some pub l ic expenditure towa rd h i g h - v i s i b i l i t y programs that respond t o 
unde r ly ing factors that l e d t o social con f l ic t , especially in sensitive geographical areas; 
and 
Re - launch ing the ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm p rog ram and anticorruption efforts. 

47. 
The government’s economic team i s p lac ing considerable emphasis o n res to r ing 
macroeconomic stability, w h i c h i s impo r tan t g iven a l l other po ten t ia l signals o f ins tab i l i ty . T o 
restore macroeconomic stability, the government w i l l have t o chart a p ro jec ted pa th o f the f isca l 
de f ic i t that i s economically, socially, and p o l i t i c a l l y feasible. That the f isca l de f ic i t w i l l have t o 
be reduced i s clear t o most observers, but n o t necessarily t o a l l groups in B o l i v i a . H o w far and 
h ow fast the f isca l de f ic i t w i l l have t o f a l l depends t o a large extent o n the ava i lab i l i ty o f external 
f inanc ing and, in particular, o n the ava i lab i l i ty o f donations and concessional financing. 
48. While macroeconomic s tab i l i ty i s necessary, i t i s c lea r ly n o t su f f ic ien t f o r B o l i v i a . 
H i g h l y v is ib le actions need t o be taken t o beg in t o address some o f the unde r ly ing problems 
behind the social con f l ic t . There needs t o be a sense o f urgency t o the task because f rus t ra t ion 
w i t h the pace o f pove r ty reduc t ion and w i t h actions t o reduce inequa l i ty are generating a 
dangerous dynamic. Social c o n f l i c t and fu r the r deterioration in the a b i l i t y o f the economic 
system t o generate g row th c o u l d continue t o feed o f f each other and send B o l i v i a i n t o a 
downwa rd spiral. The govemment w i l l be launch ing some efforts t o address the problems in the 
n e x t several months, w i t h further e f fo r ts t o be undertaken as part o f the rev ised PRSP. 
49. 
The third ma jo r p r i o r i t y i s t o relaunch the ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm process that stagnated 
under the Sanchez de Lozada administration. Carlos Mesa was b rough t in as v ice president t o be 
the champion f o r ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm and anticorruption efforts, but was w i d e l y v iewed as

b locked b y the coa l i t ion members f r om acting. The coun t ry wants t o see wha t President Mesa i s 
prepared t o do n ow that he i s no t constrained as before. 
50. 
The six p r io r i t ies address some o f the economic, po l i t ica l , and social problems in a 
ho l is t ic fashion. These p r io r i t ies w i l l have to be augmented by additional activities supporting a 
med ium - te rm v i s i o n that w i l l be dealt w i t h in the process o f rev is ing the PRSP. 

C. Objectives f o r the Second Phase 

51. 
The second phase o f the Mesa administration w o u l d begin once the Cons t i tu t iona l 
Assembly ends. By the beg inn ing o f the second phase, the government w o u l d hope t o have: (i)

T o a r r ive at that desired outcome w i l l require preparatory w o r k that must beg in be fo re the 
Constitutional Assemb ly ends. The government has already begun the process t o revise the 
PRSP. The starting p o i n t f o r the revisions i s the document presented at the October 2003 
Consultative G roup meeting. This document was structured around three strategic areas: (i) 
productive development o f m ic ro , sma l l and med ium -s ized enterprises; (ii) social development 
of a minimum se t o f services; and (iii) social exc lus ion and cross-cutting p u b l i c policies. In 
addition, the document presents what are termed imp lemen ta t ion comm i tmen ts t o ensure 
ins t i tu t iona l sustainability, f isca l sustainability and pa r t ic ipa t ion and dialogue. F ina l ly , the 
document considers resource a l loca t ion and f inanc ia l requirements t o ach iev ing the targets in the 
revised PRSP and discusses h ow the government w o u l d propose t o move f o rw a r d w i t h a greater

adequate in fo rma t ion about the nature o f the fiscal problems fac ing the country. I n v is i ts that the 
W o r l d B a n k made to d i f fe ren t regions to discuss the CAS , i t was clear that most people and mos t 
ins t i tu t ions pa r t ic ipa t ing in the meetings did no t have this in fo rma t ion . 
The government plans t o w o r k closely w i t h the donor commun i ty t o bring about needed 
changes t o the ove ra l l po r t fo l io . This w i l l be done in con junc t ion w i t h a fo l low -up t o the High 
L e v e l F o r um o n Ha rmon iza t ion held in Rome in February 2003 and w i t h an ove ra l l e f fo r t t o

Desp i te the ove ra l l uncertainty p reva i l ing in B o l i v i a at this moment, m o v i n g q u i c k l y w i t h 
the process o f rev is ing the PRSP makes sense. I f this process were t o be delayed until after the 
Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly, there m i g h t be a risk that those (understandingly) frustrated w i t h the 
s low pace o f pove r ty reduc t ion w o u l d try t o resolve the problems through r ew r i t i n g the 
Cons t i tu t ion rather than through the mo re reasonable approach o f setting short and med ium - te rm 
pub l ic po l icy . The PRSP provides d i rec t ion t o pub l ic p o l i c y and a foca l po in t around w h i c h 
international assistance c o u l d be organized. The W o r l d B a n k continues t o support strongly the 
PRSP process. 
I t i s unlikely that the rev ised PRSP w o u l d be ready be fo re Ju ly 2004-and 
possibly later. 
H o w aggressive the pove r ty reduc t ion targets set f o r t h in the rev ised PRSP can be depends o n 
fu tu re tax revenue, which, in turn, depends o n the outcome o f the Gas Referendum. Since the 
nature o f the coun t ry cou ld change d rama t ica l ly depending o n the outcomes o f the Cons t i tu t iona l 
Assembly, the nature o f the PRSP might also be expected t o change as a consequence.

W h i l e the government i s presenting a clear and reasonable strategy f o r m o v i n g forward, 
there are m a n y r i s k s that have t o be faced. Am o n g the main r i s k s are the fo l low ing : 
The Congress i s s t i l l con t ro l led by t rad i t iona l p o l i t i c a l parties. I t i s n o t clear that they 
w i l l be supportive o f the administration’s agenda. 
President Mesa c o u l d n o t serve ou t the remainder o f the president’s constitutional term. 
A new government c o u l d adopt po l ic ies that lead t o fu r the r deterioration o f the economic 
situation. A new government c o u l d enjoy less support than that o f President Mesa. 
Strong demands are be ing p laced o n the government f r o m many different sectors, but the 
government has limited a b i l i t y t o respond. D issa t is fac t ion w i t h the government’s 
response cou ld trigger a new r o u n d o f social con f l ic t . 
While some groups genuinely w o u l d l i k e t o see the i r demands met, there are several 
groups that have l i t t l e interest in demands be ing me t and w o u l d prefer t o see the 
government fail and fa l l . They w o u l d b e w i l l i n g t o w o r k ac t ive ly t o t r y t o bring this 
about. 
The bank ing and f inanc ia l sector remains fragile. 
M u c h o f the pub l ic has disdain f o r the concept o f a budget constraint. They want the i r 
demands met now , yet the re i s a reluctance t o pay taxes. Part o f the reluctance t o p a y 
taxes i s due to perceived co r rup t ion .and t o the perception that they are n o t getting 
services, but me re ly pay ing f o r salaries o f government o f f ic ia ls . 
There i s considerable uncertainty surrounding the l e v e l o f fo re ign assistance that w i l l be 
forthcoming-particularly 
in the c r i t ica l area o f donations f r o m bilaterals.

I t i s impo r tan t t o assess whether B o l i v i a c o u l d a f fo rd t o contract the proposed amounts 
w i thou t running i n t o d i f f icu l t ies o f debt sustainability. T o answer that question, the B a n k ca r r ied 
out a detailed analysis o f B o l i v i a ’ s debt sustainability based on several scenarios-with 
and 
w i thou t revenues f r o m the export o f natural gas, w i t h an aggressive fiscal adjustment that c o u l d 
be p o l i t i c a l l y d i f f i c u l t t o achieve, and w i t h a less aggressive f isca l adjustment that m a y be 
p o l i t i c a l l y and soc ia l ly mo re viable. Scenarios w i thou t f isca l adjustment have been analyzed. as 
we l l , but they are c lea r ly n o t sustainable, so their results w i l l n o t be presented here.5 
The results o f the different scenarios are summarized in Table 3. The baseline scenario 
assumes that there w i l l be a pos i t ive vote on the Gas Referendum, but that the gas p ro jec t w i l l 
n o t s t a r t until 2008, w i t h exports com ing on l i n e three years la te r in 2011. The baseline scenario 
w i t h gas and a less aggressive f isca l adjustment i s the mos t v iab le scenario in economic, p o l i t i c a l 
and social terms. Howeve r , i t does present a p rob lem o f increasing domestic debt. 
In this 
baseline scenario f isca l sustainability w o u l d be strengthened i f add i t iona l donations o r 
concessional credits are made available t o reduce the im p l i e d pa th o f domestic debt. The 
scenario w i thou t gas and w i t h less aggressive adjustment i s n o t f isca l ly sustainable. W i t h o u t gas, 
the situation i s sustainable o n l y under the assumption o f an aggressive f isca l adjustment. With 
gas and an aggressive f isca l adjustment makes the situation econom ica l ly mos t sustainable, but at 
a cost o f the p o l i t i c a l and social v iab i l i ty .

Ano the r impo r tan t conclusion d rawn f r o m emp i r ica l results i s that the compos i t ion o f 
W o r l d B a n k lending between IDA and IBRD f inanc ing doesn’t affect f isca l sustainability results. 
De ta i ls o f the calculations under the baseline scenarios and results under alternative scenarios are 
presented in Annex C . 

5. The debt sustainability exercise was prepared b y W o r l d B a n k s ta f f b u i l d i n g o n technical consultations w i t h 
B o l i v i a n authorities. The exercise i s based o n loan-by- loan data p rov ided b y the authorities and creditors. The 
external debt outstanding i s as o f end-2002, and includes the debt r e l i e f prov ided under the H IPC , enhanced 
H I PC In i t ia t ives , and beyond H IPC . Da ta o n the pub l ic sector’s domestic debt employed i s as o f December 31, 
2002, and has been p rov ided b y the Treasury. In fo rma t ion o n new external disbursements has been p rov ided b y 
the Central Bank. Once a l l iden t i f ied external f inanc ia l f l ow s are taken in to account, i t i s assumed that the 
pr iva te sector obtains add i t iona l f inanc ing f r om the external pr iva te sector (at commercial terms) to close the 
external accounts. T o close the f isca l gap, the government i s assumed to sell US$-denominated 3-year bonds 
and 15-year treasury b i l ls ( to Adm in is trudoru de Fondo de Pensiones [ A F P s ] ) . 
I t i s assumed that this

To take i n t o account the uncertainty o f hav ing a baseline scenario that assumes a pos i t ive 
vote o n the Gas Referendum, the B a n k pe r fo rmed a M o n t e Ca r lo s imu la t ion o n the trends o f the 
pub l ic debt t o GDP ra t io w i t h d i f fe ren t assumed starting dates f o r the gas project. The 
s imu la t ion exercise assigns a u n i f o rm p robab i l i ty t o the gas project starting between 2005 and 
2035 and then introduces fu r the r uncertainty in the assumptions o f the rea l GDP growth, 
devaluation and i n f l a t i o n 6 Forecast confidence intervals are generated that estimate the 
l i k e l i h o o d o f the future situation o f the pub l ic debt o f B o l i v i a based o n the d is t r ibu t ion o f 
assumed values o f the key economic variables. 

68. 
The results in F igu re 5 ind ica te w i t h 90 percent confidence p robab i l i ty that, assuming a 
progressive f isca l adjustment, the r a t i o o f nom ina l stock o f pub l ic debt t o GDP (at 67.8 percent 
o f GDP in 2003) shows a tendency t o contract f r o m 2006 onwards. This t rend fo l lows the sudden 
increase associated w i t h the high levels o f deficits expected f o r the com ing years (2003 -05 ) . In 
the wo rs t cases, this ra t io w o u l d n o t decrease t o current levels but w o u l d stabilize close t o 75 
percent o f GDP. 

69 . 
T w o additional scenarios were analyzed to take i n t o account t w o immed ia te concerns 
about the economy: (i) the possible i n a b i l i t y t o attain a progressive f isca l adjustment (Scenario 
5 ) ; and (ii) the effects o f a f inanc ia l crisis (Scenario 6 ) . B o t h scenarios adopt the pessimistic 
assumption that the gas project w o u l d n o t materialize at a l l . F igu re 6 illustrates the results o f 
Scenario 5: where the service o f domestic debt becomes such a heavy bu rden f o r f isca l accounts 
that by 2008 the ra t io o f nom ina l stock t o GDP enters in an unstable exp lod ing path. D u e t o

corre la t ion has been introduced to take in to account iner t ia in the evo lu t ion o f these variables. S im i lar ly , 
correlations between growth, i n f l a t i o n and devaluation were also introduced. The assumptions o f the s imu la t ion

evaluated how results vary when the p robab i l i ty de term in ing the scenario w i t h gas or w i thou t gas; s imu la t ion

LAND REFORM PROJECT. The ma jo r i s s u e in land r e f o rm i s that the process o f l a n d t i t l i n g 
and regu la r iza t ion has advanced too s low ly . A f t e r six years o f imp lemen ta t ion o f the Znstituto

hectares have been redistributed than expected. A round 4,000 titles have been p rov ided t o 
p rope r ty owners and six m i l l i o n hectares have been regularized, yet there are around 8,000 t i t l e s 
that rema in m i r e d in the bureaucratic process and ove r 24 m i l l i o n hectares in process o f

The process o f land red is t r ibu t ion i s generating social unrest. Because the amount o f land

SPATIAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. This p ro jec t w o u l d support: (i) l o c a l 
development planning, (ii) organizational support t o producers and service providers, and (iii) 
the development o f new mechanisms t o finance economic development. In this l ine , the B a n k 
w o u l d support p roduc t ive development in i t ia t ives that w i l l be prepared by the producers, in 
response t o l o c a l economic development plans. This p ro jec t complements the Pa r t ic ipa to ry 
Ru ra l Investment Project and the Decen t ra l iza t ion PSAC , but emphasizes commun i ty 
pa r t ic ipa t ion and producer’s needs.

This project w o u l d he lp address some o f the great differences that exist in U nm e t Bas ic 
Needs (UBN) between regions and the increasing divergence in economic outcomes across 
regions. I t i s wo r r isome that differences in UBN are deepening in spite o f government programs 
p romo t ing greater decentralization. An i n i t i a l analysis o f UBN va r ia t ion between mun ic ipa l i t ies 
in the pe r iod 1992-2001 shows that there are close t o 80 mun ic ipa l i t ies in w h i c h the p ropo r t ion 
o f the popu la t ion w i t h unsatisfied basic needs has increased.’ Overall, the rate increased in 5 
departments (Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Tarija, Santa C ruz and Pando) and actually diminished 
in 4 others (La Paz, Oruro, Po tos i and Beni). The case o f Po tos i i s pa r t icu la r ly dramatic since 
the rate f o r the latter pe r iod i s close to zero (0.09 percent pe r year). This g row ing divergence, 
m i r r o r i n g that between urban and ru ra l areas, signals the pa r t ia l fa i lu re o f equalization po l ic ies 
imp lemen ted through decentralization and sector reforms. Thus, the difference o f 41.7 percent in 
the p ropo r t ion o f popu la t ion w i t h unmet basic needs between Santa C ruz and Po tos i signals a 
coun t ry becom ing increasingly polarized.

I n spite o f the g row ing importance o f agricultural exports f r o m some l ow l a n d areas, 
economic g row th has f o l l ow e d an enclave pattern, w i t h h i g h l y capital-intensive investment in a 
few sectors (mos t ly hydrocarbons) and l i t t l e effect in ru ra l areas due t o the sma l l g row th in 
employment and in demand f o r ag r icu l tu ra l products. This pattern has been re in fo rced b y the 
opening o f the B o l i v i a n economy and the incapac i ty o f most f o o d farmers (i.e. mos t ly peasant 
farmers) t o compete w i t h cheap impo r ts . The ru ra l economy i s be ing increasingly po la r ized 
between a peasant sector, mos t ly dedicated t o f o o d production, and an “entrepreneurial” f a rm 
sector mos t ly dedicated t o the p roduc t ion o f expo r t cash crops. A study o f 40 communities in the 
B o l i v i a n highlands” con f i rmed that w i t h i n the peasant sector close t o 80 percent o f producers 
were caught in a v ic ious cyc le o f ag r icu l tu ra l intensification, land degradation and diminishing 
income. S ign i f ican t ly , 20 percent o f the farmers in the sector had managed t o break ou t o f this 
negative cyc le and showed improvements in p roduc t iv i ty and income even in the A l t ip lano , 
show ing that ecosystemic characteristics did n o t represent absolute l im i ta t ions t o pove r ty 
reduction, as i s o f ten argued.”

project. The decision o n w h i c h loan t o prepare w o u l d depend on the need f o r fu r the r bank and 
corporate restructuring, on the effectiveness o f the measures inc luded in the f i r s t programmatic

SECOND INST ITUT IONAL REFORM PROJECT. The ex is t ing Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm p ro jec t was 
restructured t o a l low the government t o meet i t s pressing f isca l needs in 2003. The new project 
w o u l d be designed t o support the Government’s new d i rec t ion in ins t i tu t iona l reform, possibly 
i n c l u d i n g j u d i c i a l re fo rm . I t w o u l d also he lp support the government’s a n t i - c om p t i o n program. 
There i s active w o r k in this area by other donors (Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden, U n i t e d 
K i n g d om among others). T h e first Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm Project was co f inanced w i t h other 
donors. I t i s expected that this w o u l d be as we l l . In fact, the Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm Program 
supports Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm Agreements (AR I in Spanish) aimed at strengthening pub l ic sector 
agencies. The first p rog ram supported the r e f o rm process in few agencies, i n c l u d i n g the Ministry 
o f Finance, Ag r icu l tu re , Hous ing and Education. The AR I lays ou t spec i f ic actions, such as full 
operation o f integrated f inanc ia l system, use o f budgeting b y results, and a func t ion ing 
performance evaluation system, ind ica ted b y the pub l ica t ion o f annual evaluations t o be 
undertaken w i t h the a i m o f ach iev ing measurable improvements in p rog ram effectiveness. The 
imp lemen ta t ion o f AR I actions i s k e y t o achieve an e f f ic ien t p u b l i c sector, and t o the ove ra l l 
B a n k assistance p rog ram (see Tab le 5). Fa i lu re t o comp ly w i t h at least 75 percent o f the AR I

at least 90 percent o f the ARI actions w i l l contribute to place B o l i v i a in the high case scenario.

wo r lung in the eduction sector. The country needs assistance in fo rmu la t ing strategy and 
f inanc ing investments in secondary education. A key element w i l l be managing the h i r i n g o f 
teachers f o r secondary education as secondary education i s expanded. Currently, student- 
teacher ratios are l o w at the p r ima ry leve l . Re t ra in ing excess p r im a r y teachers and p lac ing them 
in secondary schools c o u l d result in huge cost savings compared t o the practice o f first hiring a l l 
the secondary teachers and then rea l iz ing that the coun t ry cannot a f fo rd such an ove ra l l l o w

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW (PER). The PER, wh ich i s be ing ca r r ied ou t j o i n t l y w i t h 
the In te r -Ame r ican Development Bank, examines sources o f recent fast expenditure increases, 
the budget process, the sustainability o f social p ro tec t ion programs, and the equ i tab i l i ty and 
e f f ic iency o f pub l ic sector service de l ive ry in B o l i v i a . The u l t ima te goa l o f the repo r t i s t o 
p rov ide p o l i c y recommendations t o address B o l i v i a ’ s pressing pub l ic expenditure issues, t o he lp 
re tu rn B o l i v i a t o a sustainable f isca l path, and t o imp rove the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f 
pub l ic services. The PER analysis indicates that (i) pension costs and the wage b i l l have been 
significant d r ive rs o f fast expenditure g row th in recent years; (ii) there have been improvements 
in the budget process in the context o f B o l i v i a ’ s PRSP, but much remains t o be done t o e l im ina te 
sources o f soft budget constraints; (iii) social p ro tec t ion outlays have increased in recent years 
and are considered sustainable; and ( iv ) the HIPC in i t ia t ives have resulted in mo re equitable

the coun t ry w o u l d have n o choice but t o cut “ in f lex ib le ” expenditures. Thus, i t w o u l d be prudent 
t o p roac t ive ly map ou t a mo re sustainable expenditure pattern that-if 
ou t r igh t cuts-at 
least takes strong action t o con t ro l the rate o f increase o f expenditure wh ich has 
been re la t ive ly high over the last several years re la t ive t o the country’s ab i l i ty t o generate 
domestic resources. The PER provides some assistance in p r i o r i t i z i n g expenditures t o generate a 
mo re sustainable path in the future. 
97. 
In add i t ion t o the wo r r isome g row th o f pub l ic expenditures in recent years, the 
sustainability o f reforms i s cause f o r concern. B o l i v i a ’ s re fo rms since the mid-1980s have been 
supported through in te rna t iona l cooperation. The f inanc ia l sustainability o f these reforms i s in 
some doubt. G iven that some o f the reforms were designed t o increase revenue, they have either 
n o t realized as much revenue as expected o r have met w i t h resistance (e.g., the tax r e f o rm and 
the c i v i l service reform). The re fo rms that invo lve expenditures have p roven t o be mo re cos t ly 
than expected (e.g., pension reform), pa r t ly due t o g row th rate overestimations-a phenomenon 
that characterized the who le L a t i n Ame r ica reg ion in the 1990s. These r e f o rm shortcomings 
make i t impe ra t ive t o ra t iona l ize pub l ic expenditures f o r the purposes o f achieving f isca l 
sustainability . 
98. 
The PER also p rov ides a good basis on wh ich t o organize a l l international assistance t o 
ensure f inanc ia l sustainability o f ex is t ing reforms. M a n y o f the donor agencies’ plans are n ow 
based on the assumption that past re fo rms are f inanc ia l ly sustainable, and that future assistance 
need o n l y build upon s o l i d past reforms. T o ensure f inanc ia l sustainability o f past reforms, 
future assistance must b e directed t o put the reforms back o n f i rm e r f inanc ia l foo t ing . This 
should be done in a pa r t ic ipa to ry way-with other donors and the government. 
99. 
COUNTRY FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTABILITY ASSESSMENT 
(CFAA ) . The new C F A A , 
cu r ren t ly underway, w h i c h i s be ing carried out j o i n t l y w i t h the In te r -Ame r ican Deve lopmen t 
B a n k (IDB), w i l l examine mo re c lose ly the issues o f revenue management, the structure o f 
in te rna l controls and audits, the qua l i ty and pe r iod ic i ty o f government reporting, and the system 
f o r t rack ing pove r ty reduc t ion expenditures ( inc lud ing H I P C funds), and w i l l build upon the first 
diagnostic study that was carried ou t in 1999. Add i t iona l ly , the C F A A w i l l also examine the 
rules and regulations (and the i r application) that govern f isca l decentralization and the absorptive 
capacity at the loca l government l e v e l t o adhere t o standards. The C F A A w i l l be complemented 
by the European Commission’s Comp l iance Test, w h i c h w i l l examine the qua l i ty o f expenditures 
w i t h i n several sectors (and test the con t ro l systems w i t h i n these sectors). The comb ina t ion o f 
b o t h analytical works w i l l p rov ide a full and robust p ic tu re o f the qua l i ty o f Bo l iv ia ’s Pub l ic

t o l o o k at inequa l i ty and at factors that impede poo r people’s a b i l i t y t o generate income. The 
proposed Pove r ty Assessment complements recent analytical w o r k o n pove r ty conducted b y the 
B a n k w i t h the B o l i v i a n government. In 2000 the B a n k prepared a pove r ty diagnostic repo r t in

wh ich the poo r de r ived mos t o f the i r income and the m a i n bottlenecks and market failures 
a f fec t ing them. 
102. EDUCATION SECTOR STUDY. Since the passing o f the Educa t ion R e f o rm l aw in 1994, 
B o l i v i a has embarked o n a pa th o f strong educational reforms that have been impressive in scope 
and pos i t ive in y ie ld ing results. A f t e r an increase o f 22.7 percentage po in ts in net en ro l lmen t 
since 1990, universal primary enrollment i s ve ry close t o be ing achieved. F o r secondary 
education, the results are also impressive: an increase o f 21.5 percentage po in ts in six years. N o t 
o n l y did B o l i v i a imp rove educational results over time, i t also n ow does better than m u c h o f 
L a t i n America, pa r t icu la r ly when pe r capita income i s con t ro l led fo r . 
103. These re la t ive ly pos i t ive results should not, however, be reason f o r complacency. The 
educational r e f o rm process i s far f r o m finished, since much o f the o r ig ina l p lan remains t o be 
completed. In some areas, such as i n i t i a l teacher t ra in ing and evaluation systems, the r e f o rm 
process appears t o have advanced further, and in others, such as decentralization, i t appears t o be 
in a d i f f i c u l t m idd le -o f - the - road pos i t ion . Also, the pos i t ive results that are shown above are 
themselves creating new challenges. F o r example, improvements in primary education access 
and comp le t ion have b rough t about ve ry sizeable increases in secondary school demand, w h i c h 
must be q u i c k l y accommodated. T h e objective o f the Educa t ion Sector Study w i l l be t o analyze 
where B o l i v i a stands today in the pa th o f i t s education r e f o rm process and map ou t the 
challenges that l i e ahead, a l l in order t o imp rove student attainment and achievement t o p rov ide 
f o r a better-educated popu la t ion in B o l i v i a .

ante analysis o f consequences o f p o l i c y changes. I t w i l l be pa r t icu la r ly impo r tan t in this p e r i o d 
o f uncertainty t o carry ou t this type o f analysis. This w o r k w i l l be carried ou t j o i n t l y w i t h the 
IMF and the government’s p o l i c y analysis unit, UDAPE. With W o r l d B a n k and IMF assistance, 
the government w i l l have in place greater capab i l i ty t o anticipate effects o f p o l i c y changes that 
they might propose o r that might be proposed by the opposition.

108. 
I n conjunction w i t h the B a n k support t o growth, I F C w i l l continue to p rov ide support f o r 
p r iva te sector development over the nex t C A S period. 
IFC ’s support w i l l focus on: (i) 
m o n i t o r i n g o f the ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o t o ensure that IFC - f inanced projects c o u l d weather these 
d i f f i c u l t times; (ii) technical assistance and capacity building th rough a new reg iona l Sma l l - and

microenterprises; and (iii) selectively p rov id ing f inanc ing f o r viable, high impac t projects in such 
sectors as the hydrocarbons sector, infrastructure inc lud ing power, the social sectors, the 
f inanc ia l market, and mining. 
109. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 
DEVELOPMENTS. The p r iva te sector, i n c l u d i n g I F C clients, has been negatively affected by the 
economic s lowdown that the coun t ry has been experiencing during the past f ew years and the 
uncertainties associated w i t h p o l i t i c a l developments. 
In light o f these events, the domestic 
bank ing sector has been experiencing an increase in non -pe r fo rm ing loans. Tha t has n o t been the 
case f o r I F C po r t fo l io where N o n Pe r fo rm ing Loans ( N p L s ) remained under 0.5 percent (as end- 
October 2003). Howeve r , rema in ing uncertainties in the coun t ry c o u l d have add i t iona l impacts 
o n the performance o f IFC ’ s clients. 
IFC ’s ac t iv i ty w i l l emphasize prudent p o r t f o l i o 
management t o arres t , t o the extent possible, adverse effects o f economic and p o l i t i c a l 
developments that c o u l d impac t i t s clients. 
110. STRENGTHENING S M E s AND MICROENTERPRISES. 
I F C w i l l he lp strengthen S M E s and 
microenterprises in B o l i v i a through the n ew l y established L A C S M E Fac i l i ty , approved by the

and other agriculture related operations) w i l l continue t o be promoted. 
Box 1. LAC SME Facility in Bolivia 

W i t h the B o a r d approval in June 2003, the W o r l d Bank - IFC SME Department has launched the LAC S M E Fac i l i ty , 
a mu l t i-donor technical assistance and capacity b u i l d i n g program to promote pr iva te sector development through 
support to SME s . I n i t i a l l y i t covers Bolivia, Peru, Honduras and N icaragua . In Bo l iv ia , the Program was in i t ia ted 
upon a request o f the government in November 2002. 
Curren t ly over 90 percent o f the work force in B o l i v i a i s employed in the MSME sector, generating on ly 35 
percent o f the GDP. A large leve l o f economic ac t iv i ty remains in the in fo rma l sector ( i n the manu fac tur ing sector 
nearly 100,000 establishments). One factor f o r the h i g h leve l o f in fo rma l i ty i s the h i g h cost o f do ing business in 
B o l i v i a . Studies consistently rank B o l i v i a as one o f the most bureaucratic countries in the wor ld . 
W o r k i n g w i th organizations and ins t i tu t ions that support SMEs, such as business associations and 
registries, f inanc ia l institutions, governments, N G O partners, universities, trainers, the Fac i l i ty w i l l focus i t s m a i n 
ac t iv i ty on: (i) improving the capacity of f inanc ia l institutions to better serve the S M E market b y upgrad ing the 

32 

s k i l l s required to reach SMEs and analysis o f the instruments such as leasing; (ii) improving the business enabling 
environment b y supporting selected government and W o r l d Bank in i t ia t ives (e.g. reg is tra t ion and licensing 
s imp l i f ica t ion) par t icu lar ly at the mun ic ipa l level; (iii) supporting the development of clusters in specific sectors in 
B o l i v i a to expand h i g h value added exports and create jobs and increase incomes pa r t icu la r ly in sectors that have 
h igh potential fo r pover ty a l lev ia t ion such as quinoa and wood; and ( iv) depending on donor support, a number o f 
additional activities or “special programs” are envisaged, inc lud ing : support to m icro- f inance institutions and SME 
development programs to link ru ra l producers in to urban and export markets, and linkages programs in the o i l and 
gas sectors. 

1 1 1. SELECTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN PROJECTS WH ICH C AN DEMONSTRATE V IAB LE INVESTMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES. 

IFC w i l l consider supporting viable, h i g h impac t transactions in such areas as 
hydrocarbons, in f ras t ruc tu re inc lud ing power, the social sector, the f inanc ia l market, and mining 
as opportunities arise and investment c l ima te improves. W h i l e the re la t ive ly sma l l size o f 
B o l i v i a ’ s economy constrains the development o f larger indus t r ia l enterprises w h i c h c o u l d

shortages o f sources o f long - te rm f inanc ing in B o l i v i a . 
112. 
HYDROCARBONS 
SECTOR. D u e to the importance o f the natural gas sector t o GDP- 
g row th and government tax revenues, IFC w o u l d consider pa r t ic ipa t ing in f inanc ing projects 
related t o transporting and value-added use o f the gas and i t s associated crude, such as domestic 
and export gas pipelines, gas t o liquid (GTL) plants, improvements in ex is t ing refineries, 
fe r t i l ize r plants. The degree o f IFC’s pa r t ic ipa t ion wou ld , however, depend o n the laws and 
regulations related t o the industry-in particular, the revised hyd roca rbon law ; po ten t ia l impac t 
o n the pub l ic referendum; the progress o f the imp lemen ta t ion by the government o f the 
government’s s ix p r i o r i t y p o l i t i c a l and economic objectives; and the l e v e l o f p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty in 
B o l i v i a . I n the case o f inves t ing in these projects, IFC w o u l d also p rov ide the projects w i t h 
international, social and environmental best practices t o ensure long - te rm sustainability and 
comm i tmen t f r o m d i f fe ren t stakeholders. In a larger project, IFC w o u l d exp lo re revenue sharing 
models in w h i c h revenue d is t r ibu t ion i s c lea r ly de f ined between the government, shareholders, 
employees, l o c a l communities; and other interested parties. In addition, the f inanc ing may en ta i l 
an Sh4E-linkage component t o strengthen the i r services t o larger enterprises. 
113. 
POWER. E v e n though B o l i v i a ’ s in f ras t ruc tu re sector has 
incorporated substantial p r iva te participation, B o l i v i a s t i l l needs substantial investment in this 
sector. W h i l e IFC’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in the sector during the CAS p e r i o d w o u l d depend la rge ly on 
the ove ra l l p o l i t i c a l and economic environment, and a stable regu la to ry f ramewo rk , IFC w o u l d 
selectively consider p r o v i d i n g support f o r a p r iva te sector p ro jec t in k e y areas such as power, as 
w e l l as telecommunications, transport, and water and sanitation. In a la rge r project, IFC may 
consider a pub l ic -p r iva te sector partnership mode l t o imp rove cost recove ry f o r p r iva te sector 
participants and reduce costs f o r consumers. 
114. SOCIAL SECTOR AND F INANC IAL MARKET . IFc w o u l d also consider selectively inves t ing 
in the social sector, pa r t icu la r ly in education. In the f inanc ia l market, IFC m a y complement the 
Bank efforts in im p r o v i n g regu la to ry and supervisory requirements w i t h technical assistance on 
governance and hous ing finance. IFC support w i l l especially be a imed at strengthening the risk 
assessmenumanagement capabilities o f selected 
ins t i tu t ions and re in fo rc ing corporate

H. Other Donor Assistance 

121. 
I n the immediate short term, other donors are also helping the government respond t o the 
crises of February and October 2003, through fast-disbursing budgetary support. Since the 
October crisis, the Andean Deve lopmen t Corporation (CAF ) has come fo rwa rd w i t h US$55 
m i l l i o n ; the Interamerican Deve lopmen t B a n k i s p rov id ing US$50 m i l l i o n f o r new projects and 
i s reassigning US$26 m i l l i o n o f i t s ex is t ing po r t fo l io ; the Netherlands i s p r o v i d i n g US $ 6 m i l l i o n 
and Denma rk US$3 m i l l i o n o f budgetary support; and U n i t e d States Agency f o r In te rna t iona l 
Deve lopmen t (USA ID ) i s advancing US$8 m i l l i o n f r o m i t s 2004 allocation. These activities 
complement the support p rov ided by the W o r l d Bank o f (i) the US $ 1 4 m i l l i o n Emergency 
Econom ic Recovery Credit; (ii) acceleration o f the US$10 m i l l i o n second tranche o f the ex is t ing 
Soc ia l Safety N e t SAC ; (iii) res t ruc tu r ing o f US$17 m i l l i o n f r o m the ex is t ing Ins t i tu t iona l 
R e f o rm Project; and ( iv ) a red i rec t ing o f US$5.7 m i l l i o n f r o m ex is t ing projects t o con f ron t 
problems in El A l t o and L a Paz. 
122. The government i s aware that i t w i l l n o t always be possible f o r the in te rna t iona l donors to 
respond to repeated emergencies. T h e government’s strategy (discussed p rev ious ly ) i s designed 
t o break the pattern o f repeated emergencies. G i v e n the current r ig id i t ies in the budget and the 
po ten t ia l d i f f icu l t ies in raising immed ia te ly domestic resources, the f inanc ing o f the p lan i s 
dependent upon external resources. Indeed, h ow the government manages the stocks and f l ow s 
of i t s entire external assistance i s c r i t ica l t o the task o f reso lv ing the immed ia te f isca l de f ic i t 
problems and getting back o n t rack t o meet i t s med ium - te rm objectives. W h i l e the W o r l d B a n k 
i s an impo r tan t actor, in 2002 i t accounted f o r o n l y 13.6 percent o f the to ta l gross disbursements, 
and a l ow e r percentage in terms o f ne t disbursements. 
123. Basic in fo rma t ion about the nature o f the entire p o r t f o l i o o f the donor commun i ty was 
co l lec ted as part o f the C A S preparation, th rough a j o i n t e f fo r t o f the W o r l d Bank , the IDB, and

are:

Ex te rna l assistance i s o f c r i t i c a l importance t o ove ra l l p u b l i c finances. T h e external 
assistance f r o m a l l agencies reached rough ly 10 percent o f GDP last year, and financed 
rough ly one - th i rd o f the p u b l i c budget (see Tab le E. 1 in Annex E). 
There are rough ly US$1 .6 b i l l i o n in undisbursed resources in ex is t ing projects and 
rough ly US$SOO m i l l i o n a year p ro jec ted in new f l ow s (see Tab le E .2 in Annex E). 
There i s substantial ine r t ia in the assignment o f external resources. The planned 
allocation o f resources f o r 2003 -06 l o o k ve ry s i m i l a r t o the actual a l loca t ion o f resources 
that were made between 1998 and 2001 (see Tab le E.3 in Annex E) 
The assistance p rov ided by the donor commun i ty i s scattered across too many projects. 
Ove r 1998-2002 there were 633 agreements signed between the government and the 
donor commun i ty that translated i n t o over 1,700 development projects (see Tab le E .4 in 
Annex E). 
124. 
Ove r time, i t w o u l d be advisable f o r the coun t ry t o s ign i f ican t ly reduce i t s dependence on 
the donor commun i ty . With such high levels o f external assistance, i t w o u l d appear that the leve l 
o f government i s high re la t ive t o wha t can be supported by domestic resources. W h i l e there may 

0 

35 

be several understandable explanations fo r how B o l i v i a came t o this position, the med ium - te rm 
strategy should be t o ac t ive ly reduce less-essential expenditures and raise the p ropo r t ion o f 
domestic f inanc ing w h i l e decreasing the percentage o f the pub l ic budget covered b y external 
assistance. 
125. 
I t w i l l be impo r tan t n o t t o treat this adjustment as a simple mechanical exercise, because 
there are some impo r tan t p o l i t i c a l economy elements at p lay . F o r example, i f B o l i v i a starts t o 
receive increased revenue f r o m gas, the donor commun i ty m a y take this as a signal t o reduce, 
dollar f o r dollar, i t s assistance. I f this were to happen, the ne t f isca l situation w o u l d rema in the 
same after in i t ia t ing the gas expo r t project as before. Assuming that the Gas Referendum turns 
ou t pos i t ive ly and that a v iab le market i s found f o r the na tu ra l gas project, there could, after all, 
be a backlash f r o m the general pub l ic w h o might feel that the gas export p ro jec t has y ie lded n o 
benefits. I t w o u l d be h e l p f u l i f the leve l o f external assistance c o u l d be b rough t down gradually, 
so that the gas export p ro jec t c o u l d y i e l d net pos i t ive results. 
I f over the m e d i um te rm the task should be t o g radua l ly bring d ow n the leve l o f external 
126. 
assistance, the m a i n task over the short term-that 
i s , over the f i r s t phase-should be t o change 
the m i x o f external assistance. Based o n the backg round analysis ca r r ied ou t f o r the CAS , i t 
appears that there w i l l be a substantial amount o f money available f o r B o l i v i a . The p rob lem i s 
that B o l i v i a has money t o d o what m a y n o longer be a p r i o r i t y , and does n o t have money t o 
cover the costs that i t must meet now . In particular, many o f the new f l ow s o f money are t o 
finance additional re fo rms and in i t ia t ives , when the past re fo rms have n o t had the i r costs fully 
covered. 
127. Business as usual i s n o t l i k e l y t o he lp B o l i v i a ou t o f i t s current problems. The first step i s 
f o r the donor commun i ty t o recognize that the founda t ion o n w h i c h they assumed they were 
building i s no t as so l id as they thought. I t i s no t as s o l i d because the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
reforms has been incomp le te o r p o o r l y executed in a numbe r o f cases, and the necessary 
f inanc ing underestimated. This l ies at the heart o f some o f the country’s current f isca l de f ic i t 
problems (together w i t h the loss in income as a result o f external and domestic shocks). 
128. The second step i s f o r the government t o l a y ou t a c red ib le p l a n that n o t o n l y addresses 
the short-term problems, but also lays ou t the end game that suggests h ow the coun t ry w i l l be 
getting back o n track in the medium t e rm . In the recent past, B o l i v i a has lu rched f r om crisis t o 
c r i s i s - e a c h t ime t r igge r ing a rush t o p rov ide r a p i d disbursing money w i t h ve ry few conditions 
because the government, in i t s weakened position, i s n o t in a pos i t ion t o deliver add i t iona l 
reforms. This p lan shou ld propose a mod i f ica t ion o f the use o f fu tu re f lows o f external 
assistance to: (i) ensure past re fo rms are adequately financed; and (ii) cover new h igh -p r io r i ty 
activities to reduce inequa l i ty and pove r ty through greater e f fo r ts t o he lp the poo r generate 
income. The p lan shou ld specify wha t efforts the coun t ry w i l l be m a k i n g t o mob i l ize mo re 
domestic resources and t o reduce less-essential expenditures. 
129. Despite the current uncertainty surrounding the m e d i um term, p r o v i d i n g such a p l a n i s 
critical, because the in te rna t iona l agencies need a f ramewo rk around w h i c h they can organize 
their much-needed assistance. G i v e n the f l u i d i t y o f the situation and the unexpected manner in 
wh ich the current administration came t o power, the donor commun i ty must anticipate hav ing t o 
w o r k w i t h r o l l i n g plans. Howeve r , i t w o u l d be ex t reme ly use fu l f o r there t o be a common v iew 
at any g iven time o f wha t i s the short-term and med ium - te rm p lan p reva i l ing at that moment. I t 
w o u l d also be useful t o k n ow when the nex t i te ra t ion i s l i k e l y t o come, so that the donor 

36 

commun i ty can take the necessary steps t o ensure that the r i g h t amount and right type o f 
assistance comes at the r i g h t time. 
130. The third step i s f o r this change in the future f l ow s o f external assistance t o take place. 
This w i l l n o t be easy f o r donor agencies, and w o u l d require strong leadership b y the government 
t o rev i ta l ize donor coordination and strengthen the development effectiveness o f the external 
assistance that B o l i v i a receives. 
131. 
REVITALIZING DONOR COORDINATION. 
The approach to donor coo rd ina t ion o f the 
BanzedQu i roga administration demonstrated b o t h the po ten t ia l and the d i f f icu l t ies associated 
w i t h imp lemen t ing the C D F p r inc ip les . Ove r the Sanchez de Lozada administration, some stress 
has been p laced o n donor coo rd ina t ion efforts-partly 
caused b y the pa r t icu la r ly d i f f i c u l t 
economic circumstances and the type o f r a p i d assistance requested by the government and pa r t ly 
caused b y a l ow e r l e v e l o f government emphasis o n donor coordination. G i v e n that the donor 
commun i ty has a po ten t ia l ly impo r tan t r o l e t o p l a y in getting B o l i v i a back o n t rack towards 
mee t ing i t s med ium - te rm development goals, 
tak ing decisive action t o rev i ta l ize donor 
coo rd ina t ion shou ld b e a p r i o r i t y f o r the government and the entire donor commun i ty , inc lud ing 
the W o r l d Bank . 
132. 
In the f i r s t months o f 2004, the b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l donors w i l l propose t o the 
government d i f fe ren t options f o r structuring donor assistance in a wo rkab le fashion. The 
government w o u l d re ta in i t s essential leadership r o l e by tak ing the f i n a l decision o n the structure 
that w o u l d best fac i l i ta te the c o o r d i n a t i o n - c h o o s i n g f r o m the d i f fe ren t options o r p ropos ing 
the i r own . Howeve r , the donor commun i ty w o u l d pursue a mo re p ro -ac t ive approach, rather 
than wa i t ing f o r the government t o develop f r o m scratch a new structure f o r coordination. 
133. The W o r l d B a n k w i l l participate ac t ive ly w i t h other donors in this e f f o r t t o rev i ta l ize 
donor coordination. The W o r l d B a n k c o u l d also take an active ro le in trying t o conv ince other 
donors that co r rec t ive action i s needed t o ensure the f inanc ia l sustainability o f ex is t ing reforms. 
This may take some analytical w o r k t o highlight what p o l i c y actions were taken and t o 
demonstrate that when summing up the costs o f a l l reforms, domestic resources were n o t 
su f f ic ien t t o cover the costs. The W o r l d B a n k c o u l d also w o r k w i t h other donors t o imp lemen t 
recommendations o f the PER and C F A A that w o u l d support the proposed p o r t f o l i o s h i f t s . A 
second immed ia te task f o r the government t o tack le w i t h the he lp o f a l l donors ( inc lud ing the 
W o r l d Bank ) i s t o address some o f the k e y imp lemen ta t ion problems. As many o f these 
problems are common across d i f fe ren t programs, they are bes t addressed th rough a j o i n t e f fo r t o f 
a l l donors. 
134. Once the government c la r i f ies i t s med ium - te rm objectives th rough the rev is ion o f the 
PRSP, tw o further tasks f o r the government and the donor commun i ty w i l l be (i) t o a l ign the 
p o r t f o l i o o f the donor commun i ty t o the rev ised PRSP, and (ii) t o consolidate over 1,700 projects 
i n t o a mo re manageable number o f programs. There i s considerable interest in harmonization, 
and some b i la te ra l agencies are tak ing a lead ing ro le . Other k e y tasks relate t o the ove ra l l 
harmonization agenda com ing ou t o f the High L e v e l F o r um in Rome. These add i t iona l activities 
might include: 

135. HARMONIZATION OF PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES AROUND NAT IONAL NORMS. The 

objective w i l l be f o r a l l agencies t o use B o l i v i a no rms in place o f the i r o w n f o r contracting, 
independently o f whether the ac t iv i ty i s f inanced b y external o r domestic resources. The 
government has recen t ly made improvements t o the B o l i v i a n norms, bringing them closer t o

international standards. They ‘ w i l l b e wo rk ing closely w i t h a l l agencies t o iden t i fy and resolve 
rema in ing objections t o the use o f national norms. F o r some agencies, i t m a y p rove impossible 
t o to ta l ly accept the B o l i v i a n norms, but there w i l l b e an attempt t o keep differences t o a 

minimum. 

136. GREATER COLLABORAT ION TO REDUCE TRANSACTIONS COSTS OF RECE IV ING ASSISTANCE. 

There are a variety o f actions, rang ing f r o m common f inanc ing o f i n f o rm a t i o n systems that serve 
the interests o f a l l t o j o i n t supervision t o more effective transmission o f knowledge f r om 
headquarters t o the coun t ry where the government (and m a n y o f the donors) feel that better 
organization and realization o f economies o f scale w o u l d have h i g h payoffs. 

I. Beyond the current CAS period 

137. As the pe r iod covered by this C A S i s re la t ive ly short, i t may be use fu l t o p rov ide some 
ind ica t ion o f the type o f projects that m i g h t be supported in the nex t C A S period. As mentioned 
previously, there are tw o possible scenarios f o r B o l i v i a f o l l ow i n g the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly- 
an op t im is t ic scenario (w i t h a successful outcome o f the Gas Re fe rendum and Cons t i tu t iona l 
Assembly, a rev ised PRSP in place, some f isca l adjustment done in an economically, p o l i t i c a l l y 
and soc ia l ly viable way and social peace) and a pessimistic scenario (where B o l i v i a heads i n t o a 
v ic ious cycle in wh ich poo r economic decisions generate mo re social unrest that, in tum, reduces 
the chances o f generating income f o r the poor). 
138. Under the op t im is t ic scenario, the W o r l d B a n k w o u l d a l ign i t s p rog ram closely w i t h the 
rev ised PRSP. As the rev ised PRSP w i l l undoubtedly have a strong focus o n generating income 
opportunities f o r the poor, i t i s highly l ike ly that the W o r l d B a n k w o u l d develop projects t o 
support this objective. Pa r t icu la r ly impo r tan t w o u l d be the poo r t o bene f i t f r o m trade. G iven the 
sma l l size o f the domestic economy, the ab i l i ty t o generate labo r intensive exports w i l l be c ruc ia l 
f o r Bo l iv ia ’s development. The design o f these projects w o u l d build u p o n related ESW carried

J. CAS Consultations 

140. As part o f the preparation o f the CAS , fou r consultations took place in d i f fe ren t regions 
o f the country-in 
the highlands (Potosi), the low lands (Santa Cruz), the valleys (Tarija) and the 
Amazon (Riberalta). T w o consultations were carried ou t p r i o r t o the October 2003 social 
con f l ic t and t w o after. I n total, during the fou r fora, around 256 representatives o f urban and 
ru ra l organizations, indigenous, ayllus, youth, women, NGOs, universities, “juntas vecinales,” 
“comite‘s de v ig i lanc ia y c o n t r o l social,” sma l l and m e d i um entrepreneurs, unions, c i v i c 
committees, etc. participated. O n average, 39 percent o f the participants were women and 6 1 
percent men. 

Main observations f r o m the San ta C r u z and Tarija f o r a (before Oc tobe r social conflict): 

High degree o f pessimism about the country’s current s i tua t ion and i t s future; 
L a c k o f confidence in the government’s ab i l i ty t o administer in te rna t iona l donor funds; 
Strong c r i t ic ism o f acts o f co r rup t ion at a l l three leve ls o f government-national, 
departmental, and mun ic ipa l ; 
Desire that there be m o r e direct transfers o f resources t o commun i t ies as a way t o reach 
the poor; 
Considerable va r ia t ion across organizations in the extent o f the i r know ledge and in the i r 
opinions concerning the Na t iona l D ia logue 2000, plans f o r the Na t iona l D ia logue 2003, 
the Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy and the mechanisms o f social control;. 
Widespread c r i t i c i sm o f the “Comites de V ig i lanc ia ” (mun ic ipa l - leve l c i t izen oversight 
committees). Some participants fe l t that the oversight committees had been co-opted b y 
loca l politicians; 

39 

Strong demand f o r increased decentralization; 
C r i t i c i sm o f the government f o r no t do ing mo re to support the p roduc t ive sector, 
comb ined w i t h requests that the W o r l d B a n k do mo re in this area. Surprisingly, few 
participants l i n k e d the expected revenues f r o m gas t o an ab i l i ty t o be able t o p rov ide 
mo re assistance; 
Participants tended t o generalize. A l though there were a w ide group o f organizations 
represented in the fora, they appeared t o have l i t t l e in the way o f specific proposals about 
what t o do; and 
NGO s tended t o be mo re c r i t ica l o f the W o r l d B a n k and donor assistance, in general, 
whereas campesino (peasant) organizations tended t o take a mo re pragmatic position, 
asking wha t mo re c o u l d be done t o receive f inanc ia l and technical assistance. 

Ma in observat ions f r o m R i b e r a l t a and Po tos i f o r a ( a f t e r Oc tobe r soc ia l conf l ict):

0 

0 The t w o regions had d i f fe ren t perspectives about the country’s new situation. There was 
considerably mo re op t im ism expressed in R ibe ra l ta (Amazonia) than Po tos i (highlands). 
Participants in R ibe ra l ta f e l t that w i t h the changes o f October mo re spaces had been 
opened f o r c i v i l pa r t ic ipa t ion and that the new administration should be g iven t ime t o 
complete i t s agenda. Participants in Potosi f e l t that there had o n l y been a change in the 
administration, but that there had n o t been any m a j o r substantive change. 
In b o t h regions there was a strong demand f o r mo re in fo rma t ion about the plans f o r the 
Gas Referendum and the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly; 
In Potosi, the general v i ew was that there was hardly any need f o r a Gas Referendum, as 
in the i r mind the issues had been settled as an outcome o f the October con f l ic t . They f e l t 
that the use o f gas shou ld be guaranteed f o r a l l that i t should be used f i r s t t o he lp 
indus t r ia l ize the coun t ry and o n l y after domestic uses had been exp lo i ted should i t be 
exported. In Riberalta, the participants were in favo r o f hav ing a Gas Re fe rendum as 
they fe l t c i v i l society should participate in the de f in i t ion o f po l icy . Participants were 
mo re supportive o f expo r t ing gas, but men t ioned that there should social con t ro l t o ensure 
that the gas benefits, in a equitable way, the development o f the p roduc t ive sectors, hea l th 
and education; 
In Potosi, participants fe l t that the Cons t i tu t iona l Assembly should i n v o l v e a deep and 
b road analysis o f the Cons t i tu t ion w i t h the ob jec t ive o f making s ign i f ican t changes. In 
Riberalta, the participants f e l t that changes were needed t o grant greater autonomy t o 
each reg ion and t o a l low h ighe r levels o f direct pa r t ic ipa t ion in decision-making 
processes; 
As in Santa Cruz and Tarija, there was a c a l l f o r mo re direct transfer o f resources t o 
regions, communities and organizations as a w a y t o achieve better results; and 
Participants in b o t h R ibe ra l ta and Po tos i f e l t that there should be a mo re equitable 
d is t r ibu t ion o f resources, especially land.

In considering the imp l ica t ions o f these consultations f o r the preparation o f this C A S and, 
especially, f o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S go ing forward, a number o f po in ts stand out. 
First, there was universal recogn i t ion that B o l i v i a i s in a ve ry d i f f i c u l t situation. There was also 
mo re o r less general agreement w i t h the W o r l d Bank ’s read ing o f the situation (described in this 
C A S and shared w i t h participants at the fora). Second, there appear t o be strong differences in 

40 

views held in the d i f fe ren t regions, wh ich may come t o the fo re f ron t around discussions o f the 
Constitutional Assembly. Third, the re was a concern about co r rup t ion at a l l levels o f 
government. Manag ing resources at the mun ic ipa l level, closer t o the citizens, was n o t seen as 
be ing necessarily better in terms o f corruption-largely 
because the c i t izen oversight committees 
were no t seen as func t ion ing w e l l in practice. M a k i n g the mechanisms o f social con t ro l mo re 
effective w i l l be an impo r tan t challenge f o r the coun t ry in the com ing years. Fourth, there was 
strong interest in hav ing mo re resources managed d i rec t ly by the commun i ty . This w i l l be done 
w i t h i n the W o r l d Bank ’s ex is t ing Participatory R u r a l Deve lopmen t P ro jec t and in the proposed 
Spatial Ru ra l DevelopmentICommunity-driven development project. Fifth, there was universal 
demand f o r the government (and the donor commun i ty ) t o pay mo re attention t o supporting the 
productive sectors. This w i l l be done w i t h the new p rog ram o f projects and ESW in this CAS , 
w i t h the expectation o f f o l l ow - u p in the nex t C A S period. F ina l ly , there was universal demand 
f o r the W o r l d B a n k and the government t o demonstrate what results had been achieved w i t h the 
assistance and an almost palpable thirst f o r in fo rma t ion , pa r t icu la r ly among the you th 
representatives at the f o r a . The W o r l d B a n k Coun t ry O f f i c e has recen t ly ins t i tu ted a Pub l ic 
In fo rma t ion Center (PIC) and has made in fo rma t ion o n i t s projects available in Spanish, 
Quechua, Ayma ra and Guarani. Con t inued e f fo r ts o n dissemination and o n consultation are 
needed. 

K. Environmental Issues 

142. The success in long - te rm sustainable development w i l l depend o n the ab i l i ty o f future 
development po l ic ies and pove r ty reduc t ion programs t o fully integrate env i ronmen ta l i s s u e s and 
t o focus o n the sustainable use o f na tu ra l resources. 
143. Bo l iv ia ’s economy i s , and w i l l rema in in the near future, highly dependent o n the 
exp lo i ta t ion o f i t s na tu ra l resource base (see k e y environmental indicators in Annex I). The 
modalities o f use o f these resources, and the ins t i tu t iona l and regulatory aspects associated w i t h 
these patterns o f use, determine opportunities t o p romo te growth, but can also be responsible f o r 
most o f i t s limiting factors, because they can d i rec t ly in tens i fy the pove r ty levels o f the 
population, i f inappropriate. T w o impo r tan t challenges in the development agenda o f the 
upcom ing decade are: (i) the need t o expand the po ten t ia l o f the natural resource base t o p romo te 
growth, and (ii) the need t o a v o i d negative env i ronmen ta l impacts f r o m p roduc t ive activities, 
wh ich w i l l d i rec t ly a f fec t the l i v e l i h o o d o f the poor. P roduc t ive sectors l i k e agriculture, 
irrigation, energy, and fo res t ry have s t i l l untapped po ten t ia l t o generate g r ow t h i f the binding 
factors limiting the sustainable use o f these resources are addressed (pa r t icu la r ly in re la t ion t o the 
l im i t e d access t o p roduc t ive , human, and f inanc ia l assets, and t o imp roved technologies and 
infrastructure). A good example o f this available po ten t ia l i s seen in the B o l i v i a n forests and 
their successful ce r t i f ica t ion program, where today o n l y 20 percent o f the to ta l p roduc t ive forests 
are managed sustainably. 
144. The up - f ron t consideration o f environmental aspects in mos t sectoral activities i s also 
essential t o reduce pove r ty and enhance many o f the coun t ry ’s human development indicators 
and Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals. As such, in f ras t ruc tu re investments p lanned t o enhance 
hydrocarbon, 
industry, and agriculture activities need 
t o b e accompanied by honest 
environmental assessments and ea r ly p lann ing t o con t ro l emissions and a v o i d po ten t ia l con f l ic ts 
in land use. Env i ronmen ta l safeguards should be inco rpo ra ted in health programs t o m i n im i z e 

41 

the emp loymen t o f pers is ten t organic pollutants and carcinogens in malaria-and 
other 
p a r a s i t e s - c o n t r o l plans, and in the mon i to r ing of water systems feeding urban and ru ra l areas, t o 
con t ro l impacts f r o m m i n i n g activities on i n d i v i d u a l health and agriculture production. 
145. G i v e n that most o f the p roduc t ive activities in the coun t ry (mining, agriculture, industry) 
are h i g h l y water dependent, a third impo r tan t challenge in the development agenda o f the 
coun t ry refers t o the use and management o f water resources. 
I s s u e s requ i r ing pa r t icu la r 
attention relate t o the enhancement o f water ava i lab i l i ty in the drought-prone areas o f the center 
and southeast, management o f the water cycle in the Amazon ian valleys, regulations t o address 
con f l ic t ing uses and the i r cross impacts, and enforcement o f regulations t o con t ro l p o l l u t i o n 
effects. Sanitation i s also a ma jo r issue on the agenda, pa r t icu la r ly in ru ra l areas, where o n l y 35 
percent o f the households have access t o potable water. 
146. Fu tu re pove r ty reduc t ion efforts should foster the environment-development in teg ra t ion 
process, and make the environment, and the natural resource base, an engine t o promote g row th . 
This can o n l y be achieved by encouraging a cu l tu re that favors public-private partnerships and 
dialogue, by i d e n t i f y i n g loca l solutions and p r o v i d i n g responses t o sustainable development 
in i t ia t ives at the loca l level, by deve lop ing resource-based income streams f o r the poor, and by 
adjusting the cu l tu re and the patterns o f development, production, and consumption, wh ich w i l l 
in turn requ i re transformations in value systems, attitudes, and social behavior. 

L. Gender Issues 

147. Ove r the last decade, the government has placed greater emphasis o n t rack ing indicators 
related t o gender, especially w i t h regard t o education, health, and the labor market. 
148. 
In education, the gap between boys and girls has na r rowed at the p r ima ry level, but 
disparities rema in at the secondary level. The ra t io o f girls t o boys in p r ima ry education hove red 
around 100 percent, w h i l e the average years o f schooling stands at 8.44 f o r men and 6.81 f o r 
women. D ispa r i t ies also remain between urban and ru ra l areas (see Tab le 9 ) .

149. O n the health front, the recently launched Seguro Universal M a t em o Znfantil ( S U M I ) i s 
tack l ing mother and c h i l d health care. There i s a l o n g way t o go in im p r o v i n g l i v i n g standards, 
especially f o r women l i v i n g in ru ra l areas. F o r instance, in the r u r a l area mo re than 7 4 percent o f 
newborns were attended by uns lu l led s ta f f in 2001. 

42 

150. With regard t o the p roduc t ive sector, there i s a ma jo r bias against women regarding 
entrance i n t o the labor market. When turning 25, mo re than 90 percent o f men are pa r t o f the 
workforce, in contrast t o 70 percent o f women. In addition, ma jo r differences in salaries rema in 
between women and men. 
151. The government i s addressing gender disparities b y imp lemen t ing a series o f po l ic ies that 
recognizes the difference in responsibilities and roles that women and men face at the d i f fe ren t 
stages o f their lives. Pub l ic po l ic ies w i l l focus o n ru ra l areas, since disparities there are mo re 
evident than in urban areas. 

M. Procurement 

152. Reforms o f the p u b l i c contracting system in B o l i v i a aim at strengthening the current lega l 
and ins t i tu t iona l procurement f ramewo rk in a manner consistent w i t h in te rna t iona l procurement 
standards and practices in order t o ensure increased conditions o f transparency, economy, and 
e f f ic iency in management o f pub l ic procurement, reduc ing levels o f co r rup t ion in the pub l ic 
sector, and p rov id ing sustainability t o imp lemen ted reforms. 
153. Ha rmon iza t ion o f po l ic ies and procedures i s a k e y objective o f procurement re fo rms in 
B o l i v i a . The Government o f B o l i v i a and the B a n k have discussed this issue along w i t h the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the agreed A c t i o n P lan o f the Coun t ry Procurement Assessment Report 
(CPAR ) w i t h a v iew t o ach iev ing such objective through: (i) preparation o f m o d em procurement 
leg is la t ion compatible w i th in te rna t iona l standards and practices, i n c l u d i n g the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f a na t iona l regulatory agency and a Code o f E th ics f o r pub l ic procurement staff; (ii) gradual 
imp lemen ta t ion o f an e-government procurement system; and (iii) issuing o f adequate loca l 
standards procedures and adoption o f standardized l o c a l bidding documents at a l l levels o f 
government. 
154. Ove ra l l procurement risk assessment o f B o l i v i a i s rated as high, although s ign i f ican t 
imp rovemen t has been achieved in the C D F con tex t by a ma jo r i ty o f p ro jec t - imp lemen t ing 
agencies. Assigned risk assessment leve l i s due m a i n l y t o a l im i t e d ins t i tu t iona l capacity f o r

procurement staff in a number o f agencies t o ca r ry ou t procurement func t ions and tasks in an 
e f f ic ien t manner; and the need t o in t roduce m o d em and streamlined coun t ry procurement 
po l ic ies and procedures. 

N. Financial Management 

155. An assessment o f the f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty arrangements o f the B o l i v i a p u b l i c sector 
was conducted b y the B a n k in 1999. The repo r t concluded that (i) the government systems did 
n o t p rov ide reliable i n f o rm a t i o n su f f ic ien t t o p e rm i t an evaluation o f the government’s 
performance; (ii) the Supreme Audit Ins t i tu t ion (CGR) did n o t report o n the government’s 
annual f inanc ia l statements; and (iii) there was a l a c k o f con t ro l o f government-owned f i x e d 
assets. 
156. O n the basis o f the 1999 C F A A , the government and the B a n k agreed t o a f inanc ia l 
imp rovemen t action plan, the ma jo r i t em s o f w h i c h were inc luded among the benchmarks o f the 

F i rs t Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (PSAC-I), and inc luded (i) the unambiguous 

application o f the Supreme Decree that related t o the Integrated F inanc ia l Management Systems 

43 

(SIGMA), and (ii) a comm i tmen t t o achieve agreed minimum benchmarks in f inanc ia l 
management in a l l central government ministries through the imp lemen ta t ion o f SIGMA. 
157. A rev iew o f the advances against benchmarks se t in the PSAC - I , conducted in December 
2001, ind ica ted that S I G M A became operational in a l l central government m i n i s t r i e s . This 
imp lemen ta t ion n ow facilitates re l iab le repo r t ing o f budget execution. 
In addition, data on 
government expenditure has been made available t o the pub l ic , through the Internet. During 
2002, S I G M A also began operating in some decentralized entities, inc lud ing FPS and the 
Na t iona l Customs Service. However, the scope and operations o f S I G M A need t o be expanded 
t o the rest o f the decentralized entities and regional (prefectures) and mun ic ipa l levels in order t o 
contribute t o the comp le t ion o f one o f the ma jo r recommendations o f the C F A A . 
158 . The Government o f B o l i v i a has demonstrated i t s comm i tmen t t o decentralization and 
popular pa r t ic ipa t ion in loca l governance, as guiding p r inc ip les f o r the r e f o rm o f the country’s 
pub l ic administration. An an t iconup t ion strategy and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm (fundamentally linked 
t o the an t iconup t ion battle) are high on the government’s agenda. E f f o r t s are be ing made t o 
c l a r i f y roles, responsibilities, and f isca l and f inanc ia l relations among d i f fe ren t levels o f pub l ic 
administration (national, prefectural, and municipal). 
159. F r o m the D o n o r perspective, the W o r l d B a n k and other f inanc ing agencies have seen 
their business change considerably in recent years. The re la t ive increase in adjustment lending, 
debt re l ie f and sector programs, in place o f t rad i t iona l investment projects has reduced the 
re la t ive importance o f t rac lung ind iv idua l bo r rowe r transactions as a source o f f iduc ia ry 
assurance and h igh l igh ted the importance o f assessing the country’s o w n Pub l ic F inanc ia l 
Management (PFM) system. Meanwh i le , the increasing emphasis by donors o n wo r lung w i th , 
and imp rov ing , government ins t i tu t ions and systems, has ind ica ted a need t o better understand 
opportunities f o r enhancing pub l ic sector performance, and thus reduc ing f iduc ia ry risk. 
160. There i s add i t iona l ly a demand f r o m the pub l ic f o r increased government transparency 
and accountability. This i s expressed through c i t izen and p o l i t i c a l groups, w h i c h have gained 
significant strength in B o l i v i a over the past several years. 
161. B o l i v i a has been iden t i f ied as one o f the P i lo ts f o r Harmonization. Therefore, during the 
CAS period, efforts w i l l be in tens i f ied t o harmonize operational po l ic ies at the ins t i tu t iona l and 
country leve l in order t o enhance effectiveness and e f f ic iency and p romo te greater coun t ry 
ownership. These e f fo r ts w i l l be guided by directives l a i d d ow n by the Organisation f o r 
Econom ic Co-operation and Development-Development Assistance Comm i t tee (OECD -DAC ) 
Task Force o n donor practices. C r i t ica l t o the success o f this i n i t i a t i v e w o u l d be the 
government’s comm i tmen t t o lead the agenda and the engagement o f a c r i t ica l mass o f coun t ry -

162. Further coo rd ina t ion i s proposed through a j o i n t diagnostic rev iew o f p r iva te sector 
accounting practices, lead ing t o iden t i f ica t ion o f opportunities f o r capacity building in the 
accounting profession. 
I n addition, in response t o ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses observed in some 
imp lemen t ing agencies, ins t i tu t iona l development grants w i l l be a k e y instrument in capacity 
building. 
163. 
I n v iew o f a possible increase in noninvestment lending in the p o r t f o l i o b y the B a n k and

11. Production in p r io r i ty export chains (in 
m i l l ions o f US$ ) 
12. Production in p r io r i ty employment-generation 
chains (thousands o f jobs) 

166. The government has made an i n i t i a l attempt t o estimate the costs o f reaching the targets, 
and presents tw o sets o f estimates. One assumes that 60 percent o f the target w i l l be reached, 
and the other that 100 percent o f the target w i l l be reached, b y 2015. T h e me thodo logy and 
assumptions used f o r the estimates are described in the government document. The state o f the 
ar t in estimating f inanc ing requirements f o r mee t ing MDGs does n o t a l l ow f o r a great deal o f 
precision-in 
either B o l i v i a o r in other countries. Thus, the estimates shou ld be taken as 
ba l lpa rk figures, subject t o later rev is ion . 
167. No tw i ths tand ing these caveats, the best estimates that the government has at this t ime 
suggest that the costs o f ach iev ing 100 percent o f the social goals w o u l d run around US$1.4 
b i l l i o n a year, and the costs o f reaching 100 percent o f the p roduc t ive sector goals w o u l d run 
around US$1.1 b i l l i o n a year. T h e to ta l o f US$2.5 b i l l i o n a year i s ove r f o u r times the average 
amount o f external resources rece ived by B o l i v i a during 1998-2001, and around th ree t imes that 
received in 2002, wh ich was a reco rd year. Clearly, the f inanc ing gap dwa r fs the amount o f 
external resources l i k e l y t o be available. The government w o u l d be able t o advance aggressively 
towa rd their MDG targets o n l y i f considerably higher levels o f concessional f inanc ing were 
available in the future than has been made available in the past.

168. The rev ised PRSP carries ou t a second exercise that iden t i f ies the desired re la t ive 
allocation across p roduc t ive investments (roughly 59 percent o f to ta l investment), p roduc t ion 
chains and l o c a l economic development (1 3 percent), and social sector investments (28 percent). 
I n mak ing this re la t ive allocation, the government estimates pe r capita expenditures t o increase 
progressively f r o m US$607 m i l l i o n in 2003 t o US$713 m i l l i o n in 2007. 
169. The government recognizes that in order t o achieve na t iona l targets, i t w i l l be necessary 
t o se t mun ic ipa l targets, since imp lemen ta t ion o f po l ic ies i s carried ou t in a considerably 
decentralized setting. The government has proposed t o cond i t ion part o f the intergovernmental 
transfers f r o m the central l e v e l t o mun ic ipa l i t ies o n e f fo r ts made by the mun ic ipa l i t ies t o achieve 
na t iona l goals. I f a mun ic ipa l i ty has poo r indicators in, say in fan t mo r ta l i ty , and i s n o t tak ing 
steps t o address the problem, they w o u l d find themselves w i t h less resources. This cond i t ion ing 
should also have the effect o f im p r o v i n g the results o r ien ta t ion and generating faster 
achievement o f the targets. I t i s n o t clear whether this approach w i l l s t i l l be pursued after the 
change in administration. 
170. T w o other impo r tan t steps that the government proposes t o take over the upcom ing CAS 
pe r iod are: (i) conso l ida t ing the over 1,700 development projects i n t o a reduced numbe r o f 
approximately 100 projects (this should make i t easier t o set a manageable number o f targets); 
and (ii) the ca r ry ing ou t o f a p i l o t test o f a mun ic ipa l l e v e l in fo rma t ion system (w i t h the support 
o f the W o r l d Bank), w i t h the expectation that this w o u l d soon be r o l l e d out in a l l mun ic ipa l i t ies 
in the country. 
171. F ina l ly , i t i s rea l is t ic t o acknowledge that i t w i l l be a numbe r o f years before a results- 
based management approach w i l l take h o l d in B o l i v i a . Some other k e y elements that are needed 
(and that are n o t yet in place) include: 
Im p r o v e d data and in fo rma t ion systems-particularly 
at the mun ic ipa l leve l . 
Deve lopmen t o f systematic approaches to link p o l i c y actions t o results12. 
Fo rmu la t ion o f adequate intermediate targets t o orient decisions in the p roduc t ive sector 
(this lags behind advances in the social sectors). 
Wo rkab le approaches t o a t t r ibu t ing the con t r ibu t ion o f the actions o f a pa r t icu la r agency 
t o a particular result. 
Reorientation o f the budgetary a l loca t ion system t o ensure that f inanc ia l resources f l o w t o 
k e y bottlenecks that stand in the way o f ach iev ing results. 
Im p r o v e d donor coo rd ina t ion and greater ha rmon iza t ion o f procedures in order t o p rov ide

f o l l ow f r om de l ive r ing results-rather 
than f r o m p o l i t i c a l patronage. 
M u c h greater transparency o f government programs, and transparency o f expenditures

A champion w i t h i n government t o promote a results-based management approach. 
Greater f am i l i a r i t y o f and s k i l l w i t h evidence-based advocacy o n the pa r t o f the pub l ic .

173. This C A S i s be ing prepared during a pe r iod o f considerable d i f f icu l t ies and uncertainty in

through this d i f f i c u l t t ime i s impo r tan t and this i s n o t ime t o disengage. B a n k management 
proposes a strong package o f f inanc ia l assistance and rap id ly delivered technical assistance t o be 
delivered under a C A S that w o u l d cover t w o years, FY04 and FY05. This support w o u l d be 
aligned c lose ly w i t h the government’s p rog ram and, together w i t h the continued implementation 
o f the ex is t ing po r t fo l io , the new programs w o u l d he lp the coun t ry address problems o f 
exclusion, inequality, pove r ty and f isca l imbalance.

A. Th e Base l ine S c en a r io 

1. 
The baseline scenario assumes a conservative macro f ramewo rk . Rates o f output g row th 
are lowe r than those emp loyed in the scenario the Government and the IMF have agreed upon 
under the current I M F ’ s Standby Agreement. 
In particular, i t i s assumed that w i thou t a gas 
export project, the rea l GDP g row th converges t o 3.6 percent (this f igu re be ing the average 
g row th rate f o r 1990-2002, this pe r iod includes economic b o om o f mid 1990’s and the ongo ing 
economic crisis that s ta r ted in 1999).’ This scenario takes i n t o account the programmed W o r l d 
Bank support t o B o l i v i a presented in this document. I t i s assumed that b o t h the W o r l d Bank’s 
and the other creditors’ graduation o f concessional credits s t a r t s progressively in 2004. Expo r ts 
and FDI i n f l ow s shou ld be less buoyant that in previous scenarios, i t i s assumed that a gas export 
project w o u l d s t a r t in 2008. Ex te rna l capital f l ow s are assumed t o decrease in 2003 and 2004 
recovering modes t ly afterwards; FDI increases f r o m 2008 due t o the gas expo r t project. O n the 
fiscal front, a progressive f isca l adjustment i s assumed t o take place ove r the 2004-08 period. 
The baseline scenario ru les ou t the poss ib i l i ty o f a f inanc ia l crisis o r generalized social con f l ic ts .

In the baseline scenario to ta l debt stock indicators do n o t show an exp los ive pattern (see 
Figure C2.1). The stock o f debt t o GDP deteriorates until 2005, reaching a l e v e l o f 80.6 percent, 

1. In the very short run, despite the decline in domestic demand (ma in ly due to the d i f f i c u l t social and po l i t ica l 
situation), exports are lead ing economic growth: the hydrocarbon sector sustained i t s performance, agriculture 
produc t ion (ma in ly due to soybeans) increased and textiles produc t ion recovered. 
I n the medium-term, rea l 
output w i l l be pos i t ive ly affected b y the recovery o f B raz i l ’s gas demand (as curren t ly projected). Th is wou ld 
increase prospects fo r increasing gas exports to B raz i l . Currently, gas exports stand at on ly about 13.5 M M m 3 
per day, wh i le the take o r pay clause o f the Gas Supply Agreement has already reached 18 M M m 3 per day.

are lower, export g row th i s s ign i f ican t ly reduced. Other external f inanc ing assumptions are the

The outcome o f alternative scenarios i s presented in Figure C2.2 and Tables C2.2 t o

sustainability i s achieved; g iven the current social and p o l i t i c a l situation this f isca l adjustment

ANNEX E: BOLIVIA CAS - INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATION ASSISTANCE 

1. 
Bas ic in fo rma t ion about the nature o f the en t i re p o r t f o l i o o f the In te rna t iona l 
Cooperation was collected as part o f the C A S preparation, through a j o i n t e f fo r t o f the W o r l d 
Bank, IDB and the Government. This in fo rma t ion i s based o n an extensive canvassing o f the 
m a i n agencies w o r k i n g in B o l i v i a , tak ing i n t o account the i r plans f o r the pe r iod 2003-2006. 
Some o f the impo r tan t findings f r o m that study are as fo l lows : 

External assistance is of critical importance to overall public finances. 

2. 
Ex te rna l assistance reached rough ly 10 percent o f GDP last year and f inanced rough ly 
one third o f the pub l ic budget. The to ta l i s mo re that a l l pub l ic investment. The Government 
resorted t o increased f inanc ing f r o m C A F in 2002 t o finance part o f the f isca l de f ic i t . 
Disbursements f r o m a l l sources in 2002 reached US$784 m i l l i o n compared t o an average o f 
US$572 m i l l i o n in the previous years. C A F disbursements in 2002 were US$278 m i l l i o n , 
rough ly US$200 m i l l i o n mo re than their average o f the previous three years. T h e levels o f 
assistance p rov ided b y d i f fe ren t agencies are presented be low in Table E.1. There are r o u g h l y 
US$1.6 b i l l i o n in undisbursed resources in ex is t ing projects and rough ly US$SOO m i l l i o n a year

The projected new f l ow s represent a significant increase over wha t B o l i v i a received over 
the 1998-2001, wh ich was around US$572 m i l l i o n . This increase i s la rge ly due t o increases o f 
the multilaterals, rather than the bilaterals. Table E.2 shows how the current stock o f projects are 
distributed and where new resources are expected t o be allocated. There i s considerable ine r t ia 
in the system. The planned allocation o f resources f o r the pe r iod 2003-06 looks ve ry similar to 
the actual allocation o f resources that were made between 1998 and 2001

Table E.3 contrasts p lanned expenditures over 
disbursements over the 1998-01 period. 
The planned allocations represent the aggregation o f decisions taken independently by 
the different agencies. Because the o r ig ina l PRSP did n o t specify detailed p r io r i t ies , v i r tua l ly a l l 
donor activities were considered t o be consistent w i t h the strategy. Thus, n o reo r ien ta t ion o f the 
p o r t f o l i o to the PRSP took place between 2001 and 2003. 
6. 
Some i n i t i a l observations o n planned expenditures over the 2003-06 pe r iod that are 
wo r th no t ing inc lude the f o l l ow i n g . The amount projected t o be spent in education in the future 
(2003-06) i s less than in the past and i s l ow e r (at 6 percent o f to ta l external resources) than one 
m igh t expect g iven i t s importance. A high percentage o f past and future external resources are 
spent on ins t i tu t iona l strengthening ( rough ly 17 percent o r projected f o r 2003-06, some US$500 
m i l l ion ) . One cou ld ce r ta in ly question whether there has been su f f ic ien t progress t o show f o r the 
amount spent (largely in pay ing salaries). Re la t ive ly small amounts are projected f o r

The sheer numbers o f projects complicates greatly the task o f generating a results 
orientation. Even i f one were t o assume that each project has o n l y one ob jec t ive (wh ich typ ica l ly 
i s n o t the case), this w o u l d imply that the Government i s t r y i n g t o achieve at least 1,700 
objectives. Obv ious ly , this i s infeasible.

Introduction 

Annex G 

The last full Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) f o r B o l i v i a was designed t o cover f i v e years 
(FY98 -FY02 ) so as t o co inc ide w i t h the te rm o f the then-newly-elected Government o f H u g o 
Banzer. 
I t was en t i re ly aligned w i t h the government’s development p l a n except f o r the 
component re la t ing t o coca eradication p o l i c y where the B a n k decided t o n o t be active because i t 
does n o t have a comparative advantage in the area. In M a y 2001, in light o f tw o impo r tan t 
developments that w o u l d have an impac t on the Bank ’s assistance-the 
in t roduc t ion o f the 
Comprehensive Deve lopmen t F ramewo rk (CDF) and the preparation o f Bo l iv ia ’s Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP)-a C A S Progress Repo r t was presented t o the Board. The 
C A S Progress Repo r t presented a planned lending p rog ram f o r F Y 0 3 that inc luded new actions 
t o make the Bank ’s p rog ram consistent w i t h the PRSP. 

This annex looks back at the coun t ry p lann ing process and the achievement o f coun t ry results 
and CAS outcomes ove r the last C A S pe r iod (1998-2002). 
I t also assesses the performance o f 
the B a n k during the p rev ious C A S pe r iod in t e rm s o f the qua l i ty o f i t s products and services, the 
de l ive ry o f i t s lend ing and technical assistance p rog ram and the status o f the po r t fo l io . Ove r the 
last years, the B a n k has wo rked c lose ly w i t h other donors t o support the government’s program. 
Thus, this report presents some o f the impo r tan t findings f r o m an Operations Eva lua t ion 
Department (OED) assessment o f the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C D F in B o l i v i a , w h i c h a l lowed the 
B a n k t o p l a y an impo r tan t r o l e in the donor coo rd ina t ion e f fo r t . I t also reports o n the extensive 
consultation process that cu lm ina ted in the preparation o f the country’s PRSP, wh ich was f u l l y 
supported by the Bank . This repo r t concludes by presenting a b r i e f assessment o f the 
performance o f the CAS . 

A. 

Country Planning Process 

F o l l ow i n g a na t ion -w ide pa r t ic ipa to ry process that b rough t together government and c i v i l society 
representatives in 1997 (known as the First N a t i o n a l Dialogue), the Banzer Adm in is t ra t ion 
developed a Na t iona l A c t i o n P lan f o r the 1997-2002 period. T h e p lan was a comprehensive 
strategy structured a round fou r pillars-dignity, 
equity, ins t i tu t iona l i ty and opportunity- 
designed t o deal w i t h coca eradication, imp rove social indicators and reduce inequa l i ty , p romo te 
ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm and foster economic g row th and reduce pove r ty . 
I t i d e n t i f i e d the mos t 
impo r tan t development challenges and possible actions t o address them. 

In 1997, the incom ing Banze r Adm in is t ra t ion also launched an external a i d f ramewo rk ca l led the 

Nuevo Ma rc0 de Relacionamiento entre e l Gobiemo y l a Cooperacidn Intemacional, a proposal 

aimed at increasing the effectiveness o f development a i d and a l ign ing external assistance w i t h 
po l i t ica l vision. In M a y 1999 the Government and the B a n k o f f i c i a l l y launched the CDF , but the 
implementation o f i t s principles-long-term 
ho l is t ic vision, coun t ry ownership, coun t ry - led 

115 

partnership and results orientation-took 
place in the middle o f a complex situation: at the same 
time that recognized economic, social and ins t i tu t iona l advances were tak ing place, social 
tensions were becom ing even more evident. 

By 2000 B o l i v i a was e l ig ib le f o r a debt reduc t ion package under the enhanced m g h l y Indebted 
Poor Countries (H IPC 11) in i t ia t ive . B o l i v i a qua l i f ied t o beg in rece iv ing assistance under H I P C I1 
when the Boa rds o f the B a n k and the In te rna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) endorsed the country’s 
PRSP in early 2001. One o f the no tewo r thy features o f Bo l iv ia ’s PRSP i s that i t was developed 
f o l l ow i n g an extensive bo t tom -up consultation process. In 2000, the government undertook a 
b road consultation process w i t h c i v i l society and w i t h representatives o f mun ic ipa l governments 
k n ow n as the Second Na t iona l Dialogue. The PRSP considerably redefined the nature o f the 
government’s interventions b y recogn iz ing the impo r tan t ro le mun ic ipa l i t ies should p lay in 
reduc ing pove r ty . With the H I P C I1 debt re l ie f , f o r the f i r s t t ime resources were go ing t o be 
distributed 
t o mun ic ipa l i t ies in accordance w i t h pove r ty criteria. 
The PRSP was a 
comprehensive strategy organized around the f o l l ow i n g fou r strategic components: (i) expanding 
employment and income opportunities by supporting and p romo t ing p roduc t ive capabilities, (ii) 
building capabilities by guaranteeing improvements in the de l ive ry o f social services, (iii) 
increasing security and protection f o r the poo r and the most vulnerable segments o f the 
population, and (iv) p romo t ing in teg ra t ion and social participation. 

T rack ing Results 

There have been several efforts t o set and t rack targets related t o development outcomes in 
B o l i v i a . The country’s i n i t i a l efforts at i d e n t i f y i n g results and establishing performance targets 
began w i t h the H I P C I i n i t i a t i v e in 1998 and were taken up again as a central part o f the progress 
rev iew conducted during the Consultative G roup (CG) meetings later that year. This set o f 
indicators and target goals replaced those indicators established under the Na t iona l A c t i o n Plan. 
In August o f 2000, the Government no ted that 16 ou t o f the 17 core targets were met. In 
particular, s ign i f ican t advances were made in increasing the p roduc t iv i ty o f labou r in the non - 
t rad i t iona l ag r icu l tu ra l sector, p r o v i d i n g p i p e d water, mode rn iz ing pub l ic administration, and 
eradicating coca. 

Bo l iv ia ’s PRSP established the overarching goal o f reduc ing pove r ty levels f r o m 63 percent in 
2000 t o 4 1 percent by 2015. I t i s d i f f i c u l t at this ea r ly stage t o repo r t on progress in this l o n g - 
te rm goal, but the PRSP also established another set o f impact, intermediate and results 
indicators that are be ing closely mon i to red b y the Government. Since the PRSP was endorsed in 
early 2001, the Government’s Econom ic and Soc ia l P o l i c y Ana lys is Unit (UDAPE) prepared a 
series o f progress reports. 
In qua l i ta t ive terms, these reports i d e n t i f y the m a i n recognized 
achievements o f the PRSP t o be: (i) a better targeting o f resources at pove r ty reduction; (ii) the 
progressive d is t r ibu t ion o f resources so as t o bene f i t the poorest popu la t ion and the creation o f 
the Fondo So l ida r io Mun ic ipa l t o reduce the h is to r ica l shortage in the ava i lab i l i ty o f teachers and 
health staff, p r im a r i l y in poo r ru ra l mun ic ipa l i t ies ; (iii) the development o f pa r t ic ipa to ry 
mechanisms at the mun ic ipa l leve l t o imp rove dec is ion -mak ing in resource allocation; ( iv ) the 
implementation o f the Mechan ism o f Social C o n t r o l (MCS), w h i c h includes c i v i l society 
institutions and an in te r - ins t i tu t iona l government committee, designed to imp rove pa r t ic ipa to ry 
evaluation mechanisms t o fo l low -up o n the PRSP; and (v) substantial progress regarding the 
PRSP imp lemen ta t ion plan. 

116 

The imp lemen ta t ion o f the C D F in B o l i v i a strengthened the focus on r e s u l t s in the pub l ic sector 
and the donor commun i ty . By 2000, B o l i v i a was already k n ow n as one o f the tw o countries that 
had made the most ove ra l l progress among a l l C D F countries. The O E D ca r r ied ou t a m u l t i -

systems has been impressive in the last few years (a summary o f the p roduc t ion o f statistical 
in fo rma t ion i s p rov ided in Box. 1) and there has been some progress in elaborating mechanisms 
t o t rack development results. 

Box 1. Information systems 
In general, the produc t ion o f statistical in fo rma t ion i s carried out in con junc t ion w i t h the organizations that 
make up the Na t iona l System o f Statistical In forma t ion . The actual produc t ion o f basic statistical in fo rma t ion 
in B o l i v i a i s realized p r inc ipa l ly b y the Na t iona l Ins t i tu te o f Statistics (Znstituto Nac iona l de Estadistica, INE), 
the Economic Analysis P o l i c y Unit (Un idad de Andlisis de Po l i t icas Econdmicas y Sociales, UDAPE), and the 
sectoral ministries. R aw data i s obtained through the na t iona l censuses, surveys, and adm in is tra t ive registers 
which, in turn, are comp i led f r om health centers, educational units, ministries, mun ic ipa l offices, and some 
pub l ic companies. 
The Znstituto Nacional de Estadistica (INE) collects and maintains a l l data sources f o r pover ty reduc t ion 
efforts. There are tw o p r inc ipa l data sources used fo r measuring and mon i to r ing pove r ty in B o l i v i a : a na t iona l 
census ( o f wh ich the last ins ta l lmen t was in 2001) and various household surveys. The na t iona l census (Censo 
Nacional de Poblacion y V iv ienda) , carried out approximately every ten years, provides data o n non-monetary 
indicators o f we l l-be ing wh ich i s then used for b u i l d i n g pover ty maps and targeting government interventions 
using the concept o f Unme t Basic Needs (Necesidades Basicas Znsatisfechas or NBI). The IN E -UD A P E - 
Censo 2001 recently p rov ided an update o f the country’s NB I-based pover ty map (2002). 
I n add i t ion to this census, B o l i v i a ’ s INE has implemented over the years a number o f mu l t i-purpose household 
surveys. Until 1995, INE carr ied ou t the Encuesta Zntegrada de Hogares in Bo l iv ia ’s larger cities. The key 
results fo r the 1989-1995 pe r iod are available o n CD -ROM , and standardized data f i les f o r selected years have 
been prepared b y CEPA L . In 1996 and 1997, INE implemented three rounds o f the Encuesta Nac iona l de 
Empleo (June 1996, November 1996, and November 1997). These surveys had na t iona l coverage. The 
November 1997 survey i s the richest in terms o f content because i t contains detailed modules o n education and 
health. 
In M a r c h 1999, INE implemented the Encuesta Con t inua de Hogares again in B o l i v i a ’ s larger cities. The 
survey prov ided in fo rma t ion o n bo th income and, to a lesser degree, expenditures. Then, in November 1999, 
INE implemented the Encuesta Continua de Hogares-Condiciones de V ida at the na t iona l leve l . Th is survey 
benefited in part f r om the support o f the M E C O V I program. The range o f questions in this 1999 survey i s 

117 

more comprehensive than in previous surveys due to modules on health, education, occupation, income, and 
expenditures. The module on expenditures has been par t icu lar ly useful fo r future pover ty mon i tor ing . 
These surveys are no t always comparable due to changes over t ime in the questionnaires and the fact that some 
o f surveys have on ly been implemented in large urban areas only, mak ing i t d i f f icu l t to establish national 
pover ty trends in B o l i v i a in the 1990s. Some additional in fo rma t ion for ru ra l areas i s also available in tw o 
surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 b y Bo l iv ia ’s social investment fund (Fondo de Invers ion Soc ia l , F IS ) . But 
these surveys are no t f u l l y representative o f ru ra l areas so results should be treated w i t h caution. 
INE currently f ie lds the Encuesta Con t inua de Hogares-Condiciones de V ida regu lar ly and at a national 
level. I t s advantages are p r inc ipa l ly that instead o f income, expenditures are the preferred indicator o f we l l- 
being, and the use o f the survey to compute the cost o f basic food and non- food needs. 
Since October o f 1999, B o l i v i a has participated in the M E C O V I (Me joram ien to de las Encuestas y l a 

Med ic ion de las Condiciones de V ida en America La t ina y el Car ibe) program coordinated j o i n t l y b y CEPAL , 

the In te r -Ame r ican Development Bank, and the W o r l d Bank . Among i ts aims are to improve the system o f 
household surveys, imp rove the use o f surveys for pover ty targeting, and strengthen the ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
o f member countries to analyze the survey data fo r po l icy and pro jec t design. I n Bo l iv ia , M E C O V I assisted 
INE in i t s e f for ts to create an Integrated System o f Household Surveys as par t o f the strategy o f statistical 
in fo rma t ion to combat pover ty . 

Success to Date i n Achieving the M i l l e n n i um Development Goa ls 

Recently, B o l i v i a has adopted a m o d i f i e d version o f the M i l l e n n i u m Development Goals 
(MDGs), a l ign ing i t s PRSP t o a set o f MDGs that best reflects i t s situation. The adoption o f the 
MDGs b y B o l i v i a and the international commun i ty has changed the results-orientation approach 
f r om an extensive and o f ten ambiguous l i s t o f indicators t o a mo re concrete selected set o f goals 
and targets. The o r ig ina l version o f the country’s PRSP contains a b road range o f almost f i f t y 
indicators; a revised version o f the strategy iden t i f ies a selected group o f twe lve targets. In this 
way, the coun t ry has taken a first step in adopting a m o d i f i e d version o f the MDGs by a l ign ing 
i t s PRSP t o a selection o f MDGs. T h e U n i t e d Na t ions Deve lopmen t P rog ram (UNDP) has been

Progress Achieved i n In t roduc ing a Results O r ien ta t ion i n the Pub l ic Sector 

Despite the Government’s increased focus o n setting and t rack ing targets, there has been much 
l e s s progress made in a l l the supporting activities needed t o make a results-based management 
(RBM) system w o r k in B o l i v i a . F o r example, there has been l i t t l e connection between the 
setting o f targets and the preparation o f the m in is te r ia l annual operating plans, budgetary 
allocations, o r the design o f externally financed development programs. An RBM approach 
emphasizes the need t o c l a r i f y the unde r ly ing cause and effect relations between actions and 
results. However, many agencies appear t o be stuck at the conceptual l e v e l o f f i x i n g resu l ts , 
w i thou t putting i n t o place practical, operational systems to mon i to r intermediate indicators. 

120 

The findings o f a UK’s Development Strategies repo r t on RBM in B o l i v i a ’ are revealing. T h e 
report argues tha t advances t o date w i t h a comprehensive results-based management approach 
have been l im i ted , p r inc ipa l ly because o f the d i f f i c u l t y o f in t roduc ing pub l ic sector r e f o rm i n t o a 
system where p o l i t i c a l patronage remains strong. 
I t states that “[r]esults-based pub l ic 
expenditure management i s based o n a system o f performance measures, selection o f targets, 
evaluation and ve r i f ica t ion and mon i to r ing . . . . However, i t requires a m i n im a l l y e f fec t ive 
bureaucracy, especially in personnel management, budgeting and f inanc ia l controls. The 
B o l i v i a n pub l ic administration does n o t mee t these minimum requirements.. ..” 

Recently, the W o r l d B a n k has been active in he lp ing the government development operational 
systems t o t rack targets and mon i to r intermediate indicators. The progress t o date i s discussed in 
B o x 2. 

I Box 2. Attr ibut ing Outcomes to Policy Actions 

The W o r l d B a n k has been he lp ing the government develop a system dynamics approach as a way o f 
developing rather complex, graphic, structural models o f these dynamic relations in a g iven system easily and 
in tu i t ive ly . A system dynamics approach i s par t icu lar ly use fu l since a result i s rare ly due t o a single action. 
Even in simple cases, results depend o n a mu l t i tude o f p o l i c y actions-ach 
w i t h i t s o w n dynamic path-that 
affect outcomes w i t h i n that system. The approach also a l lows fo r the representation o f the dynamic aspects 
o f feedback effects and t ime lags in a system and helps avo id the d i f f i c u l t y o f keep ing mu l t ip le dynamic 
relationships in one’s head. I t also offers impor tan t benefits fo r p lann ing and fo r mon i to r ing and evaluation 
activities. 
T o date, the government and the W o r l d Bank have f in ished a mode l that analyzes the relations between health 
sector po l ic ies and under ly ing epidemiological r i s k s that together determine the prevalence o f ma lar ia in the 
country. The mode l takes in to account the feedback between infected ind iv idua ls and the rate o f transmission 
o f the disease, as w e l l as the actions undertaken and the government’s planned 2001-05 strategic sector plan, 
and also tracks the costs and f inanc ing needs contemplated b y the plan. Socioeconomic factors that affect, 
say, the responses b y d i f feren t groups to a diagnosis and treatment program can be factored in to the model. 
S im i lar ly , exogenous factors that may affect the outcome, b u t may no t be amenable to pub l ic po l icy , can be 
incorporated. 
Progress has also been made in mode l ing the re la t ion between p o l i c y actions and in fan t mo r ta l i ty and 
in fec t ious disease outcomes. F ina l ly , there i s an e f fo r t underway to analyze the relations between educational 
po l icy decisions and outcomes. 

C. Coun t r y Deve lopmen t Results and CAS Outcomes 

The previous CAS proposed a set o f core ou tcome benchmarks t o “help guide, mon i to r and 
evaluate the imp lemen ta t ion o f the CAS during the com ing f i v e years.” Tab le 2 presents the 
targets as o r ig ina l ly proposed and the actual values o f the benchmarks in 2002.

Clearly, the CAS benchmarks were n o t met. A l though the FY98-FY02 C A S stated that the 
effectiveness o f the C A S should be judged by i t s ab i l i ty t o de l ive r the desired pove r ty reduc t ion 
results, i t i s u n l i k e l y that the poo r outcomes can be attributed t o the W o r l d Bank . The lack o f 
progress in the core C A S benchmarks i s la rge ly due t o the d i f f i c u l t economic situation that 
B o l i v i a has gone through over the last f i v e years. During the la te 1990s and ea r ly 2000, B o l i v i a 
was hit by external and in te rna l shocks that l e d to lowe r g row th rates and stressed the p r iva te and 
pub l ic sectors. The last f i v e years have been years o f l o w growth, stagnation in pove r ty 
reduc t ion and increasing social con f l ic t . 
There were several external factors that tu rned unfavourable beg inn ing in 1998. The Russian 
crisis and the devaluation o f the B r a z i l i a n rea l led t o a sudden stop of.capita1 i n f l ow s and capital 
ou t f lows in emerging markets, decelerating growth, t a r t i c u l a r l y among B o l i v i a ’ s t rad ing 
partners, leading t o less demand f o r B o l i v i a n exports. 
The Argentinean crisis o f 2001, 
i n v o l v i n g curtailment o f credit and a sharp devaluation o f the A rgen t ine currency reduced 
B o l i v i a n exports t o Argentina, 
increased compe t i t ion in the domestic market f r o m cheap 
A rgen t ine imports, and d im in ished remittances f r o m B o l i v i a n workers in Argentina. W h e n the 
external environment turned unfavourable in 1998, banks, and in pa r t icu la r fo re ign banks that 
had recently acquired l o c a l banks, q u i c k l y reacted by reducing and res t ruc tu r ing the i r po r t fo l ios . 
The effects o f these external shocks were compounded by in te rna l shocks caused by the 
eradication o f coca crops, an aggressive campaign against smuggling as part o f the Customs 
Reform-which was supported by the Bank-and by adverse weather shocks. The worsening

trad ing partners. The analysis also shows a h i g h corre la t ion between B o l i v i a ’ s g row th and that o f Argentina and 
B raz i l . These resu l ts suggest there are tw o sources o f shocks that affect Bolivia-a 
d irec t shock that lowers 
grow th in B o l i v i a and an ind irec t shock that lowers g row th in trading partners that leads to lower demand fo r 
B o l i v i a n exports. The systemic drop in cap i ta l i n f l ow s to the L A C reg ion in the late 1990s cou ld exp la in the 
strong change in Bo l iv ia ’s growth.

economic s i tua t ion has been exacerbated b y an escalating t rend o f social con f l ic ts that emerged 
in early 2000 and continues today. 
The net effect o f these economic shocks and social c o n f l i c t was a drop in the rate o f g row th f r o m 
5.03 percent in 1998 t o 2.8 percent in 2002 and an increase in pove r ty rates f r o m 60 t o 64 
percent between 1999 and 2001. B y the end o f the 1990s, the f isca l situation had deteriorated 
due t o the l a g in g row th and subsequent drop in tax revenues. The d i f f icu l t ies the pub l ic sector 
faced were shared by the corporate and f inanc ia l sectors, as re f lec ted in the i r negative 
performance indicators. Tab le 3 demonstrates that the actual economic performance o f k e y 
economic ind ica to rs tu rned ou t worse than even C A S l o w case scenario projections.

In add i t ion t o the core C A S benchmarks, the 1998 C A S presented a p rog ram m a t r i x that 
contained an exhaustive l i s t o f coun t ry performance ind ica to rs and W o r l d B a n k G roup self- 
evaluation indicators that were intended t o be used t o t rack progress, n o t o n l y f o r the W o r l d 
Bank , but also f o r donors and the Government. This m a t r i x turned ou t t o be q u i c k l y supplanted 
by a reduced set o f core and complementary indicators developed j o i n t l y b y the Government and 
donors that were rev iewed during the C G meetings. 
A l though Coun t ry Performance Indicators in the C A S P rog ram M a t r i x received ve ry l i t t l e 
f o l l ow - u p because they were so soon replaced by a d i f fe ren t set, Attachment Table 1 attempts t o 
report on progress towards mee t ing the o r ig ina l targets. 
I n retrospect, the task o f compa r ing 
actual outcomes t o the targets p roved exceedingly d i f f i c u l t . M a n y targets were n o t quantified. 
Others were d i f f i c u l t t o measure. Some can o n l y be measured w i t h census data that i s reported 
every 10 years. Mo reove r , because the Government and donors chose t o track a d i f fe ren t set o f 
coun t ry performance indicators, the coun t ry performance ind ica to rs in the CAS P rog ram M a t r i x 
were n o t ac t ive ly tracked and the Bank indicators were n o t updated when the nature o f the 
lending p rog ram changed. 

123 

Based o n wha t c o u l d be reviewed, the performance in mee t ing targets was decidedly m ixed . In 
the equ i ty area, many of the targets were met. A greater emphasis o n social po l ic ies was 
f o l l ow e d by a greater allocation o f resources and an observed impac t o n social indicators. Social 
expenditure increased f r om 15.7 percent o f GDP in 1998 to 19.6 percent in 2002, and the 
e f f ic iency and qua l i ty of social services imp roved as we l l . The in t roduc t ion and imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the hea l th r e f o rm has led to an impo r tan t increase in coverage across p r i o r i t y indicators-i.e. 
births attended b y trained personnel, complete pre-natal care attendance, administration o f 
DPT/Pentavalent vaccine. 
Indeed, the impac t of the Bank ’s assistance in the health sector has 
been remarkable. In the education sector, the impac t o f the Bank’s assistance has also been 
strong. D r a w i n g upon advances made by the previous administration, the Government managed 
t o push f o rw a r d a transformation o f bo th the ins t i tu t iona l and technical-pedagogical aspects o f 
the education system. N e t p r ima ry coverage has reached 96.4 percent and the p r ima ry 
comp le t ion rate reached 72.7 percent w i t h an annual increase o f tw o percentage po in ts pe r year, 
p lac ing B o l i v i a o n track to achieve universal primary education b y 2015. 
Howeve r , o n the macro front, over the last C A S pe r iod the B a n k underestimated the l im i t e d 
ab i l i ty o f the economy t o withstand shocks. Moreover, the f isca l imbalance was re in fo rced by 
the deterioration o f the bank ing and corporate sectors, w h i c h added t o the problems created b y 
the pension system reform, putting the fiscal f ramewo rk o n a non-sustainable, exp los ive path. 
F ina l ly , the ob jec t ive o f pove r ty reduc t ion was n o t achieved, and the system o f safety ne ts 
p roved i n f l e x i b l e and unable t o protect the mos t vulnerable groups in the even ts o f unexpected 
shocks. W h i l e the B a n k carried ou t a use fu l study o n the microeconomic constraints t o growth, 
the lend ing p rog ram over the past CAS pe r iod did n o t address the bottlenecks that impede higher 
g row th . 
With regard t o ins t i tu t iona l reforms and decentralization, achievements are m ixed . There was 
progress in conso l ida t ing reforms in three k e y p u b l i c agencies: the Na t iona l Customs Service, the 
Tax Services and the Na t iona l Roads Service. Be tween 1998 and 2001, tax revenues co l lec ted 
b y the T a x Service increased f r om 7.48 percent t o 10.9 percent o f GDP and, during the same 
period, mo re than 20,000 pub l ic employees in the upper and m i d d l e levels o f government 
presented a swo rn statement of the i r personal goods. In the j u d i c i a l sector, impo r tan t laws were 
approved t o deal w i t h c r im ina l procedures and the c i v i l code. A C i v i l Service Statute was 
approved and a C i v i l Service Superintendency was created. SIGMA-an 
integrated f inanc ia l 
management system-has 
been imp lemen ted in the who le central administration and w i l l be 
soon imp lemen ted at the departmental and m u n i c i p a l levels. 
There remains, however, impo r tan t aspects o f b o t h S I G M A and the PRI that are s t i l l pending, 
inc lud ing extending the imp lemen ta t ion o f S I G M A t o Mun ic ipa l i t ies and Prefectures that w i l l 
require fu r the r evaluation t o determine their f inanc ia l , technical, and ins t i tu t iona l sustainability 
over time. 
Ins t i tu t iona l reforms succeeded in three k e y autonomous agencies (national roads, 
customs and tax services), however, the core o f the p u b l i c sector remains la rge ly un re fo rmed and 
s t i l l su f fe rs f r o m deep ins t i tu t iona l weakness. T a k i n g i n t o account ins t i tu t iona l constraints 
w i t h i n the j u d i c i a l branch, the B a n k decided t o d rop i t s support a imed at strengthening the 
j u d i c i a l system. 
Regarding decentralization, the WBG plays, th rough the C A S and i t s lending instruments, an 
impo r tan t r o l e to unify donor support t o the area of f isca l and administrative decentralization in 
B o l i v i a . There are three impo r tan t lessons that can be learned f r o m the experience t o date. First, 
w h i l e imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rog ram supported by specific operation (e.g. the PSAC - I ) has been, 

124 

in general, satisfactory, and basic ins t i tu t iona l arrangements f o r decentralization established at 
the outset o f the p rog ram are in place, continued efforts are needed in the areas o f re in fo rc ing the 
incen t ive structure and system o f administrative controls to address the core aspects o f the 
decentralization process, inc lud ing the need f o r f isca l discipline, clear l ines o f respons ib i l i ty 
among the leve ls o f p u b l i c administration, and the invo lvemen t o f c i v i l society stakeholders in 
the de l ive ry and oversight o f services at the loca l leve l . The programmatic adjustment approach 
provides a good ins t rumen t f o r con t inu ing such support. Second, the new government i s using 
the f l e x i b i l i t y o f the programmatic approach t o imp rove the ins t i tu t iona l arrangements f o r 
decentralization-including 
establishing the ComitC de Analisis de D e s c e n t r a l i z a c i h (CAD ) and 
re th ink ing the ro le o f the FPS-and p rov ide the basis f o r the soon-to-be f ina l ized Na t iona l 
Decen t ra l iza t ion Strategy. Third, the cen t ra l i ty o f decentralization w i t h i n the B o l i v i a n Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy and the challenges inherent t o operations with m u l t i p l e partners and 
government stakeholders require a high leve l o f donor and WBG coo rd ina t ion and intense 
supervision o f the government’s decentralization program. 

IFC Accomplishments since last CAS 

Despite the adverse social and economic conditions that p reva i led during the past few years, the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f IFC ’s strategy has been strong in supporting the B o l i v i a n p r iva te sector 
during one o f the mos t d i f f i c u l t periods in recent h is to ry . The 1998 C A S P S S articulated IFC’s 
m a i n areas o f focus: (i) f inanc ia l sector development; (ii) support f o r S M E s and microenterprises 
through f inanc ia l intermediaries; (iii) p r iva te infrastructure; (iv) support f o r general industry, 
inc lud ing export-oriented enterprises in manufacturing, gas, and mining; and (v) non-investment 
ac t iv i ty t o imp rove the bus iness environment. 
As o f October 31, 2003, IFC ’ s p o r t f o l i o (outstanding loans, syndicated loans and equity) stood at 
US$ lOS m i l l i o n . Three-quarters o f the p o r t f o l i o consisted o f in f ras t ruc tu re projects, inc lud ing 
transportation, power, water infrastructure, and telecommunications, w h i l e the rest consisted o f 
the f inanc ia l sector, mining, and chemicals. IFC ’s support has been strong re la t ive t o the size o f 
the economy. During FY99 -FY04 ( th rough October 2003), I F C comm i t ted t o f inanc ing f o r 12 
projects f o r US$132 m i l l i o n , inc lud ing syndications, focusing o n the IFC’s C A S p r i o r i t y areas 
and f o l l ow i n g o n the Bank ’s w o r k in the relevant sectors. 
The re la t ive ly sma l l size o f projects in the indus t r ia l sector has been a constraint f o r direct I F C 
investment. B y p r o v i d i n g s ix credit l i n e s ( inc lud ing the fou r new l ines approved in FY 0 3 ) in the 
f inanc ia l sector f o r non - lend ing t o S M E s and microenterprises, IFC has been able o n a wholesale 
basis t o reach smaller companies w h i l e supporting f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions . Support f o r p r iva te 
infrastructure has been p rov ided through projects in electricity, soybean-shipping port, ra i lway , 
telecommunications, and water and sanitation, cap i ta l iz ing o n the ea r ly gains in B a n k supported

D. Measuring Bank Performance 

Po r t fo l io Assessment 

Be tween FY98 -FY02 there has been a ra t iona l iza t ion o f the Bank ’s po r t fo l io . The number o f 
projects decreased f r o m 2 1 in F Y 9 8 t o 17 as o f October 2003. Between F Y 9 9 and FYOl, there 
was a sharp deterioration in the qua l i ty o f the po r t fo l io . As o f end -FYO l B o l i v i a had 35 percent 
o f i t s commitments at risk (compared t o 7 percent as o f end-FY99) and had 24 percent o f i t s 
projects at risk. As a result o f the increase in the riskiness o f the po r t fo l io , in F Y 0 2 B o l i v i a was 
added t o the l i s t o f PIP (Portfolio Imp rovemen t Program) countries, subject t o intensive p o r t f o l i o 
m o n i t o r i n g and supervision. Between August 200 1 and June 2002, b i -mon th ly f o l l ow - u p 
Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performance Rev iews took place in B o l i v i a . An ac t ion p lan iden t i fy ing 
c r i t ica l steps, responsible un i thec to r and target dates was prepared. I t focused o n restructuring 
some p rob lem projects, ensuring the ava i lab i l i ty o f counterpart funds, mon i to r ing bidding 
processes, t rack ing ove ra l l disbursements and ca r ry ing ou t some project-specific actions. F i v e 
quantitative benchmarks and targets related t o p o r t f o l i o mon i to r ing indicators were set f o r FY02 . 
One year later, a strong improvement in p o r t f o l i o indicators was f o l l ow e d by the remova l o f the 
coun t ry f r o m the imp rovemen t program. Bo l iv ia ’s p o r t f o l i o performance went beyond the targets 
se t under the PIP. In FY 0 2 , the percentage o f commitments at risk were less than h a l f the target 
o f 20 percent established in the action plan, w h i l e the percentage o f projects at risk dropped f r o m 
24 percent in FYOl t o 11 percent in F Y 0 2 and the p roac t iv i ty index increased f r o m 0 t o 100 
percent. Tab le 4 presents a comparative v i ew o f the p o r t f o l i o performance over the last C A S 
period. There has been a deterioration o f the p o r t f o l i o in FY03 , w i t h a sharp increase in the 
number o f risk flags f r o m 7 in F Y 0 2 t o 28 in F Y 0 3 (40 percent are related t o procurement and 
p ro jec t management).

OED evaluated 21 projects that ex i ted between FY98 and FY03. Regarding B a n k performance, 
about 81 percent o f the projects evaluated are ra ted as satisfactory, o n l y one o f the projects has a

B o l i v i a projects were o n l y part o f the sample in 2000 f o r Qua l i ty at Entry Assessment (QEA), 
b o t h projects were ra ted satisfactory at entry. Results are encouraging, but i t i s w o r t h men t ion

D e l i v e r y 

Approvals ove r the entire FY99-FY02 pe r iod equalled US$373 m i l l i o n , w h i c h l ies between the 
base case o f US$325 m i l l i o n and the high case o f US$450 o f the 1998 CAS . I t i s wo r th n o t i n g 
that the nature o f the projects changed somewhat over the course o f the C A S pe r iod f r om what 
had been p lanned at the beg inn ing o f the pe r iod . Tab le 7 compares actual t o p lanned projects, i t 
can be c lea r ly seen that a number o f projects were dropped o r delayed. In fact, o n l y f i v e o f the 18 
proposed projects were actually carried out, re f lec t ing the adaptation o f the Bank ’s p rog ram o f 
support t o the economic, social and p o l i t i c a l circumstances faced by the country. F o r instance, 
the series o f mun ic ipa l development projects were replaced by a series o f PSACs in 
decentralization in order t o tackle issues w i t h i n the who le system o f decentralization instead o f 
p rov id ing support t o stand-alone m u n i c i p a l projects. S im i la r ly , a Jud ic ia l R e f o rm project was 
dropped in face o f p o l i t i c a l constraints and a Secondary and H ighe r Educa t ion R e f o rm project 
was dropped due t o d i f f icu l t ies in ca r ry ing out t w o ma jo r re fo rms in the education sector -the 
Education R e f o rm P rog ram was be ing imp lemen ted in primary. The in t roduc t ion o f a Social 
Safety N e t S A C in FY03 responded t o the urgent need t o p rov ide immed ia te response t o the 
current social and economic crisis in B o l i v i a . I t helped the Government t o close a f inanc ing gap 
in 2003 w h i l e guaranteeing the p rov is ion o f basic social services during the pe r iod o f f isca l 
adjustment. 
The approval o f o n l y one p ro jec t f o r US$5 m i l l i o n in f isca l year 2000 stands out. This occurred 
as the result o f an exp l ic i t decision b y the B a n k n o t t o go fo rwa rd w i t h add i t iona l projects until 
the Government proceeded w i t h the ins t i tu t iona l iza t ion o f the N a t i o n a l Road Service. This 
decision reflects the seriousness that B a n k attached t o ins t i tu t iona l development w i t h the 
launching o f the CDF . Other changes included: (i) the replacement o f a proposed series o f 
investment projects in mun ic ipa l development f o r a fa r - rang ing Programmatic Structural 
Adjustment C red i t in decentralization; (ii) d ropp ing a secondary and h ighe r education stand- 
alone project in favou r o f m o d i f y i n g the ex is t ing Educa t ion R e f o rm p ro jec t t o incorporate a

w i t h i n the universities, this approach was adopted t o p romo te a low -key , home -g rown demand 
for change); (iii) d ropp ing a Jud ic ia l R e f o rm project and tw o other ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm projects,

Appropriateness of Instruments and F iduc ia ry Issues 

The use o f APLs was appropriate g iven the strong emphasis on long - te rm ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm . 
L I L s are be ing used e f fec t ive ly t o t e s t new approaches (Indigenous People Development) and t o 
address specific issues in sectors where the B a n k has limited interventions (Hydrocarbons). 
S ign i f ican t attention was g iven t o f iduc ia ry issues . The resu l ts o f the C F A A and the CPAR were 
inc luded as benchmarks o f an adjustment operation (PSAC I). 

E. Consultation 

Ove r the last C A S pe r iod the Bank ’s p rog ram o f support was entirely aligned w i t h the 
government’s development plan, first t o the Na t iona l A c t i o n P lan and later t o the country’s 
PRSP. B o t h o f them resulted f r o m b road consultation processes, the First and Second Na t iona l 
Dialogues, respectively. This section w i l l discuss the government’s efforts t o move towards mo re 
open and pa r t ic ipa to ry p o l i c y planning. 

. 

In 1997, the Government convened Na t iona l Dialogues that b rough t together d i f fe ren t sectors o f 
society t o discuss Government plans and pub l ic p o l i c y objectives. Subsequent and successive 
rounds o f this Na t iona l D ia logue were envisioned; each expected t o build upon the results o f the 
p rev ious rounds. 
In October o f 1997, the Government convened the F i rs t Na t iona l D ia logue that b rough t together 
representatives f r om the business commun i ty , the church, c i v i l society organizations, labo r 
groups, NGOs, and universities, w i t h the Government and oppos i t ion parties also participating. 
Desp i te some shortcomings, the dialogue produced various pos i t ive outcomes and resulted in 
agreements t o support a p rog ram t o reduce pove r ty and boost economic g row th . This l e d t o the 
Na t iona l A c t i o n P lan men t ioned in previous sections. Against this backdrop, the Government 
p r io r i t ized social spending and began imp lemen t ing programs a imed at a l lev ia t ing pove r ty and 
im p r o v i n g the l i v i n g cond i t ions o f the population. A l though the Government made substantial 
e f fo r ts t o implement this strategy, l i t t l e fo l low -up was done be fo re the inaugu ra t ion o f the second 
Na t iona l D ia logue in 2000. A mu l t i -d isc ip l ina ry group was also convened to w o r k on a proposal 
t o fight poverty. I n September o f 1998, the group pub l ished a document i d e n t i f y i n g actions t o 
fight the roo t causes o f pove r ty and underdevelopment. The document no ted that the m a i n 
assurance that these actions w o u l d be imp lemen ted was the capacity o f B o l i v i a n society t o take 
respons ib i l i ty f o r ca r ry ing them ou t (an idea that became a p r inc ipa l ob jec t ive o f the second 
Na t iona l D ia logue in 2000). 
The Second Na t iona l D ia logue was launched in April o f 2000 t o p romo te a pa r t ic ipa to ry 
approach in the preparation o f B o l i v i a ’ s PRSP. In the months preceding the dialogue, various 
c i v i l society groups m o b i l i z e d o n the i r ow n t o prepare the i r o w n dialogues. This inc luded the 
catholic church-sponsored jubilee 2000 f o r um o f NGO s and inc luded groups representing sma l l 
producers, indigenous people and miners. The Second Na t iona l D ia logue was designed as a 
bo t tom -up process w i t h discussions tak ing place f i r s t at the mun ic ipa l level, and then m o v i n g t o 
the reg iona l and national  level^.^ F o u r topics were discussed at the mun ic ipa l roundtables: 
determinants o f poverty, mechanisms f o r the a l loca t ion o f H I P C debt r e l i e f resources, citizens’

pa r t ic ipa t ion in mon i to r ing the use o f H I P C resources, and ca r ry ing ou t a f o l l ow - u p o f the 
national dialogue. The n ine departmental roundtables inc luded delegates f r om each o f the 
mun ic ipa l roundtables, as w e l l as representatives f r om the government, c i v i l society and the 
Jubilee 2000 f o r u m o f NGOs . But h igh - leve l government pa r t ic ipa t ion in these departmental 
roundtables was l im i ted , w i t h government o f f ic ia ls present at o n l y three o f the n ine roundtables. 
The meetings focused on p r i o r i t y actions at the reg iona l l e v e l in the fight against pove r ty , as w e l l 
as citizens’ pa r t ic ipa t ion in the mon i to r ing o f resources f o r pub l ic investment, the content and 
ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk o f pub l ic policies, and conduc t ing a fo l low -up o f the Na t iona l Dialogue. 
In August o f 2000, delegates f r o m the mun ic ipa l and departmental roundtables attended the 
national dialogue w i t h the attendance o f government m i n i s t e r s and vice-ministers as w e l l as 
representatives o f c i v i l society. However, representation o f p o l i t i c a l pa r t ies and the legislature 
was ve ry l ow . S i x sectoral topics were discussed: support t o production, education, health, basic 
sanitation and housing, land, and the environment. Some structural issues were also discussed 
inc lud ing tax po l icy , labo r re fo rm , trade po l icy , and the regu la to ry environment f o r businesses. 
Agreements were reached o n several topics, inc lud ing : (i) the determination o f p r i o r i t y p o l i c y 
areas (such as p roduc t ive infrastructure and support f o r production, education, health, and l a n d 
tenure); (ii) the de f in i t ion o f a mechanism f o r the d is t r ibu t ion o f HIPC resources; and (iii) the 
need t o establish social oversight mechanisms w h i c h w o u l d g ive c i v i l society a r o l e in 
mon i to r ing the u t i l i z a t i o n o f H I P C resources. 
The Government drafted the PRSP based o n the resu l ts o f the Second Na t iona l D ia logue . The 
document was shared w i t h the general pub l ic , f o l l ow e d by pub l ic discussions o f the draft. As a 
result, the document was rev ised in several areas t o inc lude a mo re extensive analysis o f 
indigenous, gender, and environmental issues. Plans were then made f o r an extensive f o l l ow - u p 
t o the PRSP th rough ex is t ing mechanisms o f social oversight at the mun ic ipa l level, and through 
n ew l y created agencies o f social oversight at the departmental and na t iona l levels. This entire 
rev iew process was fo rma l ized in the new Na t iona l D ia logue L a w (Ley de D i a l o g 0 Nacional). 

But despite these e f fo r ts t o bring the pa r t ic ipa to ry process closer t o people b y decen t ra l iz ing it, 
NGOs and c i v i l society groups raised various concerns ove r whether: (i) some consultations 
were unduly in f luenced by l o c a l decision-makers; (ii) vulnerable groups were under-represented 
(spec i f ica l ly women and indigenous people); (iii) the h i g h l y structured me thodo logy used fa i led 
t o promote rea l pa r t ic ipa t ion ; and ( iv ) the agenda o f the discussions was n o t su f f ic ien t ly f lex ib le . 
Nevertheless, mos t observers agreed that the Government made a good f a i t h e f fo r t at u t i l i z i n g a 
pa r t ic ipa to ry approach in deve lop ing i t s strategy and l a i d the g roundwo rk f o r an on -go ing 
participatory process f o r m o n i t o r i n g i t s strategy. 

F. Coordination 

With regards t o donor coo rd ina t ion and partnership, there have been impo r tan t advances over the 
last years. The Consu l ta t ive G roup meetings, the in t roduc t ion o f the government’s Nuevo M a r c 0 

de Relacionamiento entre el G o b i em o y la Coope rac i6n Zntemacional, the CDF , and specific- 

sector practices have a l l imp roved donor coordination. Ove r the past C A S pe r iod the re have been 
impo r tan t efforts a imed at increasing coo rd ina t ion among donors. An e f fec t ive in -coun t ry f o r um 
f o r partner coo rd ina t ion was tempo ra r i ly in place, and dono r assistance programs were a l igned 
w i t h the country Na t iona l A c t i o n Plan. The system o f dono r coo rd ina t ion func t ioned in such a 
way that one a i d agency had t o be elected t o represent the donor commun i ty and t o w o r k w i t h a 

131 

representative o f the Government in each one o f the fou r pillars. Government pa r t ic ipa t ion in 
donor-government Consultative G roup meetings increased, and steps have been taken in m o v i n g 
away f r o m t rad i t iona l donor-driven and freestanding projects towa rd broader sector w ide 
approaches that support national goals. 

The in t roduc t ion o f the C D F a l lowed the B a n k t o p l a y an impo r tan t ro le in the donor 
coordination e f fo r t . In supporting the imp lemen ta t ion o f coun t ry programs, the B a n k wo rked 
closely w i t h other donors. The extensive use o f co - f inanc ing and technical assistance t r u s t funds 
has s t rong ly supported the CAS implementation. In F Y 0 3 TF disbursements o f $20.5 m i l l i o n 
placed B o l i v i a as the biggest coun t ry user o f t r u s t funds in the Region. S im i la r ly , there have been 
several good practices in co-financing and j o i n t coo rd ina t ion o f supervision. F o r instance, the 
Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm Program was j o i n t l y prepared between the Government and a group o f 
donors, w h i l e there were j o i n t supervision missions o f the Educa t ion R e f o rm Project. But despite 
these ma jo r advances, the assistance o f the donor commun i ty i s s t i l l disperse and fragmented, 
and e f fo r ts at ra t iona l iz ing overlapping investments and ha rmon iz ing operational practices are 
s t i l l pending. 

G. O v e r a l l Assessment o f the Pe r fo rmance o f the CAS 

B a n k management rates the ove ra l l performance o f the assistance p rog ram as satisfactory over 
the last C A S period. The B a n k did pa r t icu la r ly w e l l in the social sectors. I t in t roduced a Hea l th 
R e f o rm P rog ram that pioneered a successful results orientation and advanced w e l l in the t w o 
Educa t ion Projects, w i t h close coo rd ina t ion w i t h the other donors. A separate component 
dealing w i t h needed reforms in the Higher Educa t ion Sector was introduced, w i t h n o add i t iona l 
preparation budget, and the B a n k was ins t rumen ta l in conv inc ing other donors t o p rov ide 
additional f inanc ing t o basic education t o replace the funds directed t o H i g h e r Educa t ion Re fo rm . 

Ove r the C A S period, the B a n k also advanced reasonably w e l l in Ins t i tu t iona l Re fo rm . The 
Bank’s decision t o h o l d up a l l new lending until there was serious r e f o rm in the Na t iona l Roads 
Service (wh ich resulted in one year when o n l y $5 m i l l i o n in new projects was approved) 
p rov ided a ve ry clear signal o f h ow seriously the B a n k took the issue o f ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm . 
La rge ly as a resu l t o f this action, the Na t iona l Roads Service was re fo rmed and, though i t i s 
subject t o attempts t o introduce p o l i t i c a l interference, remains today ve ry m u c h better than i t has 
been in the past. Other advances in customs and tax administration, supported by the W o r l d 
B a n k Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm Project, are also no tewo r thy . F ina l ly , in the area o f ins t i tu t iona l 
r e f o rm and governance the B a n k made e f fec t ive use o f i t s An t i - f raud and An t i -co r rup t ion unit t o 
identify cases o f co r rup t ion that resulted in the conv ic t ion and incarceration o f those invo lved . 
L e s s success was apparent in the ins t i tu t iona l reforms dealing w i t h the M i n i s t r i e s and many o f 
the gains did n o t survive the t rans i t ion o f administration in 2002. 

The B a n k also made a strong e f fo r t t o f o l l ow th rough o n the p r inc ip les o f the CDF . I t organized 
the Coun t ry O f f i c e around three o f the government’s fou r pillars and decentralized s ta f f t o the 
f ie ld . Progress was made in coun t ry procurement procedures, cu lm ina t ing in a new procurement 
decree that w i l l make i t easier f o r donors t o harmonize around the imp roved coun t ry procedures. 
The B a n k was also proactive when the p o r t f o l i o deteriorated and successfully oversaw a 
Performance Imp rovemen t P lan that turned around the qua l i ty o f the p o r t f o l i o w i t h i n a re la t ive ly 
short time. 

132 

The B a n k was re la t ive ly l e s s successful in the area o f p r iva te sector development. The B a n k did 
carry ou t a u s e f u l study o n M ic roeconom ic Constraints t o G row th and the resu l ts o f that study 
were p i c k e d up by the government’s P roduc t iv i ty and Competitiveness Unit that was created 
w i t h i n the M i n i s t r y o f Econom ic Development.

Annex H 

In pa ra l le l w i t h the preparation o f this CAS, I D A i s supporting the n ew Government in i t s

short-term f inanc ing needs w h i l e also assisting w i t h small, focused, and v is ib le social sector 
investments. 

This emergency package comprises o f the f o l l ow i n g instruments: i) a $14 m i l l i o n 
Emergency Econom ic Recove ry Project, discussed at the B o a r d in December 2003, designed t o 
p rov ide q u i c k disbursing f inanc ing against a pos i t ive l i s t o f goods in order t o assist the 
Government o f B o l i v i a ; ii) the advance release o f the pend ing second tranche o f $10 m i l l i o n o f 
the ex is t ing Social Safety N e t SAC , conceived as a mechanism t o protect p r i o r i t y social 
expenditures after the February crisis, and sen t t o the B o a r d f o r N o Ob jec t ion in December 2003; 
iii) the acceleration o f an ex is t ing operation in the po r t fo l io , the B o l i v i a Ins t i tu t iona l R e f o rm 
project, w i t h $20 m i l l i o n envisaged t o be directed towards funding o f wages and salaries o f c i v i l 
servant h i r e d th rough compe t i t ive and transparent mechanisms in p i l o t agencies; and i v ) 
reassigning funds f r o m ongo ing I D A operations ($5.6 m i l l i o n be fo re M a r c h 2004) t o support
