EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. U k r a i n e i s a l ow e r m i d d l e income country, with a Gross Domes t ic P roduc t (GDP) pe r 
capita o f US$1940 in 2006. I t i s t h e second largest coun t ry o f the fo rme r Sov ie t U n i o n 
w i th a popu la t ion o f 46 m i l l i o n . 

ii. Since 2000, U k r a i n e has en joyed a s t rong economic recovery, with g r ow t h at around 
7.5 percent pe r year o n average. Structural change has started but rema ins incomplete. 
U k r a i n e continues t o l a g b e h i n d the European U n i o n (EU) accession in terms o f 
economic re fo rm . An impo r tan t benchma rk m a y b e reached soon with the W o r l d Trade 
O rgan iza t ion (WTO ) accession. 

iii. R a p i d economic g r ow t h has fac i l i ta ted a sharp decline in pove r ty in recent years. 
Pove r ty has fa l len sha rp ly f r o m 3 1 percent in 2001 t o 8 percent in 2005. U k r a i n e has 
en joyed one o f the fastest rates o f pove r ty reduc t ion in the Eu rope and Cen t ra l A s i a 
R e g i o n (ECA ) since the onset o f economic recove ry in 2000. Howeve r , in s p i t e o f this 
achievement, the pub l ic ’s satisfaction with the i r ma te r ia l we l l -be ing rema ins l o w . 

iv. Uk ra ine ’s mac roeconom ic f ramewo rk o n the who le remains adequate, but the 
authorities w i l l need t o b e vigilant in the face o f po ten t ia l external shocks o r p o l i t i c a l 
spending pressures. Unde r the Bank ’s base-case med ium - te rm mac roeconom ic forecast, 
g r ow t h i s ma in ta ined at around 5-6 percent pe r annum, w i th moderate i n f l a t i o n and 
external as we l l as f isca l imbalances. Ex te rna l shocks w o u l d requ i re p o l i c y adjustment t o 
safeguard Uk ra ine ’s imp rovemen ts in external creditworthiness. 

v. Desp i te frequent government changes and s ign i f ican t p o l i t i c a l v o l a t i l i t y , the bas ic 
v i s i o n o f economic development f o r the coun t ry i s b r o a d l y shared be tween a l l m a i n 
p o l i t i c a l forces. T h e development v i s i o n inc ludes a comm i tmen t t o closer in teg ra t ion 
with Eu rope and with the w o r l d economy at large. 

vi. U k r a i n e i s r e c e i v i n g increased a t ten t ion f r o m in te rna t iona l partners, in pa r t icu la r f r o m 
Europe. The EU has started nego t ia t ing a deep F ree Trade Ag reemen t w i th Uk ra ine , and 
co l lec t ive ly the Eu ropean ins t i tu t ions are n o w by fa r the largest p rov ide r o f f inanc ia l 
assistance. 

vii.This Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds o n an analysis o f Uk ra ine ’s k e y 
development challenges. T o sustain g r ow t h i n t o the future, spec i f ica l ly , U k r a i n e w i l l 
need t o address three k e y challenges: (i) the imp rovemen t in competitiveness, (ii) the 
r e f o rm o f p u b l i c f inance and the p u b l i c sector t o imp rove service d e l i v e r y and make 
g r ow t h soc ia l ly inc lus ive , and (iii) t a c k l i n g weaknesses in governance. 

v i i i . 
In response t o these challenges, the CPS proposes a tw o - p i l l a r f ramewo rk o f 
support. The f i r s t p i l l a r w i l l a i m t o im p r o v e Uk ra ine ’s competitiveness th rough 
investments in p u b l i c sector in f ras t ruc tu re (in pa r t icu la r transport and energy efficiency), 
adv iso ry services and advocacy w o r k t o im p r o v e the business climate, 
techn ica l 

assistance and access t o c red i t l ines t o strengthen the f inanc ia l sector, and g loba l 
know ledge sha r ing t o p romo te innova t ion and techno logy adoption, as we l l as t o ensure 
that U k r a i n e bene f i ts f r o m the f ramewo rk f o r in te rna t iona l ca rbon t rad ing and makes a 
con t r ibu t ion t o em iss ion reductions. The second p i l l a r w i l l seek t o im p r o v e p u b l i c 
services by ta rge t ing greater e f f ic iency in spending, and u s i n g imp rovemen ts in p u b l i c 
sector f inanc ia l management as an en t ry p o i n t i n t o p u b l i c sector re fo rms m o r e generally. 

i x . Governance and An t i -Co r rup t ion efforts w i l l cu t across b o t h p i l la rs o f the CPS. A 
k e y p r o b l em f o r U k r a i n e i s the l a c k o f t r u s t in p u b l i c sector ins t i tu t ions , and the resu l t ing 
l o w expectations trap: the p u b l i c expects l i t t l e f r o m the state, but i s in turn n o t willing t o 
make m u c h o f an e f f o r t t o advocate f o r imp rovemen ts either. T h e Bank ’s approach w i l l 
concentrate o n building demand f o r better governance, whilst con t inu ing t o seek 
oppo r tun i t ies t o strengthen p u b l i c sector ins t i tu t ions where su f f ic ien t c l ien t owne rsh ip 
and p o l i c y consensus exists. 

x. T h e In te rna t iona l F inance Corporation’s (IFC) ac t iv i t ies w i l l b e a k e y element o f the 
B a n k G roup ’s strategy. The I F C w i l l support the achievement o f target outcomes in the 
f i r s t p i l l a r th rough investments t o support mode rn iza t ion o f the p r iva te sector, and 
th rough selected investments in m u n i c i p a l and p u b l i c in f ras t ruc tu re . T h e I F C w i l l also 
l o o k f o r oppo r tun i t ies t o he lp m o b i l i z e p r iva te funding f o r the mode rn iza t ion o f p u b l i c 
services. T h e I FC ’ s expanded adv iso ry services w i l l b e a k e y component o f the B a n k 
Group’s non - lend ing in te rven t ions . 

x i . Three p r inc ip les unde r l ie the operational approach in th is CPS: (i) selectivity, (ii) 
f l e x i b i l i t y and (iii) partnerships. These p r inc ip les are d i r e c t l y de r ived f r o m the lessons o f 
experience in the p rev ious CAS . The Bank w i l l adopt a p rog ramma t ic approach, 
choos ing a selected numbe r o f areas f o r support, with the range o f instruments adapted t o 
the degree o f c l ien t ownership, development u rgency and the Bank’s o w n comparative 
advantage in r e l a t i o n t o other donors. A selection o f p rog rams across the t w o m a i n 
p i l la rs has been i d e n t i f i e d f o r the f i r s t t w o years o f the CPS. B e y o n d this, the CPS retains 
the f l e x i b i l i t y t o adjust b o t h the selection o f p rog ram and the range o f instruments t o 
chang ing c l ien t demand, development needs and e v o l v i n g development partnerships. 

x i i . The CPS lays pa r t icu la r emphasis o n non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies . Recogn iz ing that in 
several c r i t i c a l r e f o rm areas, there i s n o t yet a na t iona l consensus around r e f o rm p r io r i t ies 
o r a we l l -de f ined r e f o rm roadmap, the Bank w i l l inves t in advoca t ing f o r and building 
capacity t o imp lemen t p o l i c y changes th rough non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies and adv iso ry 
services. T o m a k e r o o m f o r this enhanced non - lend ing focus, the B a n k w i l l target 
imp rovemen ts in the pe r fo rmance o f the inves tmen t l e n d i n g po r t fo l io , a im i n g at fewer, 
larger and m o r e e f fec t ive interventions. 

... 

x m . 
T h e CPS proposes a l e n d i n g range o f US$2 -6 b i l l i o n ove r fou r years, with annual 
l e n d i n g leve ls modu la ted by a series o f pe r fo rmance benchmarks. Spec i f ica l ly , the B a n k 
w i l l m o n i t o r the maintenance o f an appropriate mac roeconom ic f ramewo rk , ove ra l l

D P L in the to ta l a l loca t ion w o u l d increase f r o m ze ro at the b o t t om o f the l e n d i n g range 
towa rds 40 percent in the m i d d l e o f the range and po ten t ia l ly h ighe r at the t o p o f the 
range. 

x i v . 
T h e B a n k G roup i s s t rong ly comm i t ted t o ha rmon iz ing i t s assistance w i th coun t ry 
systems and coo rd ina t ing i t s ac t iv i t ies with other development partners. A l t h o u g h 
co l lec t ive ly the dono r c omm u n i t y contributes o n l y m a r g i n a l l y t o Uk ra ine ’s o w n 
investments, the transactions costs f o r U k r a i n e o f dea l ing with external donors rema in 
high. T h e CPS proposes t o address th is issue by con t inu ing t o w o r k towards the greater 
use o f coun t ry systems, where appropriate, and by advoca t ing f o r p o l i c y change and 
building capacity, whe re coun t ry systems f a l l short o f acceptable standards (e.g., in 
p u b l i c procurement). Ove r time, the B a n k a ims at channe l ing an inc reas ing share o f i t s 
resources th rough the U k r a i n i a n budget, p o t e n t i a l l y against agreed pe r fo rmance targets, 
and together with other donors (e.g. th rough Sector W i d e Approaches - SWAPS). 

x v . T h e CPS i s t i e d i n t o a results f ramewo rk w h i c h w i l l serve as the m a i n t o o l f o r j o i n t 
accoun tab i l i ty during imp lemen ta t ion . A n n u a l C o u n t r y P o r t f o l i o Performance Rev iews 
(CPPRs) are p lanned at w h i c h an annual resu l ts repo r t w i l l be j o i n t l y rev iewed and

T h e B a n k w o u l d appreciate guidance from the Execu t ive D i rec to rs o n the 
f o l l o w i n g questions: 
A r e Uk ra ine ’s development challenges app rop r ia te ly i d e n t i f i e d in the CPS and 
does the tw o - p i l l a r structure o f support p r o v i d e an adequate response? 
A r e the p r inc ip les o f the CPS o f selectivity, f l e x i b i l i t y and pa r tne rsh ip and the

I s the l e n d i n g range acceptable and are the benchmarks m o d u l a t i n g be tween

was i n i t i a t e d by a sustained r e f o rm e f fo r t that began during the government o f P r im e 
M i n i s t e r Yushchenko, n o w Uk ra ine 's President, and con t inued unde r subsequent 
governments. Mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty was established, k e y indus t r ies we re p r iva t ized 
and the process o f leg is la t ive and ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm was begun. Econom ic recove ry has

become m o r e important, w h i l e agriculture has dec l ined as a share o f GDP and 
employment. T h e i n d u s t r i a l sector remains la rge and dom ina ted by capital-intensive 
branches such as iron and steel and indus t r ia l chemicals. Howeve r , catalyzed by the 
steep r i s e in the p r i c e o f impo r ted energy

although i t has caught up w i t h the ECA average (Figure 2). Since 2000, steady bu t 
gradual re fo rm progress has been made, but frequent government changes, and the lack 
o f a strong external anchor have been important constraints. An important benchmark 
may b e reached in 2007 with W T O accession.

11. RECENT ECONOMIC D E V E L O P M E N T S AND RISKS 

A. RECENT ECONOMIC GROWTH - DRIVERS AND PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY 
U k r a i n e has consistently exceeded expectations o f economic g row th over the 

27. 

p e r iod 2000-2007. 

G r o w t h averaged 7.5 percent, and p e r capita incomes in US$ , 
acco rd ing t o the A t las method, increased f r o m US $ 7 0 0 in 2000 t o US$1940 in 2006. 

28. T w o factors con t r ibu ted to this phase o f economic “recovery”. First, the f inanc ia l 

s tab i l iza t ion and in t roduc t ion o f econom ic re fo rms in 2000 e f fec t ive ly hardened budge t 
constraints, bo ls te red con f idence in the Government’s mac roeconom ic management and 
in the country’s f l e d g l i n g f inanc ia l sector, and created the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l basis f o r 
market-based exchange. 

29. Second, the r e a l exchange r a t e deprec iat ion , fo l low ing the 1998 f inanc ia l crisis in 
Russ ia a n d the ava i lab i l i ty o f amp le spare capac ity in U k r a i n i a n industry, created 
conditions whe re the re tu rns o n investment a n d en t rep reneu r ia l in i t ia t ive we re 

unusua l ly high. B o t h factors together sh i f ted the incen t ive structure towa rds f o rm a l 
economic re la t ions and away f r o m the rent-seeking p redom inan t in the 1990s. T h e resu l t 
was the emergence o f Uk ra ine ’s pa r t icu la r b r a n d o f cap i ta l ism built o n s t rong domestic 
f inanc ia l indus t r ia l groups, w h i c h o r ig ina ted thanks t o close and o f t e n non-transparent

econom ic recove ry and g row th . 

30. Uk ra ine ’s t rans i t ion p a t h to da te has t w o weaknesses: F i rs t , the sources o f 

recove ry and expo r t revenues are highly concentrated in h e a v y indus t ry , in pa r t icu la r 
ferrous me ta l lu rgy . Uk ra ine ’s econom ic pe r fo rmance i s thus vu lne rab le t o a shift in 
terms o f trade against the me ta ls sector in pa r t icu la r . Uk ra ine ’s high degree o f energy 
i n e f f i c i e n c y i s also a m a i n source o f vu lne rab i l i ty . U n l i k e other Eas te rn European 
countries, Uk ra ine ’s t rad ing patterns we re s t i l l h e a v i l y o r ien ted towa rds Russia and 
commodity-based, whereas Uk ra ine ’s peers are inc reas ing ly deve lop ing in t ra - indus t ry

short- t o med ium - te rm . A m o n g the mos t impo r tan t developments in th is regard since 
2004 are: 
T h e s ign i f ican t i n f l o w o f Fo re ign D i r e c t Inves tmen t (FDI) in 2005 and 2006, 
buoyed by the re -p r iva t iza t ion o f the coun t ry ’s largest steel m i l l (Kh ryvo r izhs ta l ) 
t o a strategic inves to r (M i t t a l Steel) and the s e l l - o f f o f strategic stakes in some o f 
the country’s m a j o r banks by the f inanc ia l indus t r ia l groups (F igu re 6a). 
western business circles, the “Orange Revo lu t ion ” put U k r a i n e o n the map and 
inves tmen t interest i s significant, i n c l u d i n g in indus t r ies such as re ta i l ing , f o o d 
processing, light indus t ry , car manu fac tu r ing and supplies. 
The t rans fo rma t ion o f Uk ra ine ’s banking sector and signs o f imp rovemen t in 
corporate governance practices in the la rge domes t ic f inanc ia l indus t r ia l groups 
has p r o v i d e d access t o finance t o a la rge p r o p o r t i o n o f U k r a i n i a n businesses and

gas im p o r t p r ices f r o m US$62 / tcm in 2005 t o US $ l 3O / t cm today. 
There i s also m ic ro -econom ic evidence tha t Uk ra ine , during the past 6 years, has 
undergone a s ign i f ican t degree o f restructuring, d r i v e n in pa r t icu la r by the en t ry 
o f n ew f i rms , and that this has con t r ibu ted t o r a p i d p r o d u c t i v i t y g r ow t h as i t did a 
decade earlier in Eastern Europe’. M o r e w o r k i s needed t o understand the 
imp l ica t ions o f these f ind ings and the greater compe t i t ion among la rge business 
groups f o r Uk ra ine ’s “insider economy” and the extent t o w h i c h they are 
re f lec t ive o f a greater degree o f dynam ism and res t ruc tu r ing than h a d been 
suggested by p rev ious analyses.

percent o f GD P surplus in 2004 t o a 1.5 percent o f GDP d e f i c i t in 2006. Such a mass ive

the pa r t ia l pass th rough o f higher gas im p o r t p r ices t o consumers and h ighe r f o o d p r ices 
f o l l o w i n g a p o o r 2007 harvest) and r a p i d mone ta ry g r ow t h have l i f t e d i n f l a t i o n t o 14.4 
percent year-on-year in September 2007. E v e n exc lud ing energy p r i c e effects, the 
Consumer P r ice I n d e x (CPI) has increased s ign i f ican t ly ove r the past year. 

28. Domest ic demand rema ins supported by h igh wage settlements, p a r t i a l l y fue l led 

b y the public sector. P r iva te sector wage settlements r em a i n high w i th annual increases 
close t o 27 percent in J u l y 2007, and recent budge t amendments w i l l push the minimum 
wage up by 2 0 percent in 2007. These high settlements m a y re f lec t g r ow i n g i n f l a t i o n a r y 
expectations. Howeve r , rea l wage g r ow t h has s lowed considerably, pa r t icu la r ly i f 
measured against p roduce r prices, and w i th fu r the r 
increases 
in utility prices, 
consump t ion g r ow t h i s l i k e l y t o fu r the r abate. 

29. T h e w iden ing cu r ren t account de f ic i t i s easily f inanced by p r i v a t e cap i ta l 
inflows. 

In 2006, U k r a i n e attracted a to ta l o f US $ 1 4 b i l l i o n in ne t debt in f lows , in 
add i t ion t o US$5.2 b i l l i o n in FDI, together amoun t ing t o 18 percent o f GDP . Some o f 
this m o n e y i s flight cap i ta l re tu rn ing f r o m abroad and thus re f lec ts the fac t that U k r a i n e i s 
n o w using some o f the savings i t accumulated in earlier years. Indeed, g i v e n Uk ra ine ’s 
inves tmen t needs in o rde r t o achieve income convergence, an excess o f inves tmen t over 
domestic savings and the corresponding i n f l o w o f fo re ign cap i ta l i s warranted. G i v e n 
current conditions, the In te rna t iona l M o n e t a r y Fund (IMF) estimates tha t U k r a i n e c o u l d 
sustain a current account d e f i c i t in the range o f 4-6 percent o f GDP . Uk ra ine ’s fixed 
inves tmen t t o GD P ra t io i s estimated at 2 4 percent f o r 2006, w h i c h i s s t i l l too l o w t o 
a l l ow incomes t o converge. 

30. F isca l po l icy has been res t ra ined in aggregate but the compos it ion o f spending 
rema ins b iased towa rds consumpt ion a n d transfers. F isca l de f ic i ts have dec l ined 

f r o m 4.4 percent o f GD P in 2004 t o 1.3 percent o f GD P in 2006, s tay ing w e l l b e l ow 
budge t p ro jec t ions . W h i l e p u b l i c consump t ion expenditures as a share o f GDP have 
increased s ign i f ican t ly since 2004, as wage and pens ion payments we re hiked, tax 
revenue has been equa l ly buoyant, boosted by im p r o v e d collections, the tightening o f tax 
loopho les and s t rong impo r t - re la ted Va lue -Added T a x (VAT) performance. Howeve r , by

an exchange ra te co r rec t ion might b e required, together with a s ign i f ican t t igh ten ing o f

fo rce res t ruc tu r ing in the b a n k i n g sector and p reven t bank failures t o translate i n t o quasi- 
f isca l l iab i l i t ies . Uk ra ine ’s current reserves o f re la t ive ly “easy g row th ” w o u l d become 
m o r e q u i c k l y exhausted. 

34. Developments du r ing the summer o f 2007 have highlighted these risks. 

T r igge red by concerns ove r the fa l l -ou t f r o m the sub -p r ime mo r tgage ma rke t in the

In Uk ra ine , too, equ i ty markets have dec l ined somewhat after reco rd gains, and b o n d 
spreads have widened, but reserve accumu la t ion by the N a t i o n a l B a n k o f U k r a i n e (NBU)

there has been a gradual re -p r ic ing o f U k r a i n i a n r i s k in in te rna t iona l markets, w h i c h

in f luence o f big domestic business in the maintenance o f mac roeconom ic and p o l i t i c a l

36. Shou ld U k r a i n e b e faced w i t h a n exogenous shock, ad jus tmen t wou ld b e 
comp l icated by the recen t build-up o f a strong fo re ign exchange exposure in the

households, are n o t hedged against a possible exchange ra te devaluation. T h e N B U ’ s de 
facto p e g against the U S do l la r has arguably reduced these bo r rowe rs ’ perceptions o f 
exchange rate risk and thus fue l led the process o f do l la r iza t ion . This puts t h e NBU in a 
d i lemma : 
in case o f an ex te rna l (or po l i t ica l ) shock, there m a y b e pressure o n the 
exchange rate, but a la rge co r rec t ion w o u l d in turn cause d i f f i c u l t i e s f o r many banks. 
H o w i t reacts depends o n whe the r i t sees the shock as tempo ra ry and manageable o r 
whether i t i s permanent and requires adjustment. 

37. T h e NBU intends to move towa rds g rea te r exchange r a t e f lex ib i l i ty but has left 

the t ime f rame open. Cen t ra l bankers p o i n t t o the current p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty , the

cond i t ions f o r an ac t ive mone ta ry p o l i c y ( inc lud ing by inc reas ing the c i rcu la t ion and 
liquidity o f government securities and the development o f a y i e l d curve) as arguments 
against a r a p i d change in the mone ta ry f ramewo rk . Howeve r , in the event o f a nega t ive

Box 3: Euro 2012 

Be tween 800,000 and 900,000 spectators are expected to visit Uk ra in ian stadiums fo r the Eu ro 
2012. A round 200,000 tourists are anticipated and their add i t iona l spending may to ta l UAH 1 
b i l l i o n (US$0.2 b i l l ion ) or 0.2 percent o f 2006 GDP . D i rec t spending on the renova t ion o f 
stadiums and o n additional security measures may amount t o around UAH 10-15 b i l l i o n (US$2-3 
b i l l ion ) , w i t h government spending needs estimated at around UAH 8 b i l l i o n (ma in ly fo r security 
and fo r the renovation o f the K y i v O lymp ic stadium). 
In addition, Uk ra ine has to invest in infrastructure wh ich i s no t d irec t ly related to football, such as 
creating 30,000-50,000 ho te l beds, reconstructing airports, bu i ld ing roads and modern iz ing 
railroads. The precise requirements imposed o n Uk ra ine by the European Soccer Association 
(UEFA) are no t known, and re l iab le cost estimates are d i f f icu l t to obtain. Nonetheless, i t i s clear 
that the Euro 2012 i s likely to swa l low a considerable share o f the pub l ic investment budget and 
may in add i t ion catalyze significant pr iva te investment. The po ten t ia l pos i t ive impac t o n growth, 
p r iva te investment and the long- term modern iza t ion o f Uk ra ine i s important, but the r i s k s o f 
ove r ly cos t ly and misguided investments and o f macroeconomic imbalances resu l t ing f r om the

45. Uk ra ine ’s public sector i s one o f the largest among o the r lowe r -m idd le income 
countries, ye t the qua l i ty o f service de l ive ry i s rega rded as highly def ic ient by i t s 

popu lat ion . As a round 42 percent o f GDP, p u b l i c sector spending in U k r a i n e i s around

evidence, U k r a i n e ranks near the b o t t om o f a l l countries in E C A in terms o f p u b l i c 
perceptions o f the q u a l i t y o f hea l th and education services.’ S im i la r ly , the P A Y G 
pens ion system swa l lows a round 14 percent o f GDP, but replacement rates are l ow , and 
decreases w i th rising incomes, reduc ing comp l iance incentives. 

46. I n contrast to l a rg e a n d r i s ing pub l ic consumption a n d t rans fe r spending, public 
cap i ta l spending i s low a n d b ad l y p r io r i t i z ed a n d managed . Sub t rac t ing state

years, less than h a l f the l e v e l in the new EU membe r states and around one fifth o f the

ou t p u b l i c investment, but even the l im i t e d investment that does take p lace suffers f r o m a 
highly discretionary, unp red ic tab le and p o o r l y executed cap i ta l budge t ing process.

Box 4: T h e Recent Evo lu t ion o f Public Procurement 

In 2005, Uk ra ine spent more than US$4 b i l l ion , around 5 percent o f GDP, o n pub l ic procurement. 
The existence o f regu la tory framework that guarantees a transparent, compe t i t ive and thereby 
cost-effective process i s thus o f considerable importance fo r the coun try . 
Until late 2004, Ukra ine ’s pub l ic procurement system underwen t a process o f gradual 
improvements, w i t h the number of tenders conducted on an open basis, increasing f r om 7 percent 
Gust under 50 percent o f to ta l value) in 2002 t o 26 percent (69 percent o f to ta l value). Sole- 
source contracts were correspondingly reduced to 10 percent o f t h e to ta l (15 percent o f value). 
A series o f amendments to the pub l ic procurement l a w in Novembe r 2004, June 2005, December 
2005, and December 2006 have seriously d i lu ted and fragmented government procurement 
au thor i ty . 
Impo r tan t functions have been transferred f r om the Au tho r iz ing Agency in the 
M i n i s t r y o f Economy to the Center fo r Tender Procedures and Business P lann ing (CTP), a N o n - 
Governmental Organ iza t ion (NGO), no t subject to t h e same con tro ls rou t ine ly imposed o n bodies 
o f pub l ic administration. The CTP o f f ic ia l ly ho lds patents and copyrights fo r numerous bidding 
documents, inc lud ing standard bidding documents near ly iden t ica l to those o f the W o r l d Bank, 
wh ich i t sells to bidders against a fee . Ma rke t par t ic ipan ts comp la in o f pressure by the CTP to 
use the ir copyr igh ted documents and to pay fo r questionable services, inc lud ing commissions o n 
successful bids. Moreover, the fully decentralized pub l ic procurement system has created 
s ign i f ican t capacity problems among p rocu r ing entities. M a r k e t participants comp la in about 
insu f f ic ien t access to in forma t ion , unclear bidding documents, insu f f ic ien t time to prepare bids, 
un jus t i f ied cance l la t ion o f tender procedures, and frequent delays in contractual payments. 
Such practices have discouraged compe t i t ion and g iven r i s e to s ign i f ican t governance concerns. 
Supervisory func t ions are another ma jo r concern, Supervisory functions were transferred by 
lega l amendments in 2005 f r om the Au tho r iz ing Agency t o the con t ro l and rev is ion unit o f the 
M o F and the Accoun t ing Chamber, creating con f l ic ts o f interest, since the procurement entities 
were n o w supervised by the same bodies that also audit them. In December 2006, further lega l 
amendments created a Special Con t ro l Commission. However, the decisions o f the comm iss ion 
can b e challenged by the CTP in court, fur ther enhancing the powers o f th is non-government 
body . 
The need fo r Uk ra ine to fundamentally overhaul the present system and r e t u r n to the pa th o f 
harmon iz ing i t s pub l ic procurement rules with acceptable in terna t iona l prac t ice i s increas ing ly 
recognized. I t i s a tr igger in the W o r l d Bank ’s DPL p rog ram and also a cond i t ion fo r Uk ra ine t o 
receive budget support f r om the EC . A new dra f t l aw has been prepared and i t i s to be hoped that 
i t w o u l d be adopted soon in t h e new parliament, tak ing in to account in terna t iona l best practice.

People’s t r u s t in the state i s l o w and the i r w i l l ingness t o support the m o v e towards greater

the analysis presented above suggests that imp rovemen ts in p u b l i c services w i l l need t o 
come p r im a r i l y f r o m a r e f o rm in f inanc ing arrangements and greater l o c a l accoun tab i l i ty . 
Yet, these re fo rms are n o t p r io r i t ies f o r the m a j o r i t y o f the popu la t ion , w h i l e the 
corresponding s ta f f ing and structural changes are l i k e l y t o run i n t o the resistance o f

This consensus has rema ined at the core o f government p o l i c y th roughou t recent p o l i t i c a l

med ium - te rm p rog ram prepared by the c o a l i t i o n government be tween the Reg ions Party, 
the Socialist Pa r ty o f U k r a i n e and the Commun is t Pa r ty o f Uk ra ine . Tab le 4 compares 
the m a i n p i l l a r s o f these three strategic documents by p rog ramma t ic themes. T h i s 
demonstrates the consensus that exists around k e y themes, such as im p r o v i n g the

T h e C A S Comp le t ion R e p o r t (CAS CR) 
64. T h e C A S CR notes th a t the C A S was b road ly a l igned w i t h the deve lopment 
p r io r i t ies expressed in Uk ra ine ’s “Eu ropean Choice” agenda deve loped in 2003 

(Annex 3). T h e robustness o f th is cons t ruc t ion i s apparent in the fac t tha t the authorities 
and the B a n k j o i n t l y agreed n o t t o change the assistance f ramewo rk during the m i d - t e rm 
r e v i ew in 2005, a l though the Gove rnmen t h a d changed in the mean t ime f o l l ow i n g the 
“Orange Revo lu t ion ” o f la te 2004. 

65. U k r a in e , over the p e r iod o f the 2003-2007 CAS , achieved o r even exceeded 
m a n y o f the long - te rm deve lopment outcomes set as targets u n d e r the C A S . G r ow t h 

exceeded projections, p u b l i c debt leve ls declined, and U k r a i n e made s ign i f ican t progress 
in trade l ibe ra l iza t ion and f inanc ia l sector development. T h e p o l i t i c a l changes at the end 
o f 2004 b rough t s ign i f ican t imp rovemen ts in med ia freedoms and the expression o f 
p o l i t i c a l voices. In the soc ia l dimension, progress was m ixed , as the s ign i f ican t reduc t ion 
in pove r ty was n o t ma tched by s im i la r progress in other soc ia l ind ica to rs . 

66. T h e ove ra l l positive assessment notw ithstand ing , the C A S CR h igh l ights the 
va r iab i l i ty o f results across p i l la rs a n d areas o f engagement. Thus w o r k o n 

mac roeconom ic stabilization, f inanc ia l sector development and in te rna t iona l in teg ra t ion 
was successful, whereas w o r k t o im p r o v e corporate governance and the env i ronmen t f o r 
p r iva te sector development, was less successful. W h i l e p o v e r t y reduc t ion was achieved 
as a resu l t o f r i s i n g incomes, the m u c h needed r e f o rm o f soc ia l assistance and insurance 
systems advanced less r a p i d l y than had been hoped fo r . S im i l a r v a r i a b i l i t y in outcomes 
i s observed within the soc ia l sectors, with some progress in access t o education but 
l im i t e d advances in the r e f o rm o f hea l th care, the containment o f the HIV/AIDS and TB 
epidemics, o r in im p r o v e d q u a l i t y o f m u n i c i p a l services. T h e p u b l i c sector governance 
agenda advanced in the area o f p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, but s ta l led in p u b l i c

By contrast, inves tmen t l e n d i n g con t r ibu ted o n l y m a r g i n a l l y t o the achievement o f results

B o x 5: Po r t fo l io Performance and the Investment Lend ing Rev iew 

During the C A S period, s ix new investment loans were approved and new commitments 
amounted to US$629 m i l l ion , around h a l f o f the total. Disbursements however were on ly 
US$241 m i l l ion , o r around 21 percent o f to ta l disbursements. The to ta l investment loan po r t fo l io 
remained steady at between 11-12 operations, o f wh ich 3-4 were in p rob lem status in each year o f 
the CAS . Projects at risk thus accounted fo r around one t h i r d o f t h e total, w i t h commitments at 
risk rising through the C A S pe r iod to 46 percent in F Y 0 7 ( large ly because the single largest 
operation - the Ru ra l L a n d T i t l i n g and Cadastre Deve lopmen t pro jec t - moved in to the risk 
category in that year). 
Ukra ine ’s po r t fo l io has consistently been one o f the weakest in the region, with high risk levels, 
l o w disbursements, l o n g preparation times, effectiveness delays and a large number o f dropped 
projects. Under these circumstances i t i s no t surprising that investment lend ing has no t 
con tr ibu ted e f fec t ive ly to ach iev ing C A S r e s u l t s . T o beg in to address these challenges, the Bank 
carried out an Investment Lend ing Rev iew in 2005. The 2005 Investment Lending Review 
proposed to: (a) restructure o r cancel non-per form ing projects; (b) reduce the ins t i tu t iona l 
comp l ica t ion o f investment projects; (c) move to a greater use o f coun try systems; (e) encourage 
the government to simplify i ts procedures, and (f) imp rove in te rna l coord ina t ion within the Bank 
teams. 
The Bank and the government have advanced in c lean ing up the po r t fo l io o f Bank projects 
through cancellations o r re-programming. In addition, new operations have sharper objectives 
and a re less ins t i tu t iona l ly loaded, wh ich should make i t easier to imp lemen t and evaluate r e s u l t s . 
Greater u s e o f coun try systems i s mak ing progress by s k f t i n g disbursements under a l l projects 
w i t h the central government t o the treasury. Nonetheless, disbursement rates, a l though 
improv ing , rema in low, and preparation and imp lemen ta t ion times are well above E C A and B a n k 
averages. The new performance standards developed j o i n t l y by the Bank and the authorities 
during the 2007 CPPWCPS are designed to address the persistent problems in investment 
lending.

progress came about th rough a comb ina t ion o f in tens ive d ia logue supported by

c. CPS PILLARS AND OBJECTIVES 
87. I n response to the development challenges summarized in Section 111, this CPS 

proposes a t w o pillar strategy of support. T h e f i r s t p i l l a r has the ove ra l l ob jec t ive t o

T h e second p i l la r ’s ob jec t ive i s the r e f o rm o f p u b l i c finance and adm in is t ra t ion and the

t o m a x im i z e synergies across thema t ic areas and at the same t im e emphasize se lec t iv i ty 
in the cho ice o f programs. 

88 . The CPS emphasizes the strong links and synergies between increasing 
investments in infrastructure on the one hand, and improvements in the investment 
climate and in conditions for private businesses on the other. Im p r o v e d in f ras t ruc tu re 

services have a d i rec t pos i t ive impac t o n the inves tmen t c l ima te . At the same time,

address k e y in f ras t ruc tu re needs. 

89 . Similarly, the CPS emphasizes the links between reforming public finance and 
public administration and improvements in the quality o f public services. Only i f 

budgets are allocated in a w a y tha t rewards good performers, and spend ing units are

this strategy i s t o use the re fo rms o f p u b l i c f inanc ia l management and the adm in is t ra t ion 
o f social assistance and insurance as en t ry po in ts i n t o a d ia logue o n i m p r o v i n g p u b l i c

Weak governance and widespread co r rup t ion pose a serious developmental challenge for 
Uk ra ine . Howeve r an in terna l review o f the degree o f vu lne rab i l i ty o f the Bank’s po r t fo l io t o the 
country’s f iduc iary r i s k s has found that these can be m i t iga ted to acceptable pro jec t levels. 
T h r e e b road strategic recommendations fo l low : (i) The W o r l d Bank response to the G A C 
challenge must rema in pragmatic and gradualist until new opportunities emerge; (ii) g iven the 
current imp lemen ta t ion and ins t i tu t iona l obstacles, as w e l l as the l a c k o f a broad-based po l i t ica l 
consensus, na t iona l- leve l governance re forms need t o be addressed through e f for ts to strengthen 
the demand fo r good governance in add i t ion t o standard investment lending instruments; (iii) the 
G A C agenda shou ld be imp lemen ted as cross-cutting themes through the WBG’s p o l i c y lend ing 
p la t form , and as design and imp lemen ta t ion features in the investment operations 
for 
in fras truc ture and pub l ic service delivery. 
These strategic recommendations have t h e f o l l ow i n g operational imp l ica t ions fo r t h e WBG’s 
engagement in Ukra ine : 
1) Ad jus tmen t o f the po r t fo l io in the short- to med ium- term towards capacity building o f c i v i l 
society and loca l stakeholders. The Bank w i l l a im to scale-up successful p i lo ts l l k e the People ’s 
Vo ice pro jec t and develop further the synergies with other sectors (housing, u t i l i t i e s , etc.). The 
Bank w i l l propose new ins t i tu t ion -bu i ld ing loans to the central government beyond those already 
in the p ipe l ine on ly when i t judges prospects fo r successful imp lemen ta t ion are reasonable, with 
reference in the f i r s t instance to needed improvements o f ex is t ing lend ing interventions in t h i s 
area. 
2) A s ign i f ican t amount o f resources w i l l be allocated to non- lend ing activities. The purpose of 
th is w o r k w i l l be to strengthen and broaden demand fo r good governance. Among the vehicles to 
support th is ob jec t ive w i l l be the ta i lo r ing to Ukra ine ’s context and dissemination of reports 
distilling in terna t iona l po l icy lessons, as t h e recent ‘‘Many Faces of Corrup t ion” , as w e l l as 
con t inu ing w o r k with NGOs and c i v i l society. 
3) The B a n k w i l l i n t e n s i f y i t s wo rk w i t h loca l governments, wh ich are seen in some areas as more 
e f fec t ive counterparts. Given that most government-provided pub l ic goods are de l ivered at the 
loca l level, such an approach may de l iver results faster and propagate i tse l f through 
demonstration effects. 
4) The Bank w i l l in tens i fy efforts to move towards SWAPS and disbursements through the budget 
as a means to increase the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f i ts assistance. As imp l ied by P E F A 
indicators, disbursing through the budget in Uk ra ine appears to be re la t ive ly l o w risk and may 
generate benefits o f greater country ownership, more e f f ic ien t processing and u l t ima te ly deliver 
results more e f fec t ive ly . However, deve lop ing a roadmap towa rd th is approach w i l l requ ire 
s ign i f ican t add i t iona l e f fo r t to strengthen strategic p lann ing capacity in partner m i n i s t r i e s and to 
a l ign W o r l d Bank and country processes. 
5 ) T o m i t iga te f iduc ia ry risks in Bank operations, the strategy envisions strengthening ex is t ing 
f iduc ia ry standards, such as en forc ing the Bank’s procurement rules, compe t i t ive bidding, as well 
as adequate supervision and attention to capacity building among pro jec t counterparts. 
Innova t ive ways to track money flows and build accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms in to pro jec t d e s i g n 
such as Pub l ic Expenditure T rack ing Surveys, stakeholder invo lvemen t in pro jec t governance o r 
independent technical audits w i l l need to be explored o n a case-by-case basis tak ing in to account 
resource constraints and the need to avo id add ing add i t iona l comp lex i ty to pro jec t design in the 
Uk ra in ian context.

E. RESULTS, MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

118. T h e u l t ima te success o f the Bank ’s strategy in U k r a i n e must be measu red 
against the economic outcomes o r results achieved. U k r a i n e has in the past tended t o 

p e r f o rm w e l l o n mac roeconom ic results, even i f c ruc ia l p o l i c y milestones were delayed. 
At the same time, the extent t o w h i c h th is can b e a t t r ibu ted to the Bank ’s o r other donors’ 
presence in U k r a i n e i s d i f f i c u l t t o fully ascertain. The C A S C R po in ts ou t that the results 

41 

f ramewo rk in the p rev ious CAS did n o t take su f f ic ien t account o f the inves tmen t lend ing 
p o r t f o l i o . 
I t also po in ts ou t that in m a n y cases, the m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion 
f ramewo rks f o r i n d i v i d u a l l e n d i n g operations need strengthening. 

119. This CPS includes a results matrix (Annex 7), which w i l l serve as the main 
accountability framework during implementation. T h e m a t r i x l i n k s the WBG lending 

and non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies t o spec i f ic econom ic outcomes, and specifies target values for 
each outcome. These are then re la ted t o longe r - te rm coun t ry l e v e l outcomes and t o the 
obstacles that need t o b e ove rcome t o mee t these outcomes. 
There i s a close 
correspondence be tween these obstacles and the analysis o f development challenges in 
Sec t ion I11 and Annex 1 and 2 o f the CPS.

121. T h e need to r em a i n f lex ib le imposes modesty o n the results f ramewo rk . T h e 
Bank , in several instances, m a y n o t b e able t o c omm i t m o r e than imp rovemen ts in

F. CONSULTATION PROCESS 

123. T h e B a n k t e am has conducted a series o f consultations w i t h d i f fe ren t 
stakeholders on the design o f the CPS. T h e basic p r inc ip les o f the CPS we re presented 
t o the authorities at the CPPR in M a r c h 2007, and the present d ra f t was ex tens ive ly 
discussed and rev iewed w i th the authorities. Round tab le discussions we re h e l d in Kyiv 
during M a y and Oc tobe r 2007, with donors and with c i v i l society, and the full CPS draft 
was posted o n the Bank ’s external website f o r three weeks in September-October 2007. 
T h e B a n k also presented the same ma te r ia l t o representatives o f a l l m a j o r p o l i t i c a l parties 
and conducted f i v e reg iona l consultations in Donetsk, K h a r k i v , Lv iv and Lutsk and 
S im fe ropo l . In addition, the B a n k team held i n f o rm a l discussions o n d i f fe ren t economic 
and p o l i t i c a l development scenarios and the r o l e o f the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y w i th a 
group o f independent p o l i t i c a l analysts. 

124. T h e consu ltat ion process h e l d to date has con f i rmed s ign if icant support fo r the 
Bank ’s approach . In pa r t icu la r , participants endorsed the p r i n c i p l e o f greater se lec t iv i ty 
in the Bank ’s in te rven t ions . T h e greater emphasis o n in f ras t ruc tu re l e n d i n g in the

n o t t o abandon the soc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm agendas. 
In response, the B a n k 
c la r i f ied tha t i t w o u l d change the m i x o f instruments but n o t the degree o f engagement o n 
social and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms and emphasized the impo r tance o f close dono r

some expressed a v i e w that the CPS shou ld adopt the strengthening o f c i v i l society as a

imp rovemen ts in governance m a y con t inue t o b e s l ow g i v e n s t rong vested interests, and 
argued f o r a p ragma t ic approach that fa i led t o ra ise un rea l is t ic expectations. There was 
general agreement that f inanc ia l support t o the government, th rough l e n d i n g operations,

VI. RISKS A N D R I S K MITIGATION 

A. IMPLEMENTATION 
RISKS 

126. Imp lemen ta t ion risks in U k r a i n e a r e considerable. 

T h e t rack reco rd o f 
imp lemen ta t ion , pa r t icu la r ly in the inves tmen t l e n d i n g po r t fo l io , i s poo r . U k r a i n e has the 
lowes t disbursement rates among any IBRD bo r rowe r , a l though there have been some 
s ign i f ican t recent improvements. 

127. T h e m a i n sources o f imp lemen ta t ion risk f a l l in to th ree categories: (i) l a c k o f 
ownersh ip , (ii) cumbersome in t e rn a l procedures wh ich a re inconsistent w i t h W o r l d 
B a n k procedures, a n d (E) po l icy delays o r reversals. 

128. Owne rsh ip : T h e capacity o f Uk ra ine ’s government f o r strategic p l a n n i n g rema ins 
r e l a t i v e l y weak. 
T h e authorities have been m a k i n g e f fo r ts t o im p r o v e in te rna l 
coordination, but strategic p r i o r i t i z a t i o n remains a challenge. In th is environment, i t i s 
sometimes d i f f i c u l t t o ascertain the extent o f c l ien t owne rsh ip f o r a pa r t icu la r 
in te rven t ion . Yet, the B a n k has in the past also been culpable o f p repa r ing l e n d i n g 
operations at the request o f l i n e ministries, w i t h o u t v e r i f ym g the extent o f support (and o r 
p o l i t i c a l resistance) by powe r b roke rs in the cen t ra l government agencies (Cabinet o f 
M in is te rs , M oF , Ministry o f Economy). 

45 

129. T h e current CPS imposes greater l im i t s o n the numbe r o f n e w p ro jec ts b e i n g 
prepared, thereby f o r c i n g the authorities t o coordinate m o r e e f fec t ive ly . T h i s has already 
been in evidence in p repa ra t ion o f the CPS, w h e n the Gove rnmen t i n t e r n a l l y agreed t o a 
clear sequence f o r the p repa ra t ion and app rova l o f three ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm p ro jec ts in 
the lend ing p ipe l ine : Cou r t Mode rn iza t ion , P F M R e f o rm and Soc ia l Insurance 
Adm in is t ra t ion Mode rn iza t ion . In addition, the Gove rnmen t c l a r i f i e d tha t they w o u l d n o t 
consider ask ing f o r support f o r c i v i l service r e f o rm until 2010, w h i c h i s consistent with 
B a n k s t a f f eva lua t ion that the p o l i t i c a l consensus t o push f o rw a r d c i v i l service r e f o rm 
does n o t ye t exist. T h e recent imp rovemen ts in coo rd ina t ion with W o r l d B a n k assistance 
by the authorities are pa r t o f a general e f fo r t , as re f lec ted in the e labo ra t ion o f a 
Gove rnmen t Strategy f o r Coope ra t ion w i th IFIs, adopted in 2006. 

130. T h e CPS also a ims f o r greater owne rsh ip o f the AAA w o r k and the p lanned 
I n n o v a t i o n Fund w o u l d b e the strongest expression o f a new pa r tne rsh ip whe re c l ien t co - 
de te rm ina t ion o f the focus areas f o r B a n k adv iso ry services w o u l d resu l t in greater 
impact. 

13 1. Cumbe rsome procedures: U k r a i n e has a b ew i l d e r i n g a r ray o f in te rna l procedures 
and eve ry step in p ro jec t p repa ra t ion requires a consu l ta t ive in te r -m in is te r ia l process that 
can last several months. Mo reove r , I F 1 p ro jec ts with the excep t ion o f the D P L , are n o t 
inc luded in the annual budge t and hence each p ro jec t requires r a t i f i c a t i o n by the Rada, 
w h i c h again delays p ro jec t effectiveness by several months. 

132. T h e Bank and the gove rnmen t have started a dialogue o n simplifying na t iona l 
procedures and m o v i n g towa rds the use o f coun t ry systems on a selected basis, whe re 
f i d u c i a r y r isks are though t t o b e manageable. A s an i n i t i a l success o f th is dialogue, the 
government recen t ly passed a reso lu t ion manda t ing the disbursement o f W o r l d Bank 
funds th rough the N a t i o n a l Treasury. Mo reove r , the 2007 CPPR has c omm i t t e d b o t h 
sides t o clear service standards in p o r t f o l i o m o n i t o r i n g and imp lemen ta t ion (B o x 7). An 
imp rovemen t in the disbursement ra te t o 12 percent and general p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance 
standards are base case cond i t ions o f the CPS. 

133. Po l icy delays o r reversals: T h e pace o f p o l i c y r e f o rm in U k r a i n e has by and la rge 
fa l len short o f expectations. This has affected the sequence o f DPLs , w h i c h have tended 
t o take at least tw o years t o prepare. T h e annual disbursement schedule foreseen in the 
CPS m a y thus b e regarded as amb i t ious . 

134. T h e r i s k i s m i t iga ted at least in part by a reca l ib ra t ion o f the D P L program. 
Compared t o close t o 100 benchmarks and ove r 2 0 triggers in the P A L 2 p rog ram , D P L I1 
contains o n l y 8 p r i o r actions and six triggers. Mo reove r , the D P L f i am ew o r k i s f lex ib le ; 
triggers can b e wa ived i f r e f o rm progress i s delayed in one area, but th is i s compensated 
by greater progress in another area. T h e reca l ib ra t ion of the D P L p rog ram i s re f lec ted in 
the smaller share that adjustment l e n d i n g takes in the ove ra l l CPS envelope, and in the 
smaller size o f each D P L re la t ive t o the size o f the budget o r the economy. Thus w h i l e 
the economy has t r i p l e d in size in U S do l la r terms since 2000, the average D P L size o f 

46 

US$300-400 m i l l i o n i s n o t m u c h h ighe r than the average size o f p rev ious adjustment 
operations.

T h e m a i n r i s k s f r o m a mac roeconom ic perspective inc lude : 

Adverse te rms o f t rade shock: With m e t a l p r ices at reco rd highs, the impac t 
o f rising energy im p o r t costs has been mu ted . Shou ld this change, U k r a i n e 
w o u l d face w i d e n i n g current account de f ic i t , reduced corporate p r o f i t a b i l i t y ,

Reduced access to in te rna t iona l f inanc ing: U k r a i n e has bene f i ted f r o m a

Shou ld p o r t f o l i o preferences shift against eme rg ing markets, 
U k r a i n e w o u l d b e vu lne rab le b o t h because o f the reliance o n external f inanc ing

F isca l expansion d r i v en by popu l ist politics: F isca l management t o date has 
been conservative, but p o l i t i c a l i n s t a b i l i t y has l e d t o e lec t ion promises that i f

Specifically, i t i s l i k e l y that in the face o f s t rong negative terms o f trade shock, the

Shou ld external cond i t ions deteriorate m o r e gradually, the NBU would have t im e t o

BOX Al.1: K E Y CHALLENGES IN PENSION REFORM 
Like many other countries in the region, U k r a i n e has a P A Y G pens ion system w i t h several prob lema t ic features. 
The U k r a i n i a n system features a conven t iona l ly de f ined bene f i t f o rm u l a w i t h generous replacement rates, l o w 
re t iremen t ages (60 fo r m e n and 55 f o r women), t h e full old-age pens ion en t i t lemen t based o n 20 years o f service 
f o r women and 25 years f o r men, and numerous ear ly re t iremen t prov is ions . H i g h con t r ibu t ion rates to finance 
th is system and caps imposed o n m a x im um pensions t o keep the system in balance have discouraged comp l iance 
and l e d to a lmos t f la t b e n e f i t s . In 2004, s ign i f ican t increases in the minimum pens ion h i k e d pens ion spending 
from 9 percen t o f GDP in 2003 to 15 percent in 2005 and the resu l t ing pens ion h n d de f ic i t , reached 3.3 percent 
o f GDP . Since then, parame tr ic adjustments and a conservative indexa t ion fo rmu la have reduced pens ion fund 
spending and closed the de f ic i t . Compliance, as measured by the share o f con tr ibu t ions co l lec ted f r om the 
declared wage bill, has also improved . Nonetheless, the P A Y G system remains ine f f ic ien t (due to incentives to 
under-declare incomes), u n f a i r (due t o negative rates o f re tu rn f o r con tr ibu tors over the l o n g run- replacement 
rates are expected to f a l l f r om the presently 45 percent t o 27 percen t in the l o n g run, w h i l e the con t r ibu t ion ra te 
f o r wage earners i s 34 percent) and unsustainable over the med ium - te rm (due to demographic developments) 
In 2003-2004, a series o f leg is la t ion was passed in t roduc ing a m u l t i - p i l l a r pens ion system, w i t h a manda tory fully 
funded second p i l la r . However , in t roduc t ion o f the second p i l l a r has been delayed because o f a p r o v i s i o n that i t 
can o n l y be in troduced i f the f i rs t p i l l a r i s in full balance. Spec i f ic arrangements, inc lud ing con t r ibu t ion rates i n t o 
the second p i l la r , adm in is tra t ive issues , f inanc ing o f the trans i t iona l de f ic i t , and the t im i n g o f the re form , rema in 
to be c l a r i f i e d by add i t iona l leg is la t ion (the corresponding L a w “On Imp lemen ta t ion o f Cumu la t ive System o f 
Ob l iga to ry State Pension Insurance” was passed in f i rs t read ing in April 2007). One concern i s that the U k r a i n i a n 
cap i ta l markets m a y n o t be s trong ly developed enough to absorb a large i n f l o w o f pens ion fund investments. This 
requires improvemen ts in the regu la t ion o f cap i ta l markets and increases in the supply o f l ow - r i s k domestic 
government bonds in pa ra l le l with preparations f o r the in t roduc t ion o f a second p i l l a r . The government has also 
reduced the p lanned rate for manda tory second p i l l a r con tr ibu t ions t o 2 percent, w h i c h w i l l l i m i t i n i t i a l i n f l ow s 
i n t o the system. 
In add i t ion to ensuring the cond i t ions fo r a successful in t roduc t ion o f a m u l t i - p i l l a r pens ion system are in place, 
Governmen t faces the add i t iona l challenge t o in troduce parame tr ic changes to the P A Y G system to ensure i t s 
f inanc ia l sus ta inab i l i ty over the long - te rm and re-establish a connec t ion b e tw e e n con tr ibu t ions and benefits 
to 
imp rove fairness and compliance. K e y W o r l d B a n k recommendations inc lude : (a) increase in re t iremen t age for 
women, (b) reduc t ion o f e l i g i b i l i t y fo r minimum pens ion f o r w o r k i n g pensioners, (c) better minimum pens ion 
targeting, (d) d i f fe ren t ia t ion o f t h e minimum pens ion leve l , (e) in t roduc t ion o f regular con t r ibu t ion rates f o r those 
o n simplified tax regime, and (0 reduc t ion in ear ly re t iremen t prov is ions . 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f these measures

a l l o f these 
imp rovemen ts have been sustained, suggesting 
that some o f the

6. Nonetheless, the process o f imp ro v ing governance has been g r adu a l r a th e r th an

support the G A C agenda i f i t p lays t o the i r advantage (e.g., in access t o in te rna t iona l 
cap i ta l markets), but have in the past resisted faster ins t i tu t iona l changes. Therefore, a

22. Bu i ld ing on these achievements, the second p i l l a r o f the cu r ren t CPS i s built

through the fac i l i ta t ion o f a series o f pro jec t ac t iv i t ies (training, reg iona l workshops, research, 
etc.) so that mun ic ipa l i t ies can become econom ica l ly se l f-su f f ic ien t and so that various c i t izen

crea t ion o f pro jec t stakeholder committees so that ideas are shared, areas o f common 
interest are iden t i f ied and fu ture pro jec t p lann ing i s agreed upon by loca l partners; 
building o f loca l research capacity o f NGO partners so that they can conduct the ir o w n 
research and carry out the mon i to r ing o f service delivery; 
crea t ion o f foca l po in ts fo r c i t izen engagement, such as commun i ty foundations and 
condom in ium associations; and 
development and d is t r ibu t ion o f bes t practices, in the f o rm o f guidelines and 
publications, so that methodologies can be accessed as a resource throughout the coun try 
and replicated in other cities. 
Beyond the loca l results associated with the c i t izen engagement efforts, the pro jec t has 
brough t about change in loca l service improvements, with three m a i n themes hav ing emerged 
i n v o l v i n g b o t h the ver t ica l and ho r izon ta l in tegra t ion o f pro jec t ac t iv i t ies and trends: (1)

LONGTERM DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES 

3 . Ukraine’s long-term development outcomes du r ing this CAS period compare 
favorably with the expectations set by the government program--“European Choice 
(2003). ” T h e C A S put f o r t h a summa ry set o f ind ica to rs t o assess progress in reach ing 
the long - te rm development outcomes unde r the “European Cho ice ” agenda. Tab le 1 o f 
this document compares them with the results achieved.32 T h e compa r ison shows that, 
despite an amb i t ious program, the m a j o r i t y o f the long - te rm deve lopmen t targets have 
been me t . 
4. Economic growth exceeded expectations. Econom ic growth, at 7.8 percent pe r 
annum f r o m 2003-2006, exceeded the expectation o f 5 t o 6 percent set unde r the CAS . 
De te r io ra t ion in the terms o f trade and curbed investors’ confidence, b rough t about by a 
series o f p o l i t i c a l realignments and changes o f government, s lowed d o w n economic 
g r ow t h in 2005 t o 2.7 percent. Since then, econom ic g r ow t h resumed-it was 7 .1 percent 
in 2006 and i s forecast by B a n k s t a f f t o reach 6.5 percent in 2007. G r ow t h i s l i k e l y t o b e 
above 5 percent f o r the m e d i um term. With hindsight, observers w o u l d seem t o have 
cons is ten t ly underestimated the po ten t ia l f o r economic recove ry and g r ow t h in Uk ra ine . 

3 2 Table A3.1 corresponds to Table 3, page 18 o f t h e CAS. This table itself i s a summary o f a broader set o f 
results expected under the government program and presented in Appendix B-9 o f the CAS. 

76 

O f ten ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm has been l i n k e d too tightly w i th short-term economic 
performance. In fact, the economy h a d su f f ic ien t r o o m t o g r ow despite the s low pace o f 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms overall, w h i l e k e y ins t i tu t iona l bottlenecks, such as so f t budget 
constraints, the ba r te r economy, and l a c k o f f isca l p o l i c y c red ib i l i ty , we re removed by the 
authorities in a t im e l y fashion.33 

5. The market has rewarded the strong f isca l position of 

the government. T h e 

ob jec t ive t o reduce ex te rna l p u b l i c debt was m e t handsomely: at 1 5 percent o f GDP, 
p u b l i c external debt i s n o w b e l ow the c e i l i n g set by the gove rnmen t p rog ram (40 percent 
o f GDP).34 A r e l a t i v e l y tight f isca l po l icy , o n average, and r a p i d econom ic growth, 
he lped l ow e r the ex te rna l debt burden. T h e g rad ing o f sove re ign paper in in te rna t iona l 
f inanc ia l markets has imp roved . Standard and Poor’s and F i t c h b o t h rate long - te rm 
sovereign debt o f the government at BB-. P o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty i s the m a i n concern o f 
investors today. M o o d y ’ s recen t ly increased i t s r a t i n g t o B1 f r o m Ba3, after conduc t ing a 
tho rough r e v i ew o f the b a n k i n g sector.35 The gove rnmen t has easier access t o 
in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l markets. F o r instance, i t p laced in June 2007 US$500 m i l l i o n 
do l la rs in f i v e year bonds at 6.385 percent. T h e tight f isca l p o s i t i o n and the stable 
exchange ra te have con t r ibu ted t o a reduc t ion o f i n f l a t i o n . Recently, however, the sharp 
increases in energy p r ices have pushed i n f l a t i o n back i n t o doub le digits. T h e l e v e l o f 
in te rna t iona l reserves s tood at around US$26 b i l l i o n at the end o f June 2007 , w h i c h was 
equivalent t o around f o u r mon ths o f impo r ts . 

6 .The f inanc ia l sector i s stronger and deeper, although there a re still risks. The g r ow t h 

and deepening o f the f inanc ia l sector also proceeded at a pace faster than had been 
foreseen. C red i t t o G D P wen t f r o m 26 .6 percent in 2003 t o 48.4 percent in 2006 . The 
r a t i o o f deposits t o G D P wen t f r o m 17.1 percent t o 3 3 percent. Compe t i t ion , b o t h 
domestic and foreign, has made the sector stronger. A process o f b a n k conso l ida t ion i s 
underway. T h e resu l t o f this compe t i t ion has been a decrease in the in the in te rmed ia t ion 
ma rg ins f o r loans in l o c a l cu r rency ( f r om 9.9 percent in 2003 t o 7 . 2 percent in 2 0 0 6 . ) 
This said, however, there are concerns that the r a p i d g r ow t h o f c red i t in the economy m a y 
be weaken ing bank p o r t f o l i o s and that the exposure o f t h e banking system in fo re ign 
currency m a y b e too high. Howeve r , the high l e v e l o f in te rna t iona l reserves p rov ides a 
cush ion t o manage sw ings in f inanc ia l investment preferences. 

7 . Poverty dropped rapidly over the CASpe r iod . There has been a s ign i f ican t reduc t ion 

in the pove r ty rate; p o v e r t y leve ls n o w stand at 8 percent o f the popu la t ion , l o w by any 
standards.36 In addition, in l i n e with the government program, p o v e r t y decreased among 
c r i t ica l groups l i k e t h e e lde r ly and the r u r a l popu la t ion . Salaries increased by 77 percent 

33 The Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) f o r F Y 0 8 through FY 1 1 presents this p o i n t in greater detail. 
3 4 I t should be noted, however, that im p l i c i t pub l ic l iab i l i t ies in the pens ion system as w e l l as in the so- 
ca l led los t savings o f the fo rme r Soviet Sberbank are considerable, i f con t ingen t - see Pub l ic Finance 
Rev iew (2006). 
35 At the beg inn ing o f the C A S period, the F i t c h ra t ing was B+, S&P B, and M o o d y ’ s B2.

during the CAS period, above  expectation^.^^ T h e rea l increase in pensions was 34.8 
percent in 2004 and 28.9 percent in 2005. The r a p i d increase in salaries comb ined with 
increases in social transfers (pensions and assistance) la rge ly explains the decrease in 
p o v e r t y rates. 
8. The re have been improvements in the education system although quality remains a 
concern. T h e coverage o f p re -schoo l education i s m u c h b roade r now , a l though i t s t i l l 
lags in r u r a l areas. In addition, en ro l lmen t and comp le t ion rates in secondary and te r t ia ry 
education are higher. A r o u n d t w o thirds o f the 18-21 year coho r t i s en ro l led in higher 
education. Howeve r , the educational system does n o t seem t o b e p r o v i d i n g either the 
sk i l ls o r the qua l i ty needed by the labo r ma rke t . Tha t said, there i s keen awareness that 
the coun t ry needs t o im p r o v e education outcomes t o sustain a pa t te rn o f high p r o d u c t i v i t y 
g row th . 
9 . Progress on health has not met national expectations. T h e coun t ry m e t the targets 
the CAS set o n ma te rna l and c h i l d mo r ta l i ty . Howeve r , l i f e expectancy has n o t 
recuperated f r o m the substantial d rop ea r ly during the t rans i t ion process and the wedge 
be tween m a l e and fema le l i f e expectancy i s w e l l above EU o r m i d d l e income coun t ry 
averages. A k e y concern in hea l th and educa t ion i s the eme rg ing gap in the q u a l i t y o f 
service d e l i v e r y be tween r u r a l and u rban areas. Reg re t fu l ly , the fight against TB and 
AIDS inc idence has stalled; and ind ica to rs have ac tua l ly worsened. 
10. Uk ra ine i s more integrated into the rest of 
the world. T h e g r ow t h o f trade (both 
exports and impo r ts ) exceeded GD P g r ow t h ove r the CAS pe r iod . The EU and the U S 
have declared U k r a i n e a ma rke t economy, U k r a i n e i s close t o j o i n i n g the W T O , f o r 
w h i c h goa l successive governments across the p o l i t i c a l spectrum have pushed th rough a 
sometimes con t rove rs ia l leg is la t ive agenda. T h e ob jec t ive o f j o i n i n g the WTO has been a 
k e y d r i v e r in ach iev ing ins t i tu t iona l change. Howeve r , U k r a i n e has made l i t t l e progress 
ove r the CAS pe r iod in the geographic d ive rs i f ica t ion o f exports. T h e share o f to ta l trade 
with the EU has rema ined r o u g h l y constant at a round 30 percent be tween 2002 and 2005, 
w h i l e Russia’s share has recen t ly been g r ow i n g thanks t o buoyan t demand in Russia and 
rising im p o r t costs o f Russ ian energy supplies. 
11. The re have been gains in governance i n selected areas, in particular, vo ice and 
accoun tab i l i ty and transparency. Va r ious in te rna t iona l rank ings (WBI, TI) register these 
gains, a l though U k r a i n e s t i l l s ranks l o w o n governance f o r i t s l e v e l o f income . T h e 
q u a l i t y o f p u b l i c f inanc ia l management has imp roved . Progress towards the in tended 
ob jec t ive o f m o v i n g U k r a i n i a n p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions t o European standards, however, has 
been s low . Even though U k r a i n e ranks above the mean within the CIS commun i ty , i t 
fa l ls b e h i n d countries w i th similar incomes elsewhere in the w o r l d . 

31 The r a p i d increase in salaries was supported by a h i g h rate o f increase in labor p roduc t iv i ty . S t i l l , 
competitiveness as measured by unit labor costs in fo re ign currency has decreased.

GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGIC GOALS AND CAS DESIGN 

12. Th e 2003 -2007 CAS supported the government p rog ram titled “European 
Cho i c e ” - - a commitment to European-like institutions in Uk ra ine . T h e B a n k discussed 

the content o f the CAS w i th the government, the Pa r l iamen t and w i th c i v i l society. In 
addition, the C A S design took account o f the lessons de r ived f r o m the p rev ious CAS .38 
T h e 2003-2007 C A S organized expected results a round the seven p i l l a r s o f the 
government p rog ram in order t o acknowledge owne rsh ip and fac i l i ta te the p o l i c y

13. The re was continuity between the FY 0 0 -FY 0 3 CAS and the FY 0 4 -FY 0 7 CAS. M o s t

14. 
Th e government that came in following the events known as the “Orange

T h i s said, however, upg rad ing the q u a l i t y o f education remains a p r i o r i t y t o equip the

i n s i g h t s . Inves tmen t p ro jec ts supported the fight against TB and A ID S , educa t ion re fo rm 
and imp rovemen ts in water supply. 
Th e contribution of 
the B an k to arrest the TB and A IDS epidemic has been 
modest. The C A S p r i o r i t y set o n suppo r t ing the government’s e f fo r ts t o con ta in and treat

B an k performance in lending over the CAS period was satisfactory as a whole, 
although tainted by persistent problems in implementing the investment lending 
portfolio. During C A S p e r i o d the Bank approved 8 operations, o f w h i c h t w o we re

Policy-based (adjustment) lending has played the leading role in producing 
results62. As the r e v i ew o f effectiveness o f Bank assistance unde r each o f the i n d i v i d u a l 
p i l l a r s shows, the p o l i c y r e f o rm agenda, supported by the adjustment operations, 
de l ive red the m a i n results expected and achieved unde r the CAS.63 K e y achievements 
that adjustment supported inc luded : (a) f inanc ia l d isc ip l ine in the p u b l i c and p r iva te 
sectors; (b) r em o v i n g systemic threats t o the f inanc ia l sector; (c) se t t ing the basis f o r

trade and finance; (d) keep ing a prudent f isca l pos i t ion ; (e) imp rovemen ts in p rope r ty 
r i g h t s ; ( f ) p a r t i a l de - regu la t ion o f the economy t o encourage en t ry and m o v i n g ou t o f the 
shadow economy; and (g) im p r o v i n g the f inanc ia l and techn ica l performance o f the

t o the demand s t imu lus f r o m abroad and - as p r o d u c t i v i t y and wages recovered - t o the 
domestic demand pull. 
79. 
Various factors explain the relative effectiveness of adjustment lending: 
F i rs t , adjustment operations have he lped U k r a i n e s igna l t o in te rna t iona l ma rke ts 
i t s comm i tmen t t o and progress in m o v i n g t o a ma rke t economy. Th is signaled

0 Second, the adjustment p rog ram he lped the authorities coordinate imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the p o l i c y agenda among d i f fe ren t agencies. In this area, ana ly t ica l w o r k was 
an impo r tan t support and comp lemen t t o the adjustment dialogue. T h e p o l i c y 
d ia logue he lped m a i n t a i n con t inu i ty across d i f fe ren t administrations. 
Third, a l though budge ta ry support i s n o t as impo r tan t in f inanc ing terms as i t was 
ea r ly on, the government continues t o appreciate tha t the B a n k p rov ides long - te rm 
funds at compe t i t ive p r ices and these he lped im p r o v e Uk ra ine ’s debt p r o f i l e . 
Thus, even Uk ra ine ’s mos t recent in te rna t iona l b o n d issue at the peak o f favo rab le 
eme rg ing ma rke t sentiment achieved o n l y a f ive -yea r ma tu r i ty . 
Nonetheless, the broad agenda supported by adjustment moved a t a pace slower 
than expected. Ad jus tmen t was conceived as an ins t rumen t t o tack le b r o a d systemic o r 
thema t ic constraints. T o a la rge extent i t m e t this challenge with success by b reak ing k e y 
constraints and h e l p i n g m o v e the economy ahead. T h e downs ide o f the approach was the 
tendency t o cover too m a n y areas as adjustment became the p redom inan t ins t rumen t o f 
p o l i c y d ia logue in areas where the B a n k was engaged. A rguab ly , the b r o a d canvas o f 
top ics covered unde r adjustment reduced the focus and m a y have reduced the Bank ’s 
e f f e c t i ~ e n e s s . ~ ~ In addition, the ins t i tu t ion -bu i ld ing agenda m o v e d at a s low pace, 
espec ia l ly when i t requ i red leg is la t ive approval. De lays in the leg is la t ive agenda l a r g e l y 
account f o r the fac t that instead o f the p lanned annual series, the gap be tween adjustment 
operations was around t w o years o n average. 
Rapid economic growth and increasing creditworthiness reduced the urgency of 
and commitment to broad-based reforms.65 T h e slower than anticipated progress did n o t 
p reven t U k r a i n e f r o m ach iev ing mos t o f the targeted C A S outcomes, suggesting that 
these re fo rms , while c r i t ica l t o sustain g r ow t h in the longe r term, we re n o t immed ia te 
roadb locks f o r economic g r ow t h and p o v e r t y reduction. T rans i t ion successes despite 
p a r t i a l r e f o rm e f fo r ts inc lude : 
T h e government was able t o manage increases in pensions within a so l id f isca l

As a result of 
the above mentioned difJiculties, the resultsproduced with the 
help of 
investment projects were modest There are several reasons f o r this: 
0 First, p ro jec ted results o f investment lending in the C A S r e l i e d h e a v i l y o n the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f seven k e y inves tmen t p ro jec ts that we re ready at the beg inn ing o f 
the C A S : 
the Soc ia l Investment Fund, the T B / A I D S C o n t r o l Project, the P r iva te 
Sector Deve lopmen t p ro jec t (PSD), the State T a x A dm i n i s t r a t i o n Mode rn iza t ion 

101 

APL-with 

project, the R u r a l L a n d Titling and Cadastre p ro jec t and the E -deve lopmen t project. 
O f these seven projects, the PSD p ro jec t was cancelled, w h i l e E-development, 
T B / A ID S , and the R u r a l Land Titling and Cadastre p ro jec t we re a l l p a r t i a l l y o r 
comp le te ly suspended f o r extended pe r iods o f t ime . T h e p ro jec ted C A S results did 
n o t foresee the we igh t o f imp lemen ta t ion p rob lems in these k e y operations. 
0 Second, m o s t o f these p ro jec ts sought a high degree o f ins t i tu t iona l change, w h i c h 
mean t that, by design, the p ro jec ts we re n o t expected t o p roduce results right away. 
F o r instance, the State T a x A dm i n i s t r a t i o n M o d e r n i z a t i o n p ro jec t was designed as an 
an i n i t i a l focus o n the des ign o f n ew processes and p i l o t s and full 
imp lemen ta t ion in la te r APL operations. 
0 Third, the rest o f the p o r t f o l i o ( f i v e inves tmen t operations already unde r 
imp lemen ta t ion as the C A S was approved) also su f fe red f r o m imp lemen ta t ion 
d i f f i c u l t i e s and several p ro jec ts we re restructured. This means that they m a y n o t mee t 
a l l o f the in tended development objectives. 
0 Fourth, the in tended s im p l i f i c a t i o n o f coun t ry in te rna l procedures f o r app rova l 
and imp lemen ta t ion o f p ro jec ts did n o t take place. N e w projects-as 
opposed t o 
repeater operations-continue 
t o 
take 
l o n g t o develop, approve and reach 
effectiveness. 
0 Fifth, in a highly f rac tu red p u b l i c administration, 
the l a c k o f p rope r cap i ta l 
budge t ing has mean t that inves tmen t p ro jec ts are o f ten seen as “owned” by the B a n k 
and n o t the government. 
Las t ly , p ro jec ts imp lemen ted by cen t ra l government agencies r a n i n t o severe 
imp lemen ta t ion d i f f icu l t ies due t o the comp l ica ted procedures o f the cen t ra l 
government. Projects experienced lesser imp lemen ta t ion p rob lems in autonomous 
spending u n i t s such as state-owned enterprises, especially in the energy sector.66 

87. 
Th e B an k was proactive in analyzing the causes of poor investment lending 
performance and developing recommendations for improvement. An in te rna l r e v i ew o f 

inves tmen t l e n d i n g (2005) proposed to: (a) t o restructure o r cancel non -pe r fo rm ing 
projects; (b) t o reduce the i n s t i t u t i o n building components o f inves tmen t projects; (c) t o 
m o v e t o a greater use coun t ry systems; (d) t o encourage the government t o simplify i t s 
procedures f o r the approval and imp lemen ta t ion o f operations, and ( f ) t o im p r o v e in te rna l 
coo rd ina t ion be tween B a n k teams. These recommendations are unde r imp lemen ta t ion . 
T h e Bank and the government have advanced in c lean ing up the p o r t f o l i o th rough 
cance l la t ion o r r e - p r ~ g r a m r n i n g . ~ ~ 
In addition, n ew operations have sharper ob jec t ives 

66 As resu l t o f t h e d i f f icu l t ies experienced in the imp lemen ta t ion o f investment operations (especially those 
in p lace at the beg inn ing o f the CAS), investment and adjustment operations were n o t as comp lemen tary as 
expected. The investment operations were supposed to he lp build the ins t i tu t ions in areas c r i t i c a l f o r the 
r e f o rm agenda-taxation, 
land t i t l ing , p r iva te sector development, pensions and soc ia l security, technology, 
environment, etc. Cancellations, delays and res truc tur ing meant delays in ach iev ing r e s u l t s that w o u l d have 
made the r e f o rm agenda mo re effective. 
The f o l l ow i n g pro jec ts were cancelled: PSD, A z o v -B l a c k Sea (GEF), while E-development closed at the 
end o f an extended p e r i o d o f suspension. L o a n amounts were reduced s ign i f ican t ly in the Kyiv D i s t r i c t 
Hea t ing and L a n d T i t l i n g and Cadastre projects, w h i l e two further pro jec ts were under pa r t ia l suspension 
f o r extended per iods (TB and H I V - A I D S and L a n d T i t l i n g and Cadastre).

and are less ins t i tu t iona l ly loaded, w h i c h shou ld make i t easier t o im p l em e n t them and t o

A dm i n i s t r a t i o n M o d e r n i z a t i o n Project, approved in FY06 , lead ing the way . Reduc ing the 
c om p l e x i t y o f the des ign and focus ing o n the ru les unde r w h i c h execu t ing agencies 
operate can h e l p im p r o v e the pe r fo rmance o f inves tmen t operations. 
88. 
These efforts have yielded some improvements in performance, but Uk ra ine s t i l l 
lags the region in disbursement performance. 
T h e r a t i o o f disbursements t o ne t 
comm i tmen ts has been increasing, a lbe i t s low ly , f r o m 8.4 percent in F Y 0 6 t o 1 1 percent 
in FY07 , w i th i n i t i a l ind ica t ions in F Y 0 8 that i t m a y increase fu r the r . 
I t remains, 
however, qu i te l o w by the standards o f the E C A Reg ion and the Bank. T h e m a i n impac t 
o f these delays i s less f inanc ia l than o n effectiveness o f the p rog ram . T h e n ew CPS 
establishes clear p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance targets as one o f the benchma rks m o d u l a t i n g the 
l e v e l o f l e n d i n g support and proposes t o accelerate p o r t f o l i o restructuring, simplify 
p ro jec t design, emphasize greater c l ien t ownership, and deepen the m o v e towa rds coun t ry 
systems in r e f l e c t i o n o f the lessons learned during the FY 0 3 - 0 7 C A S . 

IFC Lending 

89. 
I FC lending provided an important source of f inanc ing for the private sector, 
and early evaluations suggest positive development implications. During the C A S 
period, I F C inves ted $681 m i l l i o n o f i t s o w n funds in p r iva te sector companies in 
U k r a i n e and m o b i l i z e d $263 m i l l i o n in add i t iona l p r iva te sector f inanc ing towa rd a to ta l

greenfield, mode rn iza t ion , and expansion projects by IFC ’ s p r iva te sector clients in 
agribusiness, p ow e r d is t r ibu t ion , cons t ruc t ion materials, re ta i l , logistics, ho te l , and steel 
sectors w o r t h $2.4 b i l l i o n . T h e p o r t f o l i o i s ve ry s t rong with n o non -pe r fo rm ing loans. 
A l t h o u g h the m a j o r i t y o f the p ro jec ts unde r th is C A S have n o t reached ope ra t ing m a t u r i t y

Results Framework 
96 . 
Th e focus on results benefited both the design and implementation of the CAS. 
T h e FY 0 3 -FY 0 7 C A S he lped p i l o t the results-based approach t o CAS s in the Bank . With 
h inds igh t , the r o a d m a p presented in the results m a t r i x was a use fu l gu ide f o r the p o l i c y 
dialogue and adjustment. T h e l inkage with inves tmen t operations was weaker. Fu tu re 
designs m a y b e n e f i t f r o m a stronger 
l inkage be tween po l icy -based lend ing and 
inves tmen t operations. 
97. 
The design of 
the indicators was satisfactory. 
T h e d r a f t i n g o f the expected 
development outcomes unde r the C A S was precise and m o s t ind ica to rs we re 
benchmarked. T h e CPR t o o k stock o f the p a t h t o results by m id - te rm . T h e advent o f a 
n ew government ra ised expectations that the pace o f imp lemen ta t ion w o u l d p i c k up and 
therefore the CPR did n o t adjust the results ma t r ix . With hindsight, perhaps this shou ld 
have been done. In some cases, the proposed ind ica to rs we re n o t deve loped (governance, 
technology, lega l a l ignmen t with Europe, etc.) making i t d i f f i c u l t t o t rack impac t . T h e 
n e x t strategy shou ld p a y greater a t ten t ion t o the measurement and t r a c k i n g o f results. A 
m o r e direct d ia logue o n the t rack ing o f results with government i s also advisable. 

Field Presence 

98. 
T h e increased presence o f the B a n k in U k r a i n e has made i t poss ib le t o p r o v i d e 
t im e l y assistance t o the government. T h i s presence also pe rm i ts t o m a i n t a i n a continuous 
p o l i c y d ia logue and make progress in the development and imp lemen ta t ion o f sector 
agendas, as has been the case in the energy sector. Howeve r , coun t ry presence i s a 
necessary but n o t a su f f ic ien t cond i t ion f o r effectiveness, as experience in other sectors 
shows.

Political developments affected

the reform agenda the CAS 

supported. T h e C A S was imp lemen ted during the tenure o f fou r d i f fe ren t governments, 
and inc luded pe r iods o f substantial p o l i t i c a l change, i n c l u d i n g the events that became 
k n o w n as the “Orange Revo lu t ion ” . A rguab ly , p o l i t i c a l unce r ta in ty d ive r ted a t ten t ion 
f rom re fo rm . Mo reove r , the m o v e t o European ins t i tu t ions i s n o t as p ow e r f u l an 
incen t ive in U k r a i n e as in Cen t ra l Eu rope whe re there was a concrete accession 
perspective. Deepen ing in teg ra t ion w i th the European U n i o n continues t o attract b road 
na t iona l support, i n c l u d i n g across the p o l i t i c a l spectrum, a lbe i t m o r e recen t ly with a 
greater sense o f rea l ism and a sense that societal and ins t i tu t iona l change in Uk ra ine w i l l 
take time. 

100. Progress was made in areas where political consensus existed or was forged. 

Ac ross the p o l i t i c a l spectrum, there i s consensus o n issues such as f isca l discipline, 
emphasis o n soc ia l expenditures, accession t o WTO, and energy secu r i ty and e f f ic iency . 
Shared p r io r i t ies he lped achieve results. The opposite has been the case in areas o f 
discrepancy-for 
instance, 
in p r iva t iza t ion , pens ion and social assistance re fo rm , 
corporate governance, etc. In areas o f high consensus, the B a n k can p l a y a p roduc t ive 
r o l e in p r o v i d i n g know ledge and techn ica l assistance as w e l l as resources. In areas o f 
l i m i t e d consensus, the WBG can p l a y an advocacy r o l e supported by good ana ly t ica l 
w o r k . 

101. Ove ra l l the quality of governance has improved i n the country, but s t i l l remains 
a major development challenge. 

Ind ica to rs such as the W o r l d B a n k Deve lopmen t 
Ins t i tu te Governance Ind ica to rs t rack m a j o r progress in government effectiveness, the 
q u a l i t y o f regu la t ion and the con t ro l o f co r rup t ion . T h e in tended B a n k support t o scale 
up engagement with c i v i l society did n o t deve lo as expected. On the other hand, the 
s i tua t ion in 2006 i s s t r i k i n g l y d i f fe ren t f r o m 1998.89 T h e p o l i t i c a l events o f 2004 b rough t 
about imp rovemen ts in vo ice and accountability-with 
greater transparency ( f reedom o f 
the media, econom ic po l icy , and government in fo rma t ion ) . Thus, i t i s in the area o f c i v i l 
engagement whe re the greater progress in the coun t ry was made, even i f the agenda the 
B a n k in tended t o imp lemen t did n o t h l l y take o f f . 

102. Still, there is the perception that governance issues represent a major constraint 

in critical sectors-effectiveness 
in the use o f p u b l i c resources, the env i ronmen t f o r 
business, corporate governance, and co r rup t ion . 
In summary, w h i l e U k r a i n e ranks 
r e l a t i v e l y w e l l in the con tex t o f C IS countries, i t lags peer countries in Cen t ra l Eu rope 
and at similar leve ls o f income .

By contrast, U k r a i n e ranks lowest-despite 
improvements-in

LESSONS 

103. 

Institutionally capable and committed national agencies increase the likelihood 
implementation effectiveness. T h e Cen t ra l Bank, the M o F and the energy comp lex 

of 
are capable, comm i t ted agencies that get things done. In such cases, a l though i t m a y take 
t im e t o reach agreement, prospects f o r successful imp lemen ta t ion are high. Weak 
ins t i tu t ions are less l i k e l y t o imp lemen t agreements even i f there i s a high l e v e l o f f o rm a l 
“ownership.” This p a r t l y exp la ins the d i f f i c u l t i e s with advanc ing progress o n soc ia l 
issues and in the environment. Unde rs tand ing the capacity o f coun t ry authorities he lps t o 
rea l is t ica l ly assess the l i k e l i h o o d o f imp lemen ta t ion . Howeve r , the capacity 
t o 
imp lemen t i s n o t f i x e d and can increase th rough strong p o l i t i c a l mandates, good 
leadership and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm . I t can also deteriorate. 

104. Linkages across themes reinforce the effectiveness of 

interventions. This 

r e v i ew has shown h o w a k e e n unde rs tand ing o f the l inkages across themes can h e l p 
advance r e f o rm and p roduce results. 
Im p r o v i n g payments and f isca l d isc ip l ine has 
he lped make further progress in the f inanc ia l and the energy sectors. In addition, the 
focus o n l inkages be tween energy and the env i ronmen t (K y o t o and “green energy”) has 
already p roduced pos i t ive results. By contrast, the l inkage be tween f isca l p r o g r amm i n g 
and expenditure (“social sectors”) remains highly undeveloped. L ikew ise , the l inkages 
be tween de l ive ry o f social services and f isca l approaches t o decentralization, despite 
some attempts, rema in i n s u f f i c i e n t l y articulated. 

105. Effectiveness requires not only a clear vision, including expected results, but an 
understanding of the remedies to remove the barriers to achieve them. This r e v i ew has 

s h ow n that clear objectives are n o t enough t o achieve results. T h e comp l ica ted and o f ten 
non-transparent p o l i t i c a l economy o f U k r a i n e stalled progress in several areas. These 
i n c l u d e l e n d i n g t o mun ic ipa l i t ies , pens ion re fo rm , governance o f p u b l i c and p r iva te 
enterprises, p r iva t iza t ion , c rea t ion o f a u n i f i e d p rope r ty registry, soc ia l assistance re fo rm , 
service de l ive ry , etc. In mos t o f these areas, those w h o h o l d fo rma l mandates o f ten d o 
n o t have the p o l i t i c a l mandate. This i s n o t su rp r is ing in countries o f the fo rme r Sov ie t 
U n i o n where by design there was a d ivo rce be tween p o l i c y dec is ion making and 
execution. T h e tendency t o concentrate p o l i c y dec is ion -mak ing at the t o p w i l l con t inue 
in the absence o f a deeper r e f o rm o f the state. 

106. A broad agenda risks wide variability of results. The 2003 CAS agenda was 

b r o a d because i t endeavored t o cover m o s t aspects o f the government p rog ram . T h e p r i c e 
has been a w i d e v a r i a b i l i t y o f results. I t was simply n o t poss ib le t o dea l with a l l o f the 
issues thoroughly, w i th l i m i t e d coun t ry and B a n k resources. With hindsight, greater 
se lec t iv i ty w o u l d have he lped im p r o v e the qua l i ty o f the ove ra l l de l ive ry . Se lec t iv i ty 
requires putting in p lace ru les o f engagement and disengagement and en fo rc ing them. 
F l e x i b i l i t y he lps m o v e in areas o f oppo r tun i ty and d rop s low -mov ing agendas. 

107. Achieving results demands sustained efforts 

that combine the use of various 

instruments. A l t h o u g h there m a y be cases o f q u i c k wins, in m o s t circumstances, 
progress came about th rough a comb ina t ion o f in tens ive dialogue supported by ana ly t ica l 
w o r k and adjustment, and, in a few cases, investment. M a r g i n a l o r exp lo ra to ry e f fo r ts

108. The B an k should adopt greater selectivity in i ts strategy approach, targeting a 
limited set of 
thematic areas tha t exploit synergies and at the same time provide for 
greaterfocus. T h e strategy f o r F Y 0 8 t o FY 1 1 shou ld focus o n k e y themes that cut across 
the boa rd and a v o i d na r row sector approaches. I t shou ld also b e selective in the themes 
f o r full engagement. T a k i n g a long - te rm perspective he lps achieve se lec t iv i ty by 
pos tpon ing in te rven t ions that are n o t ready. A selective and p r i o r i t i z e d agenda helps 
focus Bank and coun t ry resources o n ach iev ing substantive resu l ts rather dispersed 
inc remen ta l gains. Se lec t iv i ty , however, i s a challenge because the pace o f progress has

109. 
A l low for flexibility in program design. 
T h e B a n k shou ld f o l l o w a f l e x i b l e

70 Lagg ing areas that need a t ten t ion are: (a) p r iva te and pub l ic corporate governance; (b) regu la tory 
compliance costs f o r business; (c) public expenditure management-ntry 
p o i n t to: f isca l space f o r 
investment, soc ia l sector re form ; and decentralization; (d) social sector re form , and (e) r e f o rm o f the state. 
Poor corporate governance w i l l s l ow d ow n f inanc ia l sector deepening, economic d ivers i f ica t ion , and the 
competitiveness o f the economy. A lagg ing sma l l and medium enterprise sector reduces the dynam ism o f 
the economy. L a c k o f a t ten t ion t o budge tary issues and the need f o r increased effectiveness o f p u b l i c

1 10. Evaluate the likelihood of 

implementation before undertaking significant 

commitments. C l a r i t y o f objectives, d i rec t eva lua t ion o f owne rsh ip and techn ica l 
capac i ty o f imp lemen t ing authorities, and a sense o f the p o l i t i c a l economy b e h i n d a

building; in other cases, the B a n k can p l a y a pos i t ive r o l e by tilting the balance o f 
p o l i t i c a l interests towa rds re fo rm . 

1 1 1. M a k e investment interventions wo r k W i t h o u t func t ion ing inves tmen t projects, 

the scope f o r de l ive r ing results narrows. T h e recommendations o f the 2005 r e v i ew o f

(e.g., energy companies) m a y favo r imp lemen ta t ion success, but such an approach leaves 
open the question o f h o w t o assist with building ins t i tu t ions at the cen t ra l levels. 
In

Management Response 

Strategy. The Bank strategy shou ld s tr ive f o r greater 
selectivity, focus ing o n p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management, PSD, energy, and soc ia l protection, 
and within these areas, o n im p r o v i n g governance and

ESW. The B a n k shou ld b e p lac ing greater emphasis 
than in the past o n p r i v a t e sector development and 
infrastructure. 

Investment lend ing . A t igh ter a l ignmen t i s needed 
between investment pro jec ts and the government

In the imp lemen ta t ion o f this f ramewo rk , the d ive rs i ty o f compa ra t ive

Based on the ru les fo r selectivity presented above, a 
typo logy of 
p rog ramma t ic intervent ions was deve loped depend ing u p o n wh ich c r i t e r i a they 

fulfill (F igu re A.4.1). At the in te rsec t ion o f the three perspectives o f c l ien t demand, 
u rgency o f need and Bank capac i ty t o lead are the “core programs”. At the in te rsec t ion 
o f c l ien t demand and u rgency o f need, but where a r e f o rm p a t h (or the Bank ’s capac i ty t o 
lead) remains t o b e fully developed, are the “development programs”. At the in te rsec t ion 
o f u rgency o f need and B a n k capacity, whe re c l ien t demand i s l i m i t e d are the “advocacy 
programs3771.

o n who in the Government one talks to. W h a t matters f o r se lec t iv i ty i s that there i s clear and expressed

The pub l ic has to understand reforms to m a k e them successful. The WB should

support t o reforms. 
The Bank should educate the media h ow to cover different aspects o f reforms 
(e.g., in energy and infrastructure). 
Within the new CPS cycle the WB should envisage broader dissemination o f 
more comprehensible in fo rma t ion about i t s projects, programs and development 
issues as a whole. 
Advocacy programs under the new CPS wou ld be a c r i t ica l t o o l to mob i l ize support o f
