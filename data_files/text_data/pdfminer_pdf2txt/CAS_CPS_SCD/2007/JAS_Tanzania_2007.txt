EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Context. Th rough in -dep th consultations, the Government o f Tanzania f ina l ized in June 2005 i t s 
second pove r ty reduc t ion strategy ca l led the “Na t iona l Strategy f o r G r ow t h and Reduc t ion o f 
Poverty”, o r MKUKUTA, cove r ing 2005-2010. The strategy iden t i f ies three clusters o f b road 
outcomes: g r ow t h o f the economy and reduc t ion o f income pove r ty ; imp rovemen t o f qua l i ty o f 
l i f e and social well-being; and governance and accountability. The M K U K U T A aspires t o a high 
degree o f cluster and cross-sectoral coherence across a very b road p o l i c y range. Government has 
embarked o n an ambitious p rog ram fo r MKUKTA implementation, a t temp t ing a comprehensive 
and innova t ive approach o n linking MKUKUTA t o planning, budget and m o n i t o r i n g systems. 

Wor ld Bank Group Program . Over the past several years, the W o r l d B a n k G roup has been 
ac t ive ly engaged across a wide range o f sectors and thematic areas in Tanzania. Given this l e v e l 
o f engagement, s ign i f ican t lessons have been lea rned w h i c h o f f e r a so l id p l a t f o rm f o r the WBG’s 
strategic approach in Tanzania during the FY07-10 period, inc lud ing : 1) a focus o n results i s 
c r i t ica l t o ach iev ing the desired outcomes and usua l ly requires a multi-sectoral approach; 2) 
partnerships, i n c l u d i n g ha rmon ized a id moda l i t ies and an increasing m o v e to budget support, are 
impo r tan t f o r making the bes t use o f resources and comparative advantages, reduc ing transaction 
costs f o r government, and building the capacity t o de l ive r results, and 3) analytics and advice 
(AAA) are key t o p r o v i d i n g a so l id founda t ion f o r informed p o l i c y decisions and investments. 

WBG’s engagement i s based on: (i) Government expectations; (ii) IDA’S b road mandate and 
techn ica l capacity within the coun t ry o f f i c e w h i c h enables active IDA pa r t ic ipa t ion in 
government-led w o r k i n g groups at b o t h the p rog ram and sector leve ls , and facilitates access t o 
the WBG’s g loba l reach and technical depth; and (iii) the re la t ive mandates and capacity o f other 
DPs. By ma in ta in ing a b road engagement across sectors, the WBG i s well p laced t o support 
Government as i t imp lemen ts one o f the largest and mos t comp lex programs in A f r ica , 
expe r imen t ing with n ew approaches o n resu l ts , a l ignmen t and ha rmon iza t ion untested elsewhere. 

In support o f M U K U T A Cluster I: Growth of the Economy and Reduction of Income Poverty, 
the WBG w i l l s t r ive t o fu r the r imp rove prospects f o r growth, especially imp rovemen t o f the 
investment climate, th rough better in fo rmed choices and better financed programs in agriculture, 
forestry, environment, and mining; reduced in f ras t ruc tu re bottlenecks, no tab ly in transport and 
energy; a stronger focus o n improving labou r force skills; deepening re fo rms in the f inanc ia l 
sector and enab l ing environment f o r p r iva te sector activities; and increased reg iona l integration. 
In M K U K U T A Cluster 11: Improvement of Quality of L i fe and Social Well-being, the WBG’s 
strategic focus w i l l be to strengthen hea l th f inanc ing and human resources, and technical, te r t ia ry 
and secondary education, imp rove capacity at l o c a l government l e v e l t o de l ive r services, together 
with improved m o n i t o r i n g and reporting; and support social p ro tec t ion with a focus o n analysis 
and advice o n h o w t o better manage soc ia l risk and reach the vulnerable members o f the 
commun i ty . In M K U K U T A Cluster 111: Governance and Accountability, the WBG strategy w i l l 
he lp imp rove governance at national, d is t r ic t and village leve ls , th rough b o t h supply- and 
demand-side assistance; and p romo te greater use o f coun t ry systems, and mo re e f fec t ive u s e and 
strengthening o f domestic capacity and accountability, n o t a b l y in key governance institutions, 
e.g. accounting, auditing, f inanc ia l management, procurement, and social safeguards.

The Bank i s a l ign ing behind Government’s programs and strategies, increasingly using 
harmonized aid modalities, such as development po l icy lending, basket funds, and j o i n t 
analytical and advisory services, and re ly ing more and more on Government processes and 
systems. This approach reduces Government’s transaction costs and increases aid effectiveness 
by strengthening Government’s systems, 
including sector 
rev iew processes, 
financial 
management, accounting, auditing, procurement and M&E. In addition, i t encourages greater 
attention to cross-sector linkages. Ensuring strong W B G expertise in-country fo r key sector and 
cross sector wo rk 
i s c r i t ica l t o sustaining the po l icy dialogue, supporting program 
implementation, and contributing to improved outcomes. 

The Joint Assistance Strategy f o r Tanzania (JAST) comprises four parts, which collectively 
w i l l serve as the World Bank Group CAS for FY07 to FY10: 

Part I i s the national medium-term framework established by Government fo r managing 
development co-operation with i t s Development Partners (DPs) so as 
to improve the 
collaboration in achieving national development and poverty reduction goals. In discussion o f 
the draft JAST, Government and DPs agreed on the need fo r further j o i n t wo rk on parts 11-IV 
below, engaging the en t i re D P community and focusing on the Government’s own planning 
process, the MTEF in particular. The appropriate balance o f roles between Government and DPs 
in the JAST and wider planning process has been a fruitful area o f dialogue, under continuing 
review through the Government-led JAST Wo rk ing Group. 

Part I 1 and Part I11 are the Joint Program Document (JPD) developed in consultation w i t h 
Government by the Development Partners Group (DPG) as a response t o Tanzania poverty 
reduction strategies (MKUKUTA fo r mainland Tanzania; MKUZA fo r Zanzibar) and the JAST. 
Part I1 i s a j o i n t country analysis describing Tanzania’s development achievements and 
challenges. Part I11 i s the j o i n t program part, reflecting DPG planned support and aid 
effectiveness commitments to Tanzania over the 4 remaining years o f MKUKUTA, FY07-10. 

Part IVs are agency specific supplements, bu i ld ing f rom the analysis, commitments and 
undertakings in parts I, I1 and 111. The Wo r ld Bank Group (WBG) Part I V describes the WBG’s 
strategic approach and proposed program over support over the FY07- 10 pe r iod (advice, analytic 
wo rk and financing, bo th ongoing and planned). Based on the Resu l ts M a t r i x fo r a l l DPs in Part 
111, Part I V also includes a W B G spec i f ic resu l ts matrix with milestones that facilitate monitoring 
o f progress during the FY07-10 period.

1. What i s the JAST? 

The Jo in t Assistance Strategy f o r Tanzania (JAST), in Kiswahili ‘M k a k a t i w a Pamo ja w a 
M isaada Tanzania’ (MPAMITA), i s a na t iona l medium-term f ramewo rk f o r manag ing 
development co -ope ra t ion be tween the Gove rnmen t o f the U n i t e d Repub l ic o f Tanzania 
(Government) and Deve lopmen t Partners so as t o achieve na t iona l development and 
pove r ty reduc t ion goals. I t howeve r also ou t l ines the r o l e o f non-state actors t o the extent 
that they con t r ibu te t o the successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the Strategy. 

The JAST has been fo rmu la ted in the spirit o f na t iona l and in te rna t iona l comm i tmen ts 
and in i t ia t ives o n a i d effectiveness - mos t no tab ly the Tanzania Assistance Strategy 
(2002), the M o n t e r r e y Consensus o n F inanc ing f o r Deve lopmen t (2002)’ the R om e 
Dec la ra t ion o n Aid Ha rmon isa t ion (2003)’ the Ma r rakech Memo randum o n M a n a g i n g f o r 
Results (2004) and the Paris Dec la ra t ion o n Aid Effectiveness (2005). I t spans a 
renewable cyc le o f five years and outlines the m a i n objectives, p r inc ip les and b road 
arrangements o f Tanzania’s development partnership. I t i s complemented by an A c t i o n 
P l a n that specifies concrete ac t iv i t ies and t ime f rames f o r imp lemen t ing J A S T and a 
m o n i t o r i n g f ramewo rk with ind ica to rs t o measure Gove rnmen t and Deve lopmen t Partner 
performance. 

The J A S T w i l l be implemented at a l l leve ls o f the Gove rnmen t within the existing 
national, sector and l o c a l processes f o r a l l a i d re la t ions with Deve lopmen t Partners. 
Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l adopt the Strategy as a basis f o r guiding the management o f 
the i r development co-operation with the Government. B i la te ra l agreements and coun t ry 
assistance strategies w i l l be b rough t in l i n e with the JAST and w i l l spec i fy concrete 
arrangements in imp lemen t ing the J A S T f o r i n d i v i d u a l Partners. A l l partners recognise 
that imp lemen t ing J A S T i s a gradual process o f m o v i n g towa rds higher leve ls o f

2. Background to the development o f JAST 

Tanzania has been c a r r y i n g ou t a i d management re fo rms as pa r t o f the broader economic 
re fo rms undertaken since the mid 1990s. They have been part o f i t s e f fo r ts t o make a i d 
m o r e e f fec t ive f o r ach iev ing development and p o v e r t y reduc t ion and suppo r t ive o f 
coun t ry systems, structures and processes. In January 1997, the Gove rnmen t and i t s 
Deve lopmen t Partners j o i n t l y adopted the recommendations o f the Repo r t o f the G roup o f 
Independent Advisors, l e d by Professor Gerard K. He l le ine r , w h o we re comm iss ioned in 
1994 t o evaluate and come up with proposals o n h o w t o im p r o v e development co- 
operation in Tanzania. The G roup among others had recommended that the Government 
formulates clear med ium - t o long - te rm na t iona l development p r io r i t ies and undertakes 
necessary re fo rms in p u b l i c service and f inanc ia l management. Deve lopmen t Partners had 
been urged to take actions t o better coordinate and ha rmon ise the i r development 
assistance i n c l u d i n g practices and procedures as we l l as t o increase the p red ic tab i l i ty o f 
a id f lows . 
The adop t ion o f the Repo r t ’s recommendations in the ‘Ag reed No tes ’ - an agreement 
between the Gove rnmen t and i t s Deve lopmen t Partners o n 18 actions t o b e taken t o 
im p r o v e the i r re la t ionsh ip - se t in m o t i o n a process o f redefining the re la t ionsh ip between 
the Gove rnmen t and i t s Deve lopmen t Partners and the management o f a i d o n the basis o f 
p r inc ip les o f na t iona l ownership, government leadership, ha rmon isa t ion and alignment. 
This process o f enhancing partnership relations and a i d effectiveness was supported by 
further independent assessments o f Tanzania’s development partnership, undertaken by 
Professor He l le ine r in 1997, 1999 and 2000 and f o l l ow e d by an ins t i tu t iona l ised 
Independent M o n i t o r i n g G roup (IMG) since 2002. 

One m a j o r outcome o f the process was the establishment o f the Tanzania Ass is tance . 
Strategy (TAS), w h i c h was launched in 2002. F r o m 2002/03 until 2004/05, the TAS 
served as the med ium - te rm f ramewo rk 
f o r development co-operation, a im i n g at 
strengthening a i d coordination, ha rmon isa t ion and a l ignmen t as w e l l as na t iona l 
ownership and Gove rnmen t leadership o f the development process. A TAS A c t i o n Plan, 
developed during FY 2002/03, se t ou t p rac t ica l steps f o r im p l em e n t i n g T A S . Ac t ions 
were g rouped in fou r p r i o r i t y areas, name ly (1) inc reas ing the p red ic tab i l i ty o f a i d flows, 
(2) in teg ra t ing external resources i n t o the Government budget and Exchequer system, (3) 
ha rmon is ing and ra t iona l is ing processes, and (4) im p r o v i n g na t iona l capacities f o r a i d 
coo rd ina t ion and ex te rna l resource management. 

The imp lemen ta t ion o f the T A S has con t r ibu ted t o considerable progress in the above 
men t ioned areas. The Gove rnmen t has strengthened p u b l i c f inanc ia l management and 
accountability. P red ic tab i l i ty o f external resources has im p r o v e d and ex te rna l funds have

5.3.2. Deve lopmen t Partner support 

Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l support the Government e f fo r ts t o develop sustainable 
capacity in the p u b l i c sector and across society. They w i l l do so by respond ing to na t iona l 
capacity needs with f inanc ia l and techn ica l assistance t o the Gove rnmen t and t o non-state 
actors. They recognise that capacity development i s a long - te rm e f f o r t and w i l l design the 
timing and scope o f their support so that i t i s consistent with the country’s capacity t o

Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l also con t r ibu te to capacity strengthening by inc reas ing ly

these are able t o meet VFM and capacity development requirements. T h e Gove rnmen t 
and Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l undertake measures t o strengthen na t iona l TA in these 
respects. 

TA personnel w i l l primarily be used f o r capac i ty development rather than f o r p ro jec t o r

In order t o achieve a m o r e even engagement o f Deve lopmen t Partners in sectors and

Partners, Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l ra t iona l ise the numbe r o f sectors o r cross- 
cu t t inghhema t ic areas that they engage in. At the same time, the numbe r o f Deve lopmen t 
Partners that are ‘active’ in a sector o r thematic area w i l l b e l i m i t e d t o an appropriate 
level, depending o n the needs and capac i ty o f the sector/thematic area. Deve lopmen t 
Partners outside a pa r t icu la r sector/thematic area w i l l b e represented by those Partners 
that are ‘active’ in the area o f concern and w i l l assume the r o l e o f ‘delegating partners’. 
T h e y can nevertheless p r o v i d e assistance t o any sectorhhematic area within a f ramewo rk 
o f delegated co-operation, as d i v i s i o n o f labou r does n o t concern the amount o r 
d is t r ibu t ion o f Deve lopmen t Partner support. 

At a second l e v e l o f d i v i s i o n o f labour, ‘lead partners’ w i l l be appointed in each sector, 
thematic area and, where necessary, sub-sector t o lead and coordinate other Partners that 
are ac t ive in that area in a l l matters. Depend ing o n the case, the r o l e o f ‘lead partner’ m a y 
b e ro ta ted among d i f fe ren t Partners that engage in a pa r t icu la r sector/thematic area. In 
addition, respons ib i l i ty can b e delegated t o d i f fe ren t Partners f o r adm in is te r ing o r 
ca r ry ing ou t specific ac t iv i t ies (e.g. ana ly t ic wo rk , m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation) o r guiding 
specific aspects o f dialogue within the area o f concern. 

‘A c t i v e ’ Deve lopmen t Partners in a sector/thematic area w i l l represent others in 
sector/thematic dialogue with the Government, whereby ‘lead partners’ w i l l act as foca l 
p o i n t in commun ica t ion with the Government. T h e y w i l l t im e l y share a l l re levan t

themselves and present consolidated views t o the Government, but also repo r t ex is t ing 
d ive rgen t op in ions where consensus cannot b e attained. 

Within and across sectors and thematic areas, Deve lopmen t Partners hannon ise the i r 
activities, funding decisions, requirements, ana ly t ic wo rk , meetings, missions, rev iews 
and other processes and a l i g n them to Government strategies, systems and processes. A s

capacity. 

Other selection c r i te r ia t o b e taken i n t o account f o r Deve lopmen t Partners’ engagement in 
sectors o r thematic areas are: 
Deve lopmen t Partner organisational capacity; 
The appropriate t o t a l number o f Deve lopmen t Partners in a sector o r thematic 
area, taking i n t o account the size, nature, needs in l i n e with Gove rnmen t policies, 
and capac i ty o f the sector o r thematic area o f concern; 
Established re la t ionsh ips with Government, o the r Deve lopmen t Partners and non - 
state actors; 
Deve lopmen t Partners’ willingness t o cooperate with each other in a pa r t icu la r 
sector o r thematic area; 
Deve lopmen t Partner headquarter mandate; 
The extent o f decentralised au tho r i ty enab l ing f i e l d o f f ices t o make decisions; and 
W i l l ingness t o sustain support and inves t in the agency’s competencies in the 
long - term. 

With regards t o taking o n a lead ing role, factors t o consider in add i t ion t o the above are: 
Deve lopmen t Partner organisational capacity t o assume leadership; 
Other Deve lopmen t Partners’ w i l l ingness t o recognise and t rus t a Deve lopmen t 
Partner as leader; and 
The d is t r ibu t ion o f lead respons ib i l i t ies among Deve lopmen t Partners so as t o 
fac i l i ta te equitable sharing o f wo rk . 

In each sector/thematic area, relevant M D A s in consu l ta t ion with L G A s and in agreement 
with Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l decide w h i c h Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l ac t ive ly engage 
in the area and w h o w i l l assume the r o l e o f lead Partner. In this context, the Government 
and Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l consider the su i tab i l i ty o f ex is t ing d i v i s i o n o f labou r

7. Financing instruments and arrangements 

7.1. Modalities for delivering development assistance to the Government 

At the heart o f the na t iona l development process in Tanzania are the na t iona l budget and 
the MKUKUTN MKUZA processes, with the na t iona l budget being the primary means 
f o r reach ing MKUKUTN MKUZA objectives. The m a j o r l i n k s , w h i c h i n f o r m the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the MKUKUTN MKUZA and the comm i tmen ts made in the na t iona l 
budget, are the annual P u b l i c Expend i tu re R e v i ew (PER) and the Medium-Term 
Expend i tu re F ramewo rk (MTEF), w h i c h translates the MKUKUTN MKUZA i n t o 
f i n d a b l e and imp lemen tab le ac t iv i t ies . The ou tpu t o f these processes i n f o rm s a l l 
stakeholders i n c l u d i n g Deve lopmen t Partners o f the progress achieved and therefore 
resource comm i tmen ts f o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategies. Full in teg ra t ion o f 
external resources i n t o the Gove rnmen t budget and Exchequer system i s therefore c ruc ia l 
f o r ach iev ing e f fec t ive planning, imp lemen ta t ion and m o n i t o r i n g o f the MKUKUTN 
MKUZA. 

The Government receives external resources unde r th ree moda l i t ies , n am e l y General 
Budget Support (GBS), basket finds, and direct p ro jec t finds. 

General Budget Support 

GBS i s the Government’s p re fe r red a i d moda l i ty . I t has been associated with greater 
ownership, harmonisation, alignment, manag ing f o r resu l ts , m u t u a l and domestic 
accountability. I t i s thus consistent with the TAS (2002), the M o n t e r r e y Consensus 
(2002), the Rome Dec la ra t ion (2003), the Ma r rakech Memo randum (2004) and the Pa r is 
Dec la ra t ion (2005) comm i tmen ts o n a i d effectiveness. Spec i f ica l ly , GBS has 
demonstrated the f o l l ow i n g advantages ove r other instruments:

I t i s consistent with the Government legal framework: 
.\/ The Cons t i tu t ion o f the U n i t e d Repub l ic o f Tanzania, Chapter 7 , A r t ic les 135 
and 136 o n the con t ro l o f the legislature o n p u b l i c finances, w h i c h state that 
a l l revenuedfinances de r ived f r o m various sources f o r the u s e o f the 
Government sha l l b e deposited in the Consolidated Fund and be appropriated 
by the Parliament. 
.\/ The P u b l i c Finance A c t No . 6, 2001, Part 11-Control and Management o f 
Pub l ic Finance, w h i c h states that the Parliament shou ld m a i n t a i n con t ro l ove r 
p u b l i c m o n e y and the Minister f o r Finance shou ld p r o v i d e fill and 
transparent accounts t o Parliament f o r the use o f resources and p u b l i c 
moneys. 

I t increases the p r o p o r t i o n o f external resources subjected t o the na t iona l budget 
process, thereby increasing national ownership o f the development process by 
emphasizing the na t iona l budget as the f ramewo rk f o r i d e n t i f y i n g p r i o r i t i e s and 
p rog ramm ing resource use. This a l lows f o r a more equitable distribution of

development funds within and across MDAs, Regions and LGAs, as a l l funding 
allocations are p lanned and decided in a s ing le process - the na t iona l budget. 
I t places the Gove rnmen t m o r e fully within the sc ru t iny o f the Pa r l iamen t and c i v i l 
society, as m o r e decisions have t o be taken within the f ramewo rk o f a transparent 
budge ta ry process. This in turn enhances domestic accountability. 
I t strengthens the Pa r l iamen ta ry r o l e f o r dec is ion making in resource a l loca t ion by 
i n c l u d i n g m o r e ex te rna l resources i n t o the na t iona l budge t app rova l process. I t thus 
contributes t o shifting Government accountability from Development Partners 
to citizens through the Parliament. 
I t strengthens the national budget process by limiting the access o f Government 
agencies t o ex t ra budgetary finance and by m a k i n g the na t iona l budge t the m a i n 
source o f resource allocation. As a resu l t , i t w i l l be g i v e n m o r e a t ten t ion by a l l 
stakeholders and w i l l thus be strengthened. 
I t p romo tes a coherent planning process, conso l ida t ing the resource envelope and 
diminishing t h e d is t inc t ion be tween recurrent and development finance as w e l l as 
assisting in reduc ing the gap between external resource f l ow s recorded in the 
budget and in the balance o f payments. 
I t strengthens national public financial management and accountability 
systems by p r o v i d i n g funds d i rec t ly t o the budge t t o be u t i l i z e d th rough 
Government’s o w n systems and by using na t iona l accoun t ing and aud i t procedures 
and systems. 
I t increases 
the predictability of external resource availability and 
disbursements by bas ing funding decisions o n outcomes o f a j o i n t r e v i ew o f 
performance based o n a c omm o n l y agreed Performance Assessment F ramewo rk , 
w h i c h t a k e s p lace p r i o r t o the f inanc ia l year in w h i c h disbursements are t o be made. 
T h i s in turn facilitates mo re strategic and rea l is t ic budget p lann ing as GBS funds 
are k n o w n in advance. 
I t directs the focus o f dialogue on national strategic issues o f p o l i c y and economic 
management, and in the process makes s ign i f ican t con t r ibu t ions t o the design o f 
p o l i c y . 
I t directs the focus o f technical assistance and capacity development on co re 
public policy and public expenditure management processes, thus con t r ibu t ing 
t o the process o f ins t i tu t iona l renewa l w h i c h the Gove rnmen t has undergone since

Basket funds 

Basket funds have p l a y e d a b ig r o l e in f inanc ing core p u b l i c r e f o rm programmes and 
development ac t iv i t ies at the sector leve l . During the imp lemen ta t ion process, the 
f o l l ow i n g shortcomings have howeve r b e e n experienced:

T h e y have created unnecessary pa ra l le l imp lemen ta t ion and management systems 
and structures as w e l l as f inanc ing mechanisms, thus add ing transaction costs t o the 
Government. 
They have l i m i t e d the degree o f Gove rnmen t owne rsh ip over resource a l loca t ion 
across and within sectors and re fo rms . 
L a c k o f complete and comparable i n f o rm a t i o n across sectors and re fo rms has 
created d i f f i c u l t i e s in reduc ing the dup l ica t ion o f ac t iv i t ies and m a x im i z i n g 
complementarities. 

Direct project funds 

D i r e c t p ro jec t funds have also been impo r tan t in f inanc ing development expenditures in 
the coun t ry . Howeve r , they have demonstrated the f o l l ow i n g disadvantages: 

T h e persistent high vo lume o f o f f -budge t p ro jec t f inanc ing arrangements has 
p r o v i d e d many Government agencies with con t inued access t o f inanc ing channels 
tha t la rge ly bypass and therefore undermine the na t iona l budget process. 
T h e dominance o f fo re ign p ro jec t f inanc ing w h i c h continues t o p redom inan t ly 
re f lec t the p r io r i t ies o f Deve lopmen t Partners has l im i t e d and undermined the 
d isc re t ion that i s available t o the Gove rnmen t t o allocate finds in accordance with 
na t iona l p r io r i t ies . T h i s in turns has p reven ted the Government f r o m taking fill and 
e f fec t ive owne rsh ip and leadership in manag ing the development process. 
Projects have o f ten lacked transparency and Deve lopmen t Partners suppo r t ing the 
p ro jec ts have been better i n f o rm e d about their imp lemen ta t ion than the Gove rnmen t 
and other domestic stakeholders. Hence, accoun tab i l i ty t o Deve lopmen t Partners 
has been given p r i o r i t y ove r domestic accoun tab i l i ty . 
P ro jec t finding has been m o r e unpredictable than other modalities, as i t depends o n 
imp lemen ta t ion progress that i s d i f f i c u l t t o bring in l i n e with the na t iona l budge t 
calendar. 
T h e setting up o f cos t ly P ro jec t Imp lemen ta t ion Units (PIUs) pa ra l le l t o 
Gove rnmen t systems and structures has undermined Government structures and 
systems and prevented p ro jec t sustainability. 

In respect o f the above ou t l ined advantages o f GBS and l im i ta t ions o f other moda l i t ies , 
Deve lopmen t Partners w i l l inc reas ing ly m o v e t o GBS f r o m other moda l i t ies and adhere 
t o c r i te r ia o f ‘good practice’ f o r using basket funds and direct p ro jec t funds. In the 
medium-term, basket funds w i l l b e limited t o those contexts where i t i s seen appropriate 
by the Government and s ign i f ican t transaction cost savings are possible, pa r t icu la r ly in 
protecting public reforms and/or thematic areas w h i c h a re n o t yet mainstreamed in 
n o rm a l Government activities. The already ex is t ing baske t funds that d o n o t meet these 
c r i te r ia w i l l therefore be u t i l ised as m u c h as possible as a transition measure to GBS. 
Direct project funds t o the Government w i l l b e u t i l ised f o r large-scale infrastructure

be tested be fo re be ing mainstreamed in the n o rm a l Government system and machinery, 
and f o r emergency aid where q u i c k and loca l ised service de l ive ry i s needed. T h e y w i l l

In add i t ion t o the above listed mu l t i -s takeho lde r consu l ta t ive fora, the Gove rnmen t w i l l

dialogue structure among their agencies, in pa r t icu la r within arrangements o f delegated 
co-operation. 

8.3. Sector d ia logue 

As the ove ra rch ing strategy f o r guiding the use o f external resources t o support the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the MKUKUTN MKUZA, the J A S T promotes the strengthening o f 
th rough e f fec t ive pa r t ic ipa t ion in d ia logue by a l l 
u n d e r l y i n g sector processes 
stakeholders. Based o n the concept o f d i v i s i o n o f labou r ou t l ined in section 6 and the 
p r inc ip les f o r e f fec t ive dialogue spec i f ied in section 8.1 ., re levan t Government, 
Deve lopmen t Partner and non-state actor stakeholders a re expected t o pa r t ic ipa te in 
sector dialogue especially by using Sec to r -W ide Approaches (SWAPS). SWAPS w i l l thus 
s e r v e as instruments for o rgan is ing sector dialogue around strategic issues and ove ra l l 
p o l i c y d i rec t ions rather than f o r dec id ing o n the p r o v i s i o n o f funding. Stakeholders w i l l 
engage in transparent and timely sector dialogue, pa r t icu la r ly f o r sc ru t in is ing spending 
plans, f o r assessing performance in imp lemen t ing sector policies, strategies and plans, the 
effectiveness o f budge t ing and execu t ion and i t s link t o the MKUKUTN MKUZA as 
we l l as linkages with other sectors, and f o r i n f o rm i n g dec is ion -mak ing at sector leve l . 
Sector reviews w i l l also consider the effectiveness o f Deve lopmen t Partner supported 
programmes and projects in con t r ibu t ing t o MKUKUTN MKUZA outcomes. Outputs o f 
sector dialogue w i l l feed i n t o cluster and na t iona l processes (e.g. MKUKUTN MKUZA, 
na t iona l budge tFER , GBS review). Their timing and scope w i l l therefore be a l igned t o 
these processes. A l t h o u g h JAST w i l l guide ove ra l l sector-level dialogue imp rovemen t , 
spec i f ic actions t o enhance dialogue w i l l be decided by each sector, re f lec t ing different 
degrees o f m a t u r i t y in terms o f capacity and ins t i tu t iona l setup. 

9 . Risk mitigation 

Va r ious factors m a y put the imp lemen ta t ion o f the JAST at risk. T h e m a i n r isks t o be 
addressed are po l i t ica l , ins t i tu t iona l and operational, and f iduc ia ry . 

9.1. Po l i t ica l risk 

P o l i t i c a l risk relates t o the non - imp lemen ta t ion o f JAST o r reversal o f the Government’s

the Government’s m o v e away f r o m i t s stated goa l o f w o r k i n g towa rds na t iona l

that Deve lopmen t Partner countries o r headquarters reverse the i r comm i tmen t t o the 
JAST, 
(1) B i l a t e r a l agreements and coun t ry assistance strategies o f Deve lopmen t Partners

The J A S T also requires that Deve lopmen t Partner agencies change the i r practices as w e l l 
as the i r attitude towa rd the Government and development co-operation, adopt a f l e x i b l e 
approach t o the i r development operations and accept that d o i n g business in Tanzania m a y

In J u l y 2006, the Gove rnmen t o f the U n i t e d R e p u b l i c o f Tanzan ia (Governmen t) es tab l ished

T h e D P G has prepared a Jo in t P rog ram D o c um e n t (JPD) as a response t o Tanzania’s second 
generation, results-based Pove r ty R e d u c t i o n Strategies (MKUKUTA f o r m a i n l a n d Tanzania, 
MKUZA fo r Zanzibar), and the JAST . F o r m a n y DPs, the JPD p rov ides a c omm o n frame in 
w h i c h t h e i r i n d i v i d u a l agency p rog rams are embedded. T h e JPD re f lec ts D P G p lanned

T h e Gove rnmen t o f Tanzan ia and c i v i l soc ie ty o rgan iza t ion (CSO) representatives we re

Some DP s w i l l u s e Parts I1 and I11 ve rba t im as core elements o f the i r o w n p r o g r am 
documents; others m a y use Par t I1 and I11 as re ference documents. I n d i v i d u a l DPs might

since 2000, reach ing 6 .8 percen t in 2005 . O v e r the pas t f i v e years, g r ow t h has been l e d by 
mining (1 5 percent), cons t ruc t ion (10 .2 percent), trade (7.2 percent) and c omm u n i c a t i o n (6.1

Box 1: T a n z a n i a ’ s D e b t S u s t a i n a b i l i t y 
Tanzania’s total external debt at end December 2005 was at US$7,93 1.4 m i l l i o n (about 65 percent o f 
GDP) w i t h total domestic debt at TSh.1,625.1 b i l l i o n (about 12 percent o f GDP). A f t e r receiving 
H IPC debt r e l i e f in 2001, Tanzania’s N P V o f debt-to-export ra t io declined to about 130. B y 2004, i t 
had hrther declined to 1 18. 
Re l ie f under the Mu l t i la tera l Debt R e l i e f In i t ia t ive (MDRI) w i l l see Tanzania’s debt burden (up until 
December 2005) cancelled w i t h the Wor ld Bank (IDA), African Development Bank (ADB) and 
IMF. Under the MDRI, the Wo r ld Bank w i l l cance l about SDR 1,898 m i l l i o n or (US$ 2,804.07 
m i l l ion) ; A fr ican Development Fund UA 415.27 m i l l i o n or (US$644.92 m i l l ion) ; and the IMF, 
US $ 3 3 6 m i l l i o n . To ta l cancellation under MDRI i s expected to amount to about US$3,785 m i l l ion ; 
leading to a reduction o f total external debt b y over 45 percent. The IMF MDRI was given in a one 
upfront debt cancellation in January 2006, and the Wo r ld Bank r e l i e f w i l l be spread over the period 
2007-2044 w i t h an average annual saving o f $74m each year. 
Fo l low ing the implementation o f t h e MDRI, Tanzania’s debt sustainability indicators are w e l l be low 
the debt sustainability thresholds. T h e N P V o f debt-to-export ra t io i s estimated to have declined to 
64 percent in 2006. T h e most recen t debt sustainability analysis prepared b y IMF and Wo r ld Bank 
staff concludes that Tanzania’s external debt position i s sustainable, with l o w risk. However, this 
favourable development o f debt indicators depends cr i t ica l ly on sustained economic growth and 
enhanced export performance. 
Russia has also announced i t s intention to cance l bilateral debt and Spain i s expanding i t s debt r e l i e f 
to cover 100 percent o f debt. In addition, progress in securing debt r e l i e f f rom non-Paris Club 
creditors i s cr i t ica l to ensure the continued sustainability o f Tanzania’s debt. Negotiations have been 
concluded w i t h e igh t creditors (Kuwait, India, Bulgaria, China, Hungary, Libya, Slovak Republic, 
and Czech Republic). Negotiations are underway w i t h two creditors (Iran, and Un i ted Arab 
Emirates) and negotiations are pending w i th seven other non-Paris C lub creditors. 

Monetary Policy. Desp i te expans ion o f the m o n e y supply (28 pe rcen t in 2005/06), Tanzan ia 
has gene ra l ly managed t o m a i n t a i n l o w i n f l a t i o n . I n f l a t i o n rose t o 8 pe rcen t in 2006, f u e l l e d

’ The G in i coefficient i s a measure o f inequality o f a distribution. I t i s often used to measure income 
inequality. I t i s a number between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to perfect equality ( i .e . everyone has the

1. MKUKUTA 

Tanzania’s National Strategy f o r Growth and Reduction o f Poverty, k n o w n as the 

MKUKUTA (M k a k a t i w a K u k u z a U c h u m i n a K u p u n g u z a Um a s k i n i Tanzania) was 
comp le ted in June 2005 f o r im p l em e n t a t i o n ove r the p e r i o d 2005-2010. I t i s the successor t o 
Tanzania’s Pove r ty R e d u c t i o n Strategy Paper (a f i r s t gene ra t ion PRSP, f o rm u l a t e d in 2000). 
I t builds o n Tanzania’s Deve lopmen t V is ion 2025, espec ia l ly in i t s emphasis on g r ow t h and 
l o n g t e rm strategy f o r r e d u c i n g a i d dependence.8 MKUKUTA has an increased focus on 
equ i tab le g r ow t h a n d governance, and i s an ins t rumen t f o r m o b i l i z i n g e f f o r t s and resources 
towa rds targe ted p o v e r t y r e d u c t i o n outcomes. MKUKUTA inc ludes targets and p o v e r t y

M i l l e n n i u m D e v e l o pm e n t Goa ls (MDGs). 

MKUKUTA was based o n ex tens ive consu l ta t ions within governmen t , with Par l iamen t , c i v i l 
society, f a i t h based groups, p r i v a t e sector, d is t r ic ts and v i l lages , and deve lopmen t partners. I t 
i s based on the p r i n c i p l e s o f n a t i o n a l ownersh ip , p o l i t i c a l c omm i tm e n t t o democ ra t iza t ion and

development, s treng then ing o f macroeconom ic l i n k s and decen tra l iza t ion , and ma ins t ream ing 
cross-cu t t ing issues. 

MKUKUTA i d e n t i f i e s three clusters o f b r o a d outcomes: (i) g r ow t h o f the economy and 
r e d u c t i o n o f i n c om e pove r ty ; (ii) imp rovemen t o f q u a l i t y o f l i f e and soc ia l w e l l be ing , a n d 
(iii) governance and accoun tab i l i ty . E a c h c lus ter has a set o f goa ls a n d targets, as w e l l as 
re la ted c lus ter strategies (see A n n e x C.) The Gove rnmen t recogn izes that the m o n i t o r i n g and 
eva lua t ion o f MKUKUTA i s essential in p r om o t i n g accoun tab i l i ty a n d in assessing 
deve lopmen ta l e f fec t iveness . Tanzan ia has made cons iderab le e f f o r t s t o deve lop

pu rsued an amb i t ious p r o g r am f o r in teg ra t ion o f ex te rna l f i n a n c i n g within n a t i o n a l systems,

Development V is ion 2025 envisages Tanzania i n 2025 as a nation w i th social and economic justice, rule o f 
law, peace, stability, and unity. I t foresees an educated population, a cultural renaissance, and a strong, 
self-reliant, competitive and sustainable economy. Specific targets for 2025 include: universal primary 
,education and the eradication o f illiteracy, universal access to primary health care and quality reproductive 
services, universal access t o sa fe water, gender equality and empowerment o f women, reduction o f infant 
and maternal mortality rates by three-quarters o f current (1998) levels, food self-sufficiency and food 
security and elimination o f corruption.

PART IV : Wo r ld Bank Group Program w i th Tanzania 

A. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Part I V describes the W o r l d Bank Group (WBG) program w i t h Tanzania over the FY07 - FYlO 
period. I t builds f r om the analysis, commitments and undertakings in Parts I (partnership principles), I1 
and I11 (joint analysis and j o i n t program), reviewed w i t h the authorities. Part I V focuses on the WBG’s 
program and strategic approach, based on lessons f rom the FY01-06 Country Ass is tance Strategy. I t 
includes a description o f on-going and planned analytic wo rk and financing over the FY07-10 period and 
a WBG-specific resu l ts matrix. 

2. W B G support includes: po l icy advice, analytics and financial support f rom the International 
Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Mu l t i la te ra l Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA); p romo t ion o f the private sector and bu i ld ing o f investment capacities by IFC 
and MIGA; as w e l l as learning opportunities b y the WBG, inc lud ing t h e W o r l d Bank Institute (WBI). 

3, 
The W B G overall strategic focus in Tanzania i s to support, along with other Development Partners 
(DPs), implementation o f Tanzania’s strategies fo r growth and reduction o f poverty - M K U K U T A fo r 
mainland Tanzania and MKUZA fo r Zanzibar, 

Box 1: Zanzibar 

Zanzibar, which comprises the islands o f Unguja and Pemba as well as a number o f adjacent islands, i s a highly 
autonomous part o f the United Republic o f Tanzania. Zanzibar and the mainland state o f Tanganyika united on April 
2 6 , 1964, to form the United Republic o f Tanzania. 

Zanzibar has an estimated population o f about one million people, some 2.5 % o f the total population. Although i t i s 
part o f Tanzania, i t has its own government, the Revolutionary Government o f Zanzibar (RGoZ) and elects its own 
president who i s the head o f government. RGoZ has responsibility for matters internal to the island and for overseeing 
development in some key sectors in Zanzibar. I n light o f this responsibility, RGoZ has developed its own poverty 
reduction strategy, called Zanzibar Strategy for Growth and Reduction o f Poverty or MKUZA . 

Following finalization o f the MKUZA in early 2007, and joint work on mapping existing assistance to Zanzibar, the 
authorities and the DPs plan to review their future aid to better align with Zanzibar’s MKUZA . DP support to Zanzibar 
is , for the most part, reflected under the equivalent MKUKUTA clusters. W h e r e Zanzibar presents special issues or 
opportunities these are flagged separately in the text.

Outcome Focus. The FYOl C A S a l igned the WBG’s p rog ram with b road objectives rather than 
outcomes. Progress was t o be measured th rough achievement o f C A S benchmarks, o f ten output rather 
than outcome oriented, o r n o t su f f ic ien t ly linked t o C A S objectives. Some C A S benchmarks were 
ove r ly ambitious, others n o t amb i t ious enough. Building o n the Results M a t r i x f o r a l l DPs in Part 111, 
Part I V includes a WBG spec i f ic results m a t r i x (Annex A) tha t d i rec t ly l i n k s WBG activities with 
milestones and outcomes tha t the WBG expects t o in f luence ove r the FY 0 7 - 1 0 period, w h i c h are 
d i rec t ly related t o MKUKUTA goals and targets. As a result, the WBG m a t r i x facilitates mon i to r ing 
o f progress. Further, as o f FY06 , a l l WBG ac t iv i t ies ( f inanc ia l support and AAA), the annual budget 
a l loca t ion process ( fo r Bank budget), and the Tanzania coun t ry t e am are organized around 
MKUKUTA cluster goals and strategies. 
Partnerships. The FYOl C A S p rov ided a b road f ramewo rk f o r areas o f WBG engagement, a l l ow i n g 
flexibility in respond ing t o n e w developments, such as s ign i f ican t changes in government p r io r i t ies . 
Preserving such f l e x i b i l i t y g o i n g fo rwa rd i s impo r tan t in the WBG p r o g r am with Tanzania. Given the 
strong comm i tmen t o f the Gove rnmen t and DPs t o the MKUKUTA and the JAST , b o t h are expected 
t o rema in ‘living’ documents, updated as necessary t o r em a i n relevant. The WBG intends to continue 
t o w o r k c lose ly with Government, DPs and other stakeholders in areas o f Bank p r io r i t ies , t o mon i to r 
and ensure a l ignmen t o f the p rog ram with MKUKUTA outcomes. 
Aid ModaZitiesMarmonized Approaches. The FYO 1 C A S established impo r tan t foundations f o r 
“new ways o f d o i n g business” with respect t o a i d modalities, focused o n increasing the use o f 
mainstreamed gove rnmen t systems - f inanc ia l management, accounting, auditing, procurement and 
m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion - th rough sector-wide approaches and budge t support. The effectiveness o f 
these approaches compa red with p rev ious ly isolated operations became inc reas ing ly evident du r ing 
the FY2001 -2006 period, pa r t icu la r ly in the health, education and f inanc ia l sectors. This was also 
no ted in the 2005 j o i n t eva lua t ion o f General Budget Support (GBS) t o Tanzania’. The WBG intends 
to continue with a i d moda l i t ies a imed t o achieve greater e f f ic iency and impact, w o r k i n g closely with 
the authorities and other DPs. 
Analytics and Advice. T h e Bank ’s ana ly t ic and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies p r o v i d e d strong support in key 
economic re fo rms in Tanzan ia during the F YO l - 0 6 period, no tab ly in the agriculture, water, p r iva te 
and f inanc ia l sectors. M a i n t a i n i n g strong sector dialogue w i l l b e c r i t i c a l t o the WBG’s fu tu re 
engagement, 
i n f o rm i n g Tanzania’s 
dec is ion -mak ing processes, and p r o v i d i n g ana ly t ica l 
underpinnings f o r IDA f inanc ing . 

PortfoZio Management. In January 2007, the IDA p o r t f o l i o in Tanzania inc luded 2 0 programs and 
projects, with 2 p ro jec ts at risk, and 6.3% comm i tmen ts at risk (see A n n e x D). The p o r t f o l i o also 
included 6 reg iona l p ro jec ts with ac t iv i t ieskomponen ts in Tanzania (see A n n e x K.) Tanzania’s risk 
management pe r fo rmance has been above average f o r the A f r i c a Reg ion . The strong performance i s 
attributed t o im p r o v i n g q u a l i t y o f p ro jec t preparation, imp lemen ta t ion and supervision. Government 
leadership o f the deve lopmen t agenda and strategic choices has mean t stronger country ownership. 
While m u c h remains t o be done, there has also been somewhat greater emphasis o n ha rmon iza t ion and 
alignment and o n designing and implementing results-based M o n i t o r i n g and Eva lua t ion systems at the 
onset o f projects. M o r e fundamentally, the WBG coun t ry team i s highly decentralized with mos t

Box 2: Growth-Related Findings o f the 2006 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 

Recent acceleration in g r ow t h i s grounded in macro-economic s tab i l iza t ion and far-reach ing structural reforms. 
G r ow t h has also benefited substantially f r om demand-side impulses - increased government spending financed by 
h igher tax revenues and a id f lows . As g r ow t h in government spending slows, the locomo t ive f o r g row th w i l l need to 
sh i f t t o increased demand f o r exports and domestically produced goods, requiring Tanzania t o strengthen 
substantially i t s in terna t iona l competitiveness, accelerate structural change, and safeguard the environment w h i l e 
ma in ta in ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . 

Faster progress i s needed o n reduc ing the cost o f do ing business, inter a l ia by s im p l i f y i n g the regulatory and 
l icens ing reg ime and im p r o v i n g access t o justice, w h i c h w i l l improve access t o credit. Government has the 
opportunity, w i t h substantial aid, t o remove key energy and transport bottlenecks in a env ironmen ta l ly sustainable 
manner. 

Long- term s truc tura l change requires expansion and qua l i ty improvements in pos t-pr imary education. In addition, 
government support i s needed f o r communication, infrastructure and innovation, i n c l u d i n g fo re ign direct investment 
that br ings increased access t o and adaptation o f new technologies, and incen t ives f o r entrepreneurial activities. 
These measures are expected t o support p roduc t ion o f a w iden ing range o f produc ts and services in Tanzania. 

The C E M underlines tha t con t inued fast g r ow t h o f the manu fac tur ing sector i s c r i t i c a l f o r Tanzania’s sustained 
economic g row th and s truc tura l transformation. However, in order t o generate shared g r ow t h tha t benefits the poor, 
greater attention t o sustainable development o f r u r a l areas i s necessary. Census and pove r ty surveys show strong 
inter and in t ra reg iona l differences in pove r ty and growth. 

T o date, the impac t o f re forms has been visible p r im a r i l y in urban areas, especially D a r es Salaam. The C E M 
h igh l igh ts four areas where the authorities shou ld scale-up re forms w i t h a r u r a l focus:

ii. transport sector, by scaling up investments and furthering efforts to strengthen the finances and 
independence o f the Road Agency, and b y reducing inter-modal r a i l and po r t bottlenecks, with a 
focus on strengthening transport l i n k s ; 
iii. legalhegulatory environment, where Tanzania was among the top 10 reformers last year (2007 
D o i n g Bus iness indicators), although s t i l l lagging in performance at 142 out o f 175 countries; 
iv. rural productivity, p r inc ipa l ly through support for the agriculture sector development program; 
v. energy, to overcome the huge backlog in financing o f maintenance and distribution, to identify a 
least cost investment plan, and to strengthen key sector institutions, such as TANESCO and the 
Regulator, EWURA; 
vi. protecting the natural resource base through: a sustainable minerals project to help improve 
corporate governance in m ine ra l extraction, and address environment, safety and value addition 
challenges o f small-scale mining; a fo l low -on L a k e V ic to r ia program dealing with increasingly 
d i f f icu l t inter-sector issues ; and sustainable management o f coastal and deep sea fishing resources, 
together with protection o f the livelihoods o f small scale fishing communities, through the 
ongoing Ma r ine and Coastal Environmental Management Program - mainland Tanzania and 
Zanzibar recently agreed o n a revenue-sharing fo rmu la that had hitherto hindered cooperation, and 
on creation o f a shared Deep Sea F ish ing Authority; and 
v i i . regional integration, bu i ld ing f r om the solid po r t fo l io o f activities that support East A f r ican 
integration (eg. the Trade and Transport Fac i l i ta t ion Project and the L a k e V ic to r ia Environmental 
Program), with new support for the East A f r i c a Power Poo l and a Regional Communication 
Infrastructure Project, complemented b y analytical wo rk to support po l icy and financing choices. 

B o x 3 : Energy 

Energy i s a key constraint to growth in Tanzania, notably for energy-intensive businesses such as mining, and to 
ensuring a healthy, well-educated workforce, and achievement o f the MDGs. Particularly in urban centers, growing 
at twice the overall economic growth rate o f Tanzania, there i s huge unmet electricity demand among small and 
medium businesses - these otherwise have to rely on generators costing twice to three times as much as grid 
electricity. Currently overall access to electricity in Tanzania i s estimated at lo%, with only 2% in r u r a l areas, and 
overall generating capacity i s 1084 MW, including 561 MW hydro and 180 MW leased for a relatively short period. 

Expanding access requires substantial investment in generation, transmission and distribution given the country’s 
size and low connectivity. Recurrent droughts have highlighted the vulnerability to dependence on hydropower. I n 
2006, as in other drought-prone years, there was massive load-shedding, compounded by inadequate investment i n 
alternatives to hydro-power, and poor management o f the sector, including o f Tanzania’s Generation, Transmission 
and Distribution company (TANESCO). While the economic impact i s difficult to quantify, given the informality o f 
much business, GDP growth could have been 2 percentage points l e s s as a result o f problems in the power sector. 

Rainfall in 2007 has improved considerably. This, together with the 180 MW o f emergency generation capacity, the 
planned addition o f 145 M W from new permanent plants later this year, and new management at TANESCO, 
provides a new opportunity to put the sector on a sound footing for the longer term. Among the key challenges are: 
(i) need for suitable PPP framework to encourage provision o f least cost generation by the private sector; (ii) 
independence o f TANESCO to operate commercially; (iii) agreement on least cost investment plan for generation, 
transmission and distribution, together with finance at an affordable price; (iv) regional electricity interconnection, 
through East and Southern African power pools; and (v) access expansion, including primarily intensification among 
the high growth areas o f the country.

whereas support for tertiary and vocational education and training i s expected to be in the fo rm o f analysis 
and investment financing, as i s support fo r Zanzibar’s basic education improvement program. 

16. The Bank’s support to health focuses on imp rov ing the system’s capacity to deliver quality s e r v i c e s 
by imp rov ing allocative and technical efficiency. This i s expected t o strengthen capacity o f both public 
and private providers to deliver quality health services to a g row ing and urbanizing population, w i t h 
particular attention to the poor and vulnerable. An on-going investment program in health w i l l be 
extended through FY 10 with supplemental financing to address short term financing gaps in AIDS and 
malaria. Thereafter, the Bank’s health financing i s expected to be p rov ided through PRSCs. The Bank w i l l 
continue to provide expertise and global experience on reproductive and maternal health, health financing 
and health insurance, human resources, and public-private partnerships. In addition, the Bank w i l l support 
imp rov ing Tanzania’s capacity to respond to and mitigate the effects o f regional and global epidemics. 
I F C support i s being explored fo r private hospitals and pharmacies, and the production o f long-lasting, 
insecticide-treated malaria bednets. An improved multi-sector response t o malnutrition in Tanzania 
(supported through analysis and a Dutch Trust Fund) i s expected t o contribute toward greater educational 
attainment, productivity and growth. The Bank w i l l also provide analysis and advice on how to better 
manage social risk and reach the vulnerable members o f the community. 

17. The Bank i s currently supporting development o f the second Na t iona l Multi-sector Strategic 
Framework fo r H I V / A I D S under the Tanzania Multisectoral Aids Project (TMAP), which w i l l continue 
through FY08. Given the large number o f DPs with earmarked financing fo r HIV/AIDS, the Bank intends 
to mainstream i t s financing through PRSCs, as we l l as through components in ongoing and pipeline 
programs such as TASAF 11, energy, m in ing and transport. The Bank w i l l continue to provide technical 
advice on H I V / A I D S financing and M&E, and together w i t h WB I , i s also exploring options to j o i n t l y 
support capacity bu i ld ing o n governance and accountability for H I V / A I D S programs. 

18. The Bank i s supporting a recen t ly approved comprehensive 5-year Water Sector Development 
Program. This program, put together over the past two years based on analytical wo rk by Government and 
the Bank, has led to a comprehensive Water Sector Policy and investment plan. Financing i s being 
complemented b y technical support in sanitation and hygiene promotion, through the Bank’s Water & 
Sanitation Program - Africa, with support f rom the Gates Foundation and the regional N i l e Basin 
Initiative. IFC i s supporting development o f f ive “small town” water utility models on public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) to improve water and sanitation se rv ices and t o promote commercial u t i l i t y practices.

Box 4: Expanding Demand f o r Governance and Anti-corruption (GAC) 

The WBG i s committed to help develop more capable and more accountable states and institutions that can devise 
and implement sound policies, provide public services, set the r u l e s governing markets, and control corruption. 
Governance and anti-corruption (GAC) are an integral part o f the development challenge. State and non-state 
stakeholders can help shape the quality o f governance and impact development outcomes. 

DPs have harmonized their dialogue on GAC through the Tanzanian Governance Working Group (GWG), currently 
led by Denmark, with the WBG as an active participant. In December 2006 and January 2007, the GWG convened a 
se r ies o f consultations with Government, Parliamentarians, Non-State Actors and DPs on the Bank’s ro le . 

Participants valued the opportunity to speak about Governance issues openly in an informal environment. 
Government welcomed the Bank’s global knowledge and support on these topics, as well as the synergy from 
common DP financing that helped to strengthen key governance and accountability systems, including the budget, 
financial management, audits, procurement. Parliamentarians appreciated being included in a dialogue from which 
they indicated they are often marginalized, and recommended that this type o f exchange continue. Non-State actors 
reflected a strong ana ly t ic grasp o f the GAC issues and echoed many o f the same concerns as the parliamentarians. 
DPs used this process to help further improve coordination o f their GAC efforts. 

The following were key recommendations to DPs: (i) support strengthening o f fiduciary systems; (ii) reduce DP 
conditionalities; (iii) support better definition o f results and monitoring o f achievements, including qualitatively on 
how results are achieved, how much i s achieved, and at what cost; (iv) support Parliament and C iv i l Society’s 
capacity to hold the executive accountable; and (v) help with reforms aimed at upholding rule o f law, reforming the 
legal framework, providing quality public information in a sufficiently disaggregated and timely fashion, and 
monitoring service delivery at the district and village levels. In addition, stakeholders reiterated the need for the 
country to remain i n the driver’s seat and fo r development partners to support domestic initiatives.

22. Support to the demand s ide o f good governance, including strengthening the capacity o f non-state 
actors, contributes to greater transparency in the use o f public funds. The Bank i s p rov id ing financial 
support to demand-side accountability through an Accountability, Transparency, and Integrity Project. I t 
supports strengthening the legal sector, a Na t iona l An t i -Co r rup t ion Strategy and Ac t ion Plan, and 
Oversight and Watchdog Institutions - such as Parliament, the media and c i v i l society organizations. 
W B I plans complementary support fo r a stronger media and Parliament. The Bank’s on-going financial 
support to community-based development through TASAF I1 (which inc ludes support to Zanzibar), i s 
also designed to strengthen demand-side accountability. When TASAF I1 i s mainstreamed (most likely by 
FY 10) the Bank w i l l remain engaged through a strong AAA program - see Table 4. 

23. Joint DP financial and procurement management assessments w i l l continue, w i t h a v iew t o 
mitigating risks o f weak fiduciary capacity. Analyses are also planned on the governance challenges o f 
rap id urbanization and on deepening our understanding o f the po l i t ica l economy (including Zanzibar), so 
as to help guide appropriate po l icy and program choices. Bu i ld ing on wo rk already undertaken b y the 
DPG, the Bank, in consultation with DPs, also plans to study governance issues related to the 
management o f natural resources in two or th ree sectors (forestry, f ishe r ies and/or minerals), covering a 
broad range o f issues such as pub l ic financial management, human resources management, legal aspects, 
etc. To mitigate perceived extra fiduciary risks on Zanzibar, due to limited capacity bu i ld ing over the past 
several years, additional support and oversight i s being provided fo r projects and programs there at bo th 
design and implementation stages. Ongoing analytical wo rk i s expected to lead to financial and technical 
support fo r public service and pub l ic financial management reforms. 

24. Strengthening Tanzania’s M&E systems w i l l be particularly important to enhance the focus on 
resu l ts and improved governance over the FY07-10 period. De lay in carrying out a Household Budget 
Survey (HBS) has meant that there i s no update on poverty in Tanzania s ince 2001, a real drawback for 
decision-making. The HBS survey i s currently ongoing. In 2008, a Na t iona l Panel Survey w i l l be ro l led 
out. This w i l l facilitate annual data and analysis on poverty and income dynamics, better tracking o f 
trends, and more timely feedback on the impact o f po l icy choices. The Bank i s well placed to support the 
resu l ts agenda through advice and financing fo r the statistical master plan, as w e l l as capacity 
improvements at national and sector leve ls . 

3. Partnership - Principles and Practice 
25. To m e e t Tanzania’s development goals, Government and DPs have co-signed a set o f partnership 
principles that are, in some cases, more ambitious than the Paris Declaration o n Aid Effectiveness.’ Table 
2 contains baseline data on the Paris indicators fo r the Bank’s support to Tanzania. I t also contains Bank- 
specific targets for 201 0 based on an assessment o f foreseen developments, notably planned change in aid 
modalities. Compliance i s to be monitored annually through the JAST Mon i to r ing F r a m e w ~ r k . ~

Box 5: Draft Principles fo r Shifting to Budget Support @PL) 

. 
. 

. 

The shift in aid modalities-away 
from specific investment operations to development policy financing-requires 
individual sectors/programs to be able to use such funds effectively. An appropriate policy and institutional 
framework i s needed. The following optimal principles are unlikely to be fully met, but taken together, should help 
assess whether a particular sector or context i s ready for budget support, and also flag where there may be need for 
risk mitigation measures and capacity development. 
1. The Policy and Institutional Framework 
Policy Framework - an acceptable policy and institutional sector framework which includes the set o f laws, 
regulations, practices, and institutions that make the system work. 
Sector Strategy - a costed medium- to long-term sector strategy, consistent with overall macro/fiscal 
framework, also addressing distributional and environmental aspects, including an M&E Framework. 
Budget Framework and Expenditure Control. A r e mechanisms in place for sector to appropriately utilize 
Annual Review - are there inclusive, annual review processes which assess the status o f the sector strategy 
adequate financing through annual Government budget process (both allocations and final outturn)? 
implementation (both progradproject implementation and outcomes)? 
2. Ownership 
Track Record - does the Government program show solid progradproject implementation and results? 
Participatory Processes and Consultation - i s policy formation, program design, program implementation 
and M&E conducted in an open and transparent manner? 
. Program Design 
. Program Implementation 
Capacity of Ministries, Departments and Agencies 
Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Capacity, including transparency and external oversight

30. 
Investment lending through Baskets in Support of Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps). 
The Bank i s p rov id ing financing through basket funds in support o f SWAps fo r the fo l low ing 
sectors: private sector development (including support 
fo r the Bus iness Environment 
Strengthening fo r Tanzania), together with Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK; 
agriculture, together with Denmark, EC, IFAD, Ireland and Japan; financial sector, together w i t h 
Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK; tax modernization, together w i t h Denmark, 
EC, Germany and UK; water, together with the A f r ican Development Bank, Belgium, EIB, 
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland; health, together with Canada, Denmark, 
Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Switzerland and UNFPA; public service reform, together w i t h 
Canada, Denmark and UK; and legal sector re fo rm together w i t h Denmark and Sweden. Basket 
funds in support fo r SWAps a re also expected fo r public financial management reform, forestry, 
transport and the next generation o f pub l ic sector reforms. 

31. 
Investment lending outside of Baskets. In l i n e with Partnership Principles, stand alone 
investment financing w i l l continue to complement sector and general budget support, for 
example, for large-scale infrastructure, fo r p i lo t ing new approaches, and fo r particularly complex 
investments where other regional country partners a re involved. Where investment financing i s 
maintained, IDA financing i s l i k e l y to remain large relative to other DPs - historically f ive times 
the average annual resource flow per donor per operation, and almost twice that o f the next 
largest donor. Inputs at this scale help keep overall aid transaction costs low, and underline the 
need fo r any changes in IDA financing modalities and sector choices to be gradual and carefully 
planned.

TANZANIA CAS COMPLETION REPORT 

Da te o f CAS : June 30 ,2000 
Pe r iod covered by the C A S C om p l e t i o n Report: FY 200 1-2006 

Overview 

1. 
This repo r t represents an assessment o f the W o r l d B a n k C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy (CAS) f isca l 
years 2001-2003 f o r the U n i t e d Repub l ic o f Tanzania. Given the need t o a l i g n with the Government’s 
new Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (MKUKUTA after i t s Sw a h i l i acronym) and Jo in t Assistance Strategy 
for Tanzania (JAST), as w e l l as the agreement among development partners (DPs) t o prepare a j o i n t 
partnership program, the Bank postponed development o f i t s n e w C A S beyond the fo rma l C A S pe r iod . 
This C A S C om p l e t i o n Repo r t (CAS CR ) and any reference t o the “CAS pe r iods ” therefore cover f isca l 
years 200 1-2006. 

2. 
The key ob jec t ive o f the C A S C R i s t o evaluate the Bank’s c o n t r i b u t i o n t ow a r d outcomes within 
the C A S f ramewo rk (see A n n e x F 1 1 o f the 2000 CAS). The Tanzania C A S f ramewo rk f o l l ow e d the 
standard fo rma t o f such f ramewo rks at t h e time. I t was organized a round ob jec t ives rather than 
outcomes and h igh l igh ted strategies and actions, adjustments/ benchmarks, measurement tools, partner 
programs and Bank ins t rumen ts a l igned with these objectives. 

3 . 

Part A o f this C A S C R discusses the country’s long - and med ium - te rm strategic goals t o w h i c h the 
Bank’s strategy was aligned. Part B focuses o n the strategic ob jec t ives o f the C A S and discusses 
whether o r n o t the B a n k con t r ibu ted t o outcomes within these objectives. Pa r t C evaluates the Bank’s 
p o r t f o l i o performance ove r the C A S pe r iod . Part D p rov ides lessons learned and highlights the i s s u e s 
that should be dealt with in the n e x t CAS .

Long-Term Strategic Goals, CAS Objectives and CAS Implementation 

4. 
Tanzania’s Deve lopmen t V i s i o n 2025 f r o m 1995 envisions “[. . .] tha t Tanzania w i l l have 
graduated f r o m a least deve loped coun t ry t o a m i d d l e income coun t ry by the year 2025 with a high l e v e l 
o f human development”. In 1997, Tanzania developed the N a t i o n a l Pove r ty E rad ica t ion Strategy 
(NPES) as an ac t ion p l a n t o advance the objectives f o r pove r ty e rad ica t ion as spelled ou t in the 
Deve lopmen t V i s i o n until 2010. The N P E S iden t i f ied t h r e e areas o f strategic interventions name ly : (i) 
creating an enab l ing env i ronmen t f o r pove r ty eradication; (ii) building the capacity f o r pove r ty 
eradication; and (iii) e rad ica t ing pove r ty . 

5 . 

Tanzania f ina l ized i t s f i r s t Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) in October 2000’. As an 
in teg ra l pa r t o f the Highly Indeb ted Poo r Coun t ry (HIPC) in i t ia t ive , t h e PRSP was prepared with the 
active invo lvemen t o f na t iona l and in te rna t iona l stakeholders ( inc lud ing c i v i l society). D r aw i n g f r o m 
the Deve lopmen t V i s i o n and t h e NPES , i t defined short- and med ium - te rm targets o n pove r ty reduc t ion 

An Interim-PRSP was discussed by the IDA Board on March 2000.

policies, actions and ins t i tu t iona l changes necessary f o r reduc ing income and non - income pove r ty and 
im p r o v i n g l iv ing standards. 

6. 
The strategic d i rec t ions o f the f i r s t PRSP encompassed three b road p r i o r i t y areas: i) increasing 
g r ow t h and c rea t ing econom ic oppo r tun i t ies f o r the poo r ; ii) enhancing human capabilities; and iii) 
increasing empowe rmen t and accoun tab i l i ty . Furthermore, the PRSP de f ined p r i o r i t y sectors f o r 
pove r ty - focused budge t expenditures name ly health, p r im a r y education, water, lega l and j u d i c i a l 
systems, r u r a l roads and agriculture. Since the launch o f the PRSP, the Gove rnmen t issued t h r e e PRSP 
Progress Reports, f o l l ow e d by IDA-IMF Jo in t S t a f f Assessments. 

7. 

The M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) have gu ided PRSP targets, a l though the tw o 
t ime l ines are d i f fe ren t - t h e t im e h o r i z o n o f the latest PRSP, aka MKUKUTA, i s 2 0 1 0, while the M D G s 
t ime l ine i s 2015. The PRSP targets are m o r e amb i t ious than the M D G s in some areas, l e s s in others. 
F o r example, w h i l e the MDGs a i m at h a l v i n g the percentage o f peop le l iv ing b e l ow the na t iona l pove r ty 
l i n e by 2015 ( f r om a 1990 baseline), the PRSPs a i m at ach iev ing th is target by 2010. The PRSPs a im at 
a reduc t ion o f ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y t o 265 pe r 100,000 l i v e births by 2010, w h i l e t h e MDG target i s 133 - 
?4 o f the 1990 baseline o f 530 (see table 1 o f the Jo in t P rog ram Documen t f o r a compa r ison between a l l 
MKUKUTA targets and the MDGs i n c l u d i n g their current status). 

8 . 

In pa ra l le l with the PRSP, the Gove rnmen t launched a Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS) in June 
2002. This p r o v i d e d a f ramewo rk f o r o rgan iz ing dono r assistance a round PRSP p r io r i t ies and gave 
directions f o r inc reas ing the percentage o f a i d go ing th rough the budget. The 2000 C A S was in fo rmed 
by the strategic p r io r i t ies de f ined in t h e TAS and in the PRSP.

9. 
This section discusses C A S outcomes based o n the C A S f ramewo rk . The C A S was organized 
around the three PRSP p r i o r i t y areas with several development objectives unde r each p r i o r i t y area (a 
t o t a l o f 24 C A S objectives). In some cases, o n l y qua l i ta t ive benchmark ind ica to rs were iden t i f ied and 
m a n y ind ica to rs lacked clear targets. The C A S recogn ized the inadequacy o f data and M&E sys tems t o 
repo r t o n outcomes pa r t icu la r ly with respect t o B a n k outcomes. In addition, results-based partnership 
programs r em a i n challenging, as i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o isolate W o r l d B a n k G roup con t r ibu t ions Erom other 
influences. E i the r the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ions are eas i ly t racked at a task level, but i t remains re la t ive ly 
hard t o trace causality, o r they requ i re a separate M&E system that distracts f r o m con t r ibu t ion t o 
country-based goals. 

10. Based o n the f o l l ow i n g assessment o f C A S benchmarks in add i t ion t o the outcomes achieved 
within each C A S objective, th is C A S C R rates the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion t o results ove r the C A S pe r iod as 
sa t is fac to ry .

C A S stated that: “Many o f these benchmarks are qua l i ta t ive (or represent process indicators), a 
re f lec t ion o f the inadequate statistical base, pa r t icu la r ly f o r human development, and the fact that r e f o rm 
outcomes n e e d t o be measured over a l o n g time horizon”.

the f o l l ow i n g analysis suggests, IDA made pove r ty eradication a central focus during imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the 2000 C A S - in some areas m o r e successfully, in others less successfully. The baseline f o r 
Tanzania’s development status as w e l l as the ana ly t ic underpinning f o r po l ic ies was p r o v i d e d by a 
Coun t ry Econom ic M em o r a n d um (CEM)-Tanzania 
at the Turn of the Century ca r r ied ou t in 2001. 
The study iden t i f ied inadequate cap i ta l accumulation, p r o d u c t i v i t y growth, p o o r support f o r the 
t rans fo rma t ion o f agriculture, d is rup ted progress in building human cap i ta l and delayed demographic 
t rans i t ion as the m a i n factors behind Tanzania’s s l ow development progress. A mo re recent C E M and 
Pove r ty Assessment (Sus ta in ing and Sharing Econom ic G row th ) was ca r r ied ou t during 2005-2006.

also attempts to determine ru ra l poverty by projecting ru ra l per capita consumption forward and 
backward using the 2000/2001 HBS data. The analysis suggests a decline in ru ra l poverty f rom 38.6 
percent in 2001 to 33.8 percent in 2004. However, due to uncertainties with assumptions, a lower

were produced and the GDP was rebased. Government also prepared annual PRSP progress reports, 
reviewed and substantially imp roved the poverty mon i to r ing system, and prepared the M K U K U T A . 

20. Notwithstanding progress in collecting and publishing economic statistics and administrative data, 
quality and t ime l iness rema in uneven. A lso the frequency o f poverty statistics (currently every 8 years) 
needs to be improved. T o address this, the Na t iona l Bureau o f Statistics has embarked o n a statistical 
master plan, whose development and implementation i s fully integrated in the M K U K U T A monitoring 
system. A new labor force su rvey was fielded in 2006, another HBS w i l l be fielded in 2007, and new 
labor and poverty statistics are expected fo r 2007 and 2008 respectively. A national pane l survey i s 
being prepared to: strengthen mon i to r ing o f MKUKUTA, facilitate impact evaluation, and provide 
quality data on changes in household welfare (including h i g h frequency pove r ty statistics).

CAS Objective 6: Address issue o f heavy external debt burden 
CAS Benchmarks 

Status 

30. At time o f CAS design, Tanzania’s debt burden was considered unsustainable. At end-June 1999, 
Tanzania’s external pub l ic debt amounted to US$6.9billion in nominal t e r m s or 439 percen t o f the three- 
year average o f exports. One o f the key goals o f the CAS was therefore to reach H IPC completion point 
by the end o f f isca l 2001. After receiving H IPC debt r e l i e f in 2001, Tanzania’s N P V o f debt-to-export 
ra t io declined to about 130. B y 2004, i t had further declined to 1 18. 

3 1. R e l i e f under t h e Mu l t i la te ra l Debt R e l i e f In i t ia t ive (MDRI) w i l l see Tanzania’s debt obligations 
(up until December 2005) cancelled w i t h the Wo r ld Bank (IDA), African Development Bank (ADB) 
and IMF. Under t h e MDRI, the W o r l d Bank w i l l cancel about US$2,804 m i l l ion . Total cancellation 
under MDRI (including ADB and IMF) i s expected to amount to about US$3,785 m i l l ion ; leading to a 
reduction o f total external debt b y over 45 percent. Fo l low ing the implementation o f the MDRI, 

Tanzania’s debt sustainability indicators are well below the debt sustainability thresholds. The N P V o f 

debt-to-export ratio i s estimated to have dec l ined to 64 percen t in 2006. The most recen t debt 
sustainability analysis prepared by IMF and Wo r ld Bank staff concludes that Tanzania’s external 
debt position i s sustainable, w i th low risk. The objective i s therefore considered achieved.

Pove r ty and Soc ia l Im p a c t Assessment (PS IA ) o n L o c a l Gove rnmen t T a x a t i o n Reform i n Tanzan ia . The 
study examined the “intended and un in tended consequences o n pove r ty reduc t ion and g r ow t h in 
Tanzania o f the tax re fo rms imp lemen ted in June 2003 and 2004”. Some o f the mo re tangible r e f o rm 
outcomes inc lude : (i) sampled households recorded a re la t ive ly sma l l 0.8 percent dec l ine in tax 
payments overall, a l though the impac t across social groups was “steeply progressive”; (ii) businesses 
recorded a 14 percent decrease in tax bu rden overall-medium 
size businesses reco rded 11 percent less 
tax, sma l l businesses 36 percent less, a l though m i c r o businesses (with unde r Tsh 54,000 turnover) 
recorded 11 percent m o r e tax; and (iii) evidence f r o m d is t r ic t councils suggest that they have been

There i s some danger that the p rev ious m u l t i p l i c i t y o f l o c a l c o u n c i l taxes w i l l be reproduced in the 
f o r m o f a d i f fe ren t array o f m i n o r and “nuisance” taxes tha t represent imag ina t ive use o f tax types

Tanzania’s citizens and businesses, with the p rov iso that th is w o u l d need t o substitute for, rather than 
add to, m u l t i p l e other taxes and dues and levies”. Ove ra l l the study concludes that: “the 2003 and 2004 
tax re fo rms were a la rge step in t h e right d i rec t ion towards a l o c a l gove rnmen t taxa t ion system that

Box 3: Tanzania’s energy challenges 
In retrospect, the C A S fa i led t o h i g h l i g h t energy as a foca l area fo r the Bank. Some attempts were made t o 
correct this, inc lud ing the emergency powe r pro jec t and the Songo Songo Gas Deve lopmen t and Power 
Generation pro jec t . 
Tanzania reduced i t s reliance o n l o w cost hyd ro power - f r om 80 percent t o less than 40 percent between 
2002 and 2006. However, this was n o t enough to avo id massive load shedding in 2003 and again in 2006, 
due t o droughts, h i g h wo r ldw ide o i l prices, and lack o f ac t ion o n the cost and p r i c i n g f ron t (leading to 
deferred investment, repairs and maintenance). The cost o f l o a d shedding t o the economy i s estimated t o 
be about 2 percent o f GDP in 2006, w i thou t fac tor ing in the costs o f poo r qua l i ty o f e lec tr ic i ty and unmet 
demand, and a p ro - r ich p r i c i n g p o l i c y . 

The poor performance o f the sector was exacerbated by management changes in TANESCO , the 
Government-owned E lec t r ic i ty Generation and D i s t r i b u t i o n Company. A t the same time, demand f o r 
e lec tr ic i ty i s g r ow i n g at about 10 percent each year, w i t h o n l y 10 percent o f the popu la t ion h a v i n g access. 

There appear t o be good prospects f o r an expansion in re l iab le e lec tr ic i ty supply in 2007, due t o improved 
rainfalls, acqu is i t ion o f emergency generation capacity, strengthening management and overs igh t o f the 
sector, inc lud ing the E l e c t r i c i t y Regulator, EWURA. Systemic sector challenges remain, c a l l i n g fo r b o t h

the need t o address linkages between incentives, p o l i c y change, modern iza t ion o f systems and processes,

fiscal 2004-2006 at US$1,557.3 m i l l i o n more than double the actual lending amount o f US$727 m i l l i o n 
over fiscal 2001-2003. The reason fo r this increase i s two fo ld : (i) Tanzania’s CP IA continued to 
strengthen during this period, and (ii) projects under preparation during 2000-2003 only became ready 
for implementation in 2004-2006. For example, three investment operations were delayed f rom f i s c a l 
200 1-2003. The PRSC ser ies continued during fiscal 2004-2006. 

95. A l l operations approved during fiscal 2004-2006 were within the CAS framework, which remained 
relevant throughout. A second health sector development program and a second social action fund build 
on earlier operations. The secondary education development program, agriculture sector development 
program, financial sector support and tax modernization also fo l lowed earlier interventions. These 
managed to build crucial foundations (e.g. increased primary enrollment, improved tax administration, 
agriculture research, extension and empowerment, financial sector assessments) and consolidated and 
broadened the Bank’s focus. Emergency power, marine and coastal management, as we l l as private 
sector/MSME competitiveness, were within the CAS framework, responding to emerging priorities.

pe rcen t o f Tanzania operations assessed during FYO 1-06 as satisfactory fo r development outcomes as

disbursement ratio also improved. Between fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2006, the po r t fo l io grew f rom 18 to

Lessons Learned 

9 7 . 

C A S C R findings were rev iewed by an extended Tanzania Coun t ry Team, i n c l u d i n g 
representatives f r o m va r ious Bank G roup networks, sector and ope ra t iona l support units, in a C A S 
preparation retreat in Dar es Salaam o n January 22 -23 , 2007. Discussions and presentations 
concentrated o n wha t wen t w e l l and n o t so well during the C A S pe r iod , and o n opportunities and threats 
go ing fo rwa rd . 

98 . The Coun t ry Team be l ieved the f o l l ow i n g wen t w e l l during the FYO1-06 pe r iod : (i) flexibility to 
respond t o n e w government p r io r i t ies and emergencies; (ii) greater pa r tne rsh ip and ha rmon iza t ion with 
the authorities and DPs; (iii) a l ignmen t with PRSP objectives; (iv) outcomes t o w h i c h the B a n k

budget support con t r ibu ted t o im p r o v e d a i d de l ive ry and greater impac t . Thing tha t wen t less well 
included: (a) measu r ing and m o n i t o r i n g o f results; (b) supervision o f C A S imp lemen ta t ion ; (c) r o l e o f 
Coun t ry Team in des ign ing the CAS ; (d) cap tu r ing cross-sector con t r ibu t ions t o results; and (e) capacity 
building. 

99 . Lessons learned based o n the findings o f this report, discussions with the authorities, other DPs and 
within the Coun t ry Team can be g rouped around f i v e themes : a) ou tcome focus; b) partnership; c) 
ha rmon ized a i d modalities; d) analytics and advice (AAA); and e) p o r t f o l i o management. 

Focus on Outcomes. The 2000 C A S a l igned the W o r l d B a n k G roup p rog ram with b road objectives 
rather than outcomes. Progress was t o be measured th rough achievement o f C A S benchmarks, o f ten 
output rather than outcome orientated, o r n o t su f f ic ien t ly l i n k e d t o C A S objectives. Some C A S 
benchmarks were o v e r l y ambitious, others n o t amb i t ious enough. The n e w C A S w i l l need t o inc lude a 
comprehensive m o n i t o r i n g f ramewo rk with a l o g i c a l causal cha in tha t l i n k s coun t ry goals with outcomes 
and outputs, as w e l l as milestones tha t w i l l fac i l i ta te m o n i t o r i n g o f progress at va r ious stages o f the C A S 
pe r iod . 

Partnerships. The 2000 C A S p r o v i d e d a b road and f l e x i b l e f ramewo rk f o r areas o f B a n k engagement, 
w h i c h p roved c r i t i c a l t o respond ing t o n e w developments, updated i n f o rm a t i o n as w e l l as t o any 
s ign i f ican t changes in gove rnmen t p r io r i t ies . Preserving such f l e x i b i l i t y i s impo r tan t . The n e w C A S 
shou ld rema in a l iv ing document, t o be mon i to red regularly and updated as necessary t o rema in relevant. 
The Bank ’s Coun t ry Team shou ld con t inue t o w o r k c lose ly with Government, DPs and other 
stakeholders in areas o f B a n k p r io r i t ies , t o mon i to r and ensure a l ignmen t o f the p rog ram with 
MKUKUTA outcomes. 

Aid Modalities/Harmonized approaches. The 2000 C A S established impo r tan t foundations f o r “new 
ways o f d o i n g business” with respect to a i d modalities, focused o n use o f mainstreamed government 
systems-financial management, accounting, auditing, procurement and m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation- 
th rough sector w i d e approaches and budge t support. The effectiveness o f these approaches compared 

65 

with p rev ious ly iso la ted operations became inc reas ing ly evident during the 2000-2006 period, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the health, education and f inanc ia l sectors. This was also no ted in the j o i n t evaluation o f 
general budget support t o Tanzania. The B a n k shou ld continue t o focus o n a i d moda l i t ies aimed t o 
achieve greater e f f ic iency and impact, and o n w o r k i n g closely with other Deve lopmen t Partners. 

Analytics and Advice. The Bank ’s ana ly t ic and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies p r o v i d e d s t rong support in k e y 
economic re fo rms in Tanzania during the 2000-2006 period, no tab ly in the agriculture, water, p r iva te 
and f inanc ia l sectors. M a i n t a i n i n g s t rong sector dialogue w i l l be c r i t i c a l t o the Bank ’s future 
engagement in Tanzania, i n f o rm i n g Tanzania’s dec is ion -mak ing processes, and p r o v i d i n g ana ly t ica l 
underpinnings f o r IDA f inanc ing . 

Portfolio Management. As o f January 2007, the IDA p o r t f o l i o inc luded 2 0 p rog rams and projects, 
with 2 projects at risk, and 6.3 percent comm i tmen ts at r isk . Tanzania’s r i s k management performance 
has been above average f o r the A f r i c a R e g i o n over the past 5 years, with p r o a c t i v i t y at 100 percent. The 
strong performance i s a t t r ibu ted t o im p r o v i n g qua l i ty o f p ro jec t preparation, imp lemen ta t ion and 
supervision. Gove rnmen t leadership o f the development agenda and strategic choices has meant 
stronger coun t ry ownership. W h i l e m u c h remains t o be done, there has also been somewhat greater 
emphasis o n ha rmon iza t ion and a l ignmen t and o n designing and implementing results-based M o n i t o r i n g 
and Eva lua t ion sys tems at the onset o f projects. M o r e fundamentally, the W o r l d Bank coun t ry team i s 
highly decentralized with mos t sectors represented in D a r es Salaam. This enables the B a n k t o p l a y an 
active and on -go ing r o l e in sector d ia logue and in the p r o v i s i o n o f imp lemen ta t ion support t o operations 
in the Bank’s po r t fo l io . The B a n k shou ld continue t o focus o n inc reas ing decen t ra l iza t ion t o the Coun t ry 
O f f i c e o f b o t h s ta f f and dec is ion -mak ing powe r . 

100. 

Since December 2004, the Bank ’s coun t ry team has organized i t s e l f a round t h e th ree clusters o f 
the MKUKUTA. This has fac i l i ta ted coo rd ina t ion and synergy be tween ac t iv i t ies and across sectors, 
and has p romo ted e f fo r ts t o find the m o s t e f fec t ive and e f f ic ien t w a y f o r suppo r t ing the Government’s 
e f fo r ts t o reach the MKUKUTA goals. The Bank ’s annual business p lans and eve ry n ew proposed 
ac t iv i ty i s scrutinized against the f o l l o w i n g criteria: (i) consistency with MKUKUTA outcomes; (ii) 
e f fec t ive /e f f ic ien t approach f o r i n f l u e n c i n g MKUKUTA outcomes; (iii) realism-can WB actually 
in f luence outcomes within the p roposed timeframe; (iv) selectivity-has 
the B a n k collaborative, 
comparative, o r con t r ibu t ive advantage in a specific area; (v) cross-sector synergies/complementarities; 
and (vi) JAST consistency. T h i s approach should help t o ma in ta in a well a l igned B a n k p rog ram with 
the MKUKUTA, no tw i ths tand ing the challenges t o the Bank ’s in te rna l processes and systems.

Recurrent costfinancing. Any 

limits that wou ld apply t o t h e ove ra l l 
amount o f recurrent expenditures 
that the Bank may finance. 

N o country-

Remarks 

The Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f the 
costs o f ind iv idua l operations after considering the 
context o f these operations and po r t fo l io 
imp l ica t ions within the C A S envelope. Bank 
f inanc ing o f 100 percent o f pro jec t costs i s 
expected to app l ied selectively, p r ima r i ly in cases 
where counterpart f inanc ing requirements wou ld 
cause delays in pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion or cause 
large transaction costs re la t ive t o ove ra l l project 
cost. Counterpart funding w i l l be encouraged. 
The Bank w i l l continue t o mon i to r overa l l 
medium t e r m f isca l sustainability and i t s 
imp l ica t ions fo r recurrent cost financing. In 
de term in ing Bank f inanc ing o f recurrent costs in 
ind iv idua l projects, t h e Bank w i l l take in to 
account sustainability issues at the sector and 
pro jec t levels, inc lud ing implied future budgetary 
outlays. In sectors where an use r - fee arrangement 
i s considered essential fo r sustainability e.g., 
roads, water e lec tr ic i ty , and other urban sectors, 
the Bank w i l l also take this in to account in 
determining appropriateness and leve l o f recurrent 
cost financing. 
The two requirements are met. The Bank may 
finance loca l cost in the p ropo r t ion needed in 
ind iv idua l projects. 

Y e s 

Loca l costfinancing. Are the 

requirements fo r Bank f inanc ing o f 
loca l expenditures met, name ly that: 
(i) f inanc ing requirements fo r the 
country’s development program 
wou ld exceed the pub l ic sector’s 
own resources (e.g., f r om taxa t ion 
and other revenues) and expected 
domestic borrow ing ; and (ii) the 
f inanc ing o f fore ign expenditures 
alone wou ld no t enable the Bank t o 
assist in the f inanc ing o f ind iv idua l 
projects. 

Taxes and duties. Are the re any 

taxes and duties that the Bank w o u l d 
no t finance? 

None 

Taxes or duties are judged t o be reasonable. A t the 
project-level, t h e Bank wou ld consider whether 
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high 
share o f projects costs.

Annex M: Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) 

Tanzania: External Debt S ~ s t a in ab i l i t y ~ 

Tanzania’s external debt sustainability has strengthened further following completion o f the 
Mu l t i la te ra l Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). T h e deb t r e l i e f p r o v i d e d during 2006 by the IMF, W o r l d 
B a n k (IDA) a n d A f r i c a n D e v e l o pm e n t B a n k u n d e r t h e MDRI ( i n c l u d i n g HIPC) amoun ted t o abou t 
U S $ 4 . 9 b i l l i o n , equ iva len t t o a round 60 pe rcen t o f Tanzan ia ’s t o t a l e x t e r n a l deb t s tock a t end -2005 . As a 
resu l t , the NPV o f ex te rna l deb t has dec l ined t o a round 15.5 percen t o f G D P and 6 0 percen t o f exports, 
whereas deb t serv ice dec l ined t o a round 5 percen t o f expor ts o f goods and services (Tab le 1). A l l these 
ind ica to rs are s ign i f ican t ly b e l ow the ind ica t ive debt-burden thresho lds tha t app ly t o Tanzania, ind ica t ing 
l o w risk o f deb t d i ~ t r e s s . ~ 

The baseline scenario assumes that Tanzania’s performance during the recent past w i l l be sustained 
(Tab le 2). In pa r t icu la r , i t assumes somewha t h ighe r r e a l GDP, and slightly h ighe r leve ls o f dono r assistance 
and FDI re la t ive t o the average o f the pas t 10 years, re f lec t ing s t rong ove ra l l ra t ings o f Tanzania’s 
mac roeconom ic po l ic ies , as w e l l as ongo ing s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms in key areas. 

The bound tests indicate that Tanzania’s external debt w i l l remain sustainable under the individual 
standardized shocks and their Combination (Tab le 2). Given tha t Tanzan ia does n o t breach any o f the 
ind ica t ive thresho lds f o r low - income coun t ry DSA in any scenario or b o u n d test, s t a f f c lass i f ies Tanzan ia as 
“ l ow r i s k ” acco rd ing t o the Fund -Bank i n t e r im gu idance f o r debt distress  assessment^.^ Howeve r , Tanzania’s 
ex te rna l deb t sus ta inab i l i ty h inges o n con t inued f inanc ing o f i t s s ign i f ican t cu r ren t accoun t d e f i c i t at highly 
concessional terms. Curren t ly , to ta l dono r assistance amounts t o abou t 10.6 percen t o f GDP , o f w h i c h about 
4 percen t o f G D P i s in the f o r m o f grants, and the rema inder has a gran t e lemen t o f abou t 50 percent. As 
shown in Tab le 2, f o r example, even a 2 percentage p o i n t increase in the in teres t ra te o n new bo r row ing , 
w h i l e leav ing unchanged the l o n g grace and m a t u r i t y periods, and the s ign i f ican t amoun t o f ex terna l grants 
assumed under the baseline, w o u l d g radua l ly increase Tanzania’s N P V - t o -GD P r a t i o t o abou t 25 percen t o f 
G D P by 2021 and keep i t at tha t l e v e l th rough 2026 . Fur thermore , if the share o f grants t o GDP were to 
dec l ine by o n l y 2 percentage po in ts , with the gap h a v i n g t o be f inanced at comme rc ia l t e rm s , Tanzan ia 
w o u l d breach the ind ica t ive ex te rna l debt thresho lds towa rds the end o f the p r o j e c t i o n pe r iod . 

This DSA was prepared by the s ta f f o f the In terna t iona l Mone tary Fund according t o t h e Interim Guidance fo r 
Deb t-Sus ta inab i l i ty Assessmen ts in low- Income Countries ( L IC DSA) (See BUFF/05/69, SM/04/27, 
SM/04/118 and SM/05/109 fo r details). The DSA scenarios assume r e l i e f in HIPC-comparable terms fo r a l l 
creditors with wh ich the re are pending agreements. See Table 10 o f the S ta f f Repor t . 
Acco rd ing to the W o r l d Bank’s Coun t ry Po l icy and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment Index, Tanzania i s classified as a 
“strong performer”. I t s thresholds therefore are: 50 percent o f N P V o f debt-to-GDP ratio, 200 percent o f 
N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent o f debt service-to-exports ra t io . 
The latest DSA (see EBS/05/108, Appendix V) considered Tanzania’s external debt r i s k s to be “moderate”. This 
reduc t ion in r i s k s reflects imp lemen ta t ion o f the MDRI.

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing Is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same. 
Export values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline 
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels. 
Includes official and private transfers and FDI. 
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in doliar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent. 
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
