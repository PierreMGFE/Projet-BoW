EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has made remarkable progress in post-conflict reconstruction, 
social integration and state building since the end o f the 1992-95 war. The Dayton Peace Agreement, 
signed in 1995, established a complex governance s truc ture comprising the Council o f Ministers at 
the State-level government and two Entity Governments: the Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(the Federation) and Republika Srpska (the RS). An autonomous Brcko District was added to the 
structure in 1999. 

2. 
With the continued support o f the international community, the country has taken strides 
towards establishing a functioning market economy and making progress towards EU integration. 
The BH economy i s stable. Growth has averaged five percent a year since 2000 while inflation has 
remained below five percent for most o f the decade. Although the most recent data i s scarce, there i s 
some evidence o f poverty reduction, though rural areas may be lagging. Negotiations with the 
European Union (EU) on a Stabilization and Association Agreement ( S A A ) were opened in 
November 2005. Technical negotiations were completed, but the S A A has not yet been signed, 
mainly due to an impasse on police restructuring. 

3 . 
The World Bank Group has played a significant role in this development story with 
commitments totaling more than US$1.1 billion ID A credits and grants s ince 1996 and nearly 
US$250 million original commitments from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and about 
US$3 10 million in guarantees from M IGA . This constituted one o f the largest per capita assistance 
programs received by any post-conflict country. T h e vast bulk o f this support came in the 
reconstruction phase. A review carried out by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) in 2004 found 
the B H reconstruction program to be an example o f “the Bank at its best.” 

4. 
In spite o f the very substantial progress in physical reconstruction, more than a decade in 
transition reforms has been lost to the war and reconstruction e f for ts . The complex institutional and 
political environment allows for concerted political obstruction o f many reforms and frequent 
political gridlocks, which in turn have impeded rapid advances on economic reform. This has 
retarded the development o f a nationwide institutional infrastructure fully supportive o f a market 
economy and EU integration. 

5 . 
A t the time o f the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) - endorsed by the Board in 
September 2004 - the World Bank Group and other donors felt considerable optimism that BH was 
on the threshold o f a swift and significant transition from a reconstruction mode to a fully-fledged 
development partnership: a national medium-term development strategy (MTDS) had been agreed; 
discussions with the EU on further integration had begun; and there was some momentum in the 
privatization process. Hence, the CAS was centered on Development Policy Lending (DPL)’ in 
support o f public sector reform and private sector development. W h i l e some important reforms were 
achieved during the previous CAS period, with hindsight, i t i s clear that the degree o f optimism f e l t at 
the time was unwarranted. There i s now a broad consensus that the key reason for poor 
implementation o f the DPL was the lack o f political commitment to reform. However, this was also 
compounded by the fac t that some World Bank-supported programs were overly complex and 
ambitious. 

’ Formerly referred to as ‘adjustment lending’

6 . 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to focus on areas o f demonstrable 
Government commitment and capacity to deliver on development strategies and reforms. 
Identifying areas o f intervention that have unconditional ownership by a l l the Governments and 
which also have significant development impact has been, and w i l l continue to be, the key 
challenge. The Bank’s portfolio w i l l mostly comprise investment lending and, provided there i s 
political commitment in a particular area, very focused DPLs. 

7. 
A range o f interventions from across the World Bank Group w i l l be used in partnership 
with other donors and with communications to create an enabling environment fo r further reform. 
The IFC w i l l seek opportunities to offer debt and equity in support o f B H automotive, metals, 
financial and tourism sectors, while also supporting SME development and providing advisory 
services; M IGA w i l l be open to support foreign direct investment in B H through the provision o f 
political risk guarantees. 

8 . 

On the World Bank side, resources under the base case o f this CPS are programmed to 
comprise a mix o f IDA and IBRD financing. BH w i l l begin to use IBRD financing during the first 
year o f the CPS. I t i s anticipated that the country w i l l graduate from IDA resources at the end o f 
this CPS period. Project financing w i l l be blended and a total o f approximately US$50 million a 
year w i l l be available. Should progress be made towards the high case performance benchmarks, 
an incremental US$20 million per annum would be available to BH. A mid-term assessment o f the 
high case performance benchmarks w i l l be undertaken in la te 2009. 

9. 
Despite strong economic performance and a reasonably healthy portfolio, the level o f risk 
in the BH program i s substantial. The greatest internal risks to implementation o f the B H program 
are political obstruction o f economic reforms and deterioration in the quality o f the political 
dialogue. Meanwhile, local and regional political tensions risk distracting policy-makers from the 
economic reform program. 

10. 

Executive Directors may wish to consider: 

i) Whether the lessons learned from the previous CAS period have been adequately 
reflected in the CPS; 

ii) Whether the financial resources, terms and performance benchmarks are appropriately 
matched to BH’s level o f development; 

iii) Whether the program i s adequately tailored to make the best use o f World Bank Group 
resources in order to respond to BH’s needs.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Political Economy and Social Context 

1. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has a complex governance structure. S ince the Dayton 
Peace Agreement was signed in 1995, peace has been maintained in BH and the country has achieved 
remarkable progress in reconstruction and economic development. The Dayton Peace Agreement 
established a complex governance s truc ture comprising the Council o f Ministers at the State-level 
Government and two Entity Governments: the Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina (the 
Federation) and Republika Srpska (the RS). An autonomous Brcko District was added to the 
s truc ture in 1999. The Federation i s divided into ten cantons and 74 municipalities. The Republika 
Srpska i s divided into 63 municipalities (see Box 1).

2 . 

The complex institutional structure permits concerted political obstruction of reforms 
and frequent political gridlocks which, in turn, have impeded rapid advances in economic 
reforms. Despite progress in creating new State-level institutions a f te r 1995, opposing views on 
the role o f the State in BH, combined with attempts to preserve as high a degree as possible o f 
Entity autonomy, has retarded the development o f a nationwide institutional infrastructure fully 
supportive o f a market economy and EU integration. A single economic space and a common 
vision o f the country as a framework fo r guiding economic policy-making have been slow to 
emerge: i t was only in 2004 that the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), the first 
nationwide, locally conceived document o f i t s kind, was adopted. 

3 . 
There i s still a significant international presence in BH. 
BH operates under the 
supervision o f a High RepresentativeEU Special Representative to BH, supported by the Office o f 
the High Representative ( O m ) . This position was created to oversee implementation o f the civilian 

3 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY l l 

aspects o f the Dayton Peace Agreement and i t carr ies extensive powers to legislate and remove public 
o f f ic ia ls . The High Representative i s supervised by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), 
comprising representatives o f countries and agencies that support the peace process in different 
ways. A contingent o f EUFOR troops continues to oversee the security situation, and while concerns 
over personal security have greatly diminished, societal divisions persist. During the national 
elections in 2006 nationalist rhetoric increased, further compounding the reform gridlock. 

4. 
Negotiations with the EU on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA ) were 
opened in 2005; the technical negotiations have been completed, but the Agreement has not yet 
been signed. The SAA has been held back mainly by a lack o f agreement on police restructuring, the 
last remaining major benchmark to be met (although reform o f public broadcasting and full 
cooperation with the ICTY are also needed for the signing o f the SAA, see Annex 5 ) . The October 
2007 PIC concluded that the lack o f progress with the SAA-required reforms i s a grave 
disappointment and a source o f concern for the international community. However, they welcomed 
the Mostar Declaration* o f October 28, 2007 as a starting point fo r a positive reengagement o f the 
government coalition parties. 

5 . 

Joining the EU remains a key goal for BH, but governance reform i s needed. 
Accelerating the EU integration process - something public opinion polls indicate the majority o f the 
population supports - would require a renewed government willingness to address problem areas, 
including vested interests that reap benefits from the rigidities and complexities o f the multilayered 
government structure. An attempt to reform the constitution in April 2006 was not successful. The 
fragile consensus for reform broke down between those who prefer incremental changes to the status 
quo, no matter how modest, and those who prefer a more radical restructuring. T h e prospects for a 
new constitutional agreement are uncertain in the current political climate. 

6. 
I n addition to internal factors, the political climate i n BH during the past year has 
been affected by regional developments. Discussion o f the potential links between the resolution 
o f the status o f Kosovo and o f the integrity o f BH as a sovereign nation has had a negative effect 
on the political environment in B H and has increased opposition to strengthening o f State-level 
institutions. Calls have been made in the RS for a referendum on self-determination. 

7 . 
However, even in the current environment, progress on key reforms i s possible and 
necessary. The October 2007 signing o f a Platform for Action (Annex 1) on key s truc tura l reforms 
that could help boost BH economy’s potential i s encouraging. The Platform for Action aims at 
accelerating the implementation o f urgent reforms to attract investment, accelerate job creation and 
improve living standards in the country. The signatories agreed that urgent economic reform 
cannot be put on hold until major political disputes are resolved. I t supports actions to: (i) improve 
f i s c a l coordination and stability; (ii) create a more conducive business environment; and, (iii) 
promote other reforms that ensure sustainable development. A successful and swift implementation 
o f these commitments would be in the interest o f a l l B H citizens. 

On October 28, 2007, the leaders o f the six main parties met in Mostar and agreed on the general principles that could support a 
positive move forward on t h e pending S A A agenda

B. Recent Economic Developments and Outstanding Challenges 

Output, inflation and employment 

8. 

BH has made substantial progress in economic reconstruction since the end of the war 
and economic expansion has remained robust. Driven in large part by a jump in international 
metal prices, ear l ier reforms, new metal-processing capacity and significant remittance inflows, 
economic expansion has remained robust over the last few years. Real GDP growth, which has 
averaged five percent a year since 2000 i s likely to r i s e to about six percent in 2007 , helping return 
the level o f GDP to near its pre-war leveL3 A lot more remains to be done, however, to crea te 
conditions for sustained growth and to reduce risks to hard-won f i s c a l stability. 

9 . 
Inflation has remained low i n general. Anchored in the currency board arrangement, 
inflation i s set to average two percent in 2007 , after a one-off surge to 7 .5 percent in 2006 as a 
consequence o f the introduction o f the Value Added Tax (VAT). 

10. 
Forma l employment i s low, but i s now rising. After several years o f labor shedding, 
hiring has increased and overall employment i s reported to have risen five percent in 2006 . 
Unemployment has eased to 29 percent in early 2007 from 3 1 percent in 2 0 0 6 . Sustained 
improvements in employment w i l l require structural changes in the pattern o f productive activity. 

Ex terna l developments 

11. 
The current account deficit remains large and represents a key macroeconomic 
challenge, despite evidence that the shortfall i s smaller than officially estimated. The officially 
estimated current account deficit narrowed from about 2 0 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 10.7 percent 
o f GDP in 2006 due to across-the-board export growth and improved statistical reporting. 
Preliminary data suggest that the external shortfall i s set to widen again in 2007 to as much as 
17 percent o f GDP. However, there i s substantial evidence that the current account deficit may be 
much smaller than i s officially estimated due to the underestimation o f remittance inflows and 
other current transfers. 

12 . Net capital inflows have consistently exceeded the current account deficit, boosting 
foreign exchange reserves. Reserves rose to U S $ 3 . 5 billion as o f the end o f September 2007 (or 
5.2 months’ worth o f import cover). Foreign direct investment inflows also rose to about 
1 1 percent o f GDP in 2007 , reflecting substantial progress on privatization in the RS. 

13 . BH’s gross external debt fell from 60.3 percent o f GDP in 2003 to about 50 percent o f 
GDP in late 2007, thanks t o a rap id reduction in public external indebtedness. Public external 
debt amounted to just below one-half o f total external debt and i s dominated by obligations to 
multilateral and bilateral creditors. The World Bank i s the country’s largest single creditor with 
outstanding debt balance o f US$1 .4 billion as o f the end o f June 2007 - equivalent to 10.3 percent 
o f GDP. BH’s World Bank debt accounted for about 20 .5 percent o f the country’s overall external 
debt. Mo re than one-half o f BH’s external debt i s denominated in Euros and about one-half o f 
external debt i s contracted at floating interest rates, resulting in substantial exposure to changing 
global market conditions. 

The statistics agency has revised national accounts data to reflect some o f the sizable non-observed economy (NOE), bringing B H in 
line with most other countries i n the region. As a result o f adjustments in 2005 and 2006, nominal GDP i s now larger by about 17 
percent. Third-party estimates o f the NOE i n B H suggest that i t may be as large as 40-50 percent o f GDP.

Progress in fiscal consolidation has been substantial since the fiscal deficit peaked in 
1999, but Government spending i s s t i l l high. The genera l governmen t d e f i c i t was reduced f r om 

about six percen t in 1999 to two percen t in 2004, be fore shifting t o a surplus o f abou t three percent 

in 2006. T h r o u g h mid-2007, the genera l governmen t surplus amoun ted t o abou t f o u r percent o f

GDP. Budget revisions in both Entities should bring the general government outcome to near 
balance for 2007 as a whole. Fiscal consolidation since 1999 has been accompanied by a reduction 
in the s ize o f government, with general government spending down from about 5 1 percent o f GDP 
in 2003 to about 44percent in 2006. Nonetheless, the government burden on the economy 
expressed as a percentage o f GDP i s 4-5 percent higher than that o f countries with similar levels o f 
per capita income. 

15 . Government debt i s low, amounting to about 20 percent o f GDP in late 2007, down 
from about 24 percent in 2004. Even a f te r the planned issuance o f government bonds to finance 
the settlement o f domestic claims, government debt should remain limited to about 42 percent o f 
GDP by 201 1 and be substantially lower in N e t Present Value (NPV) terms (about 3 5 percent o f 
GDP)4 reflecting the fact that the newly issued debt w i l l be highly concessional, as i s a substantial 
share o f the existing government obligations. 

S t ruc tu ra l Reforms 

16. 
Some structural reform has been undertaken in BH. Reforms o f the financial sector, 
trade policy and public f inance have advanced reasonably well. 
In public finance, key 
accomplishments to date include successful harmonization o f indirect taxation, culminating in the 
establishment o f the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) at the beginning o f 2004 and the introduction o f 
a state-wide single-rate VAT from the start o f 2006. Modernized and harmonized corporate 
income tax (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) laws were enacted in 2006 in the RS and in late 
2007 in the Federation, setting the respective CIT rate at 10 percent and the PIT ra tes at 10 percent 
and 1 5 percent, a major improvement over previous legislation. 

17 . 

However, implementation of other key reforms has been slow and uneven. The 
National Fiscal Council (NFC), comprising the presiding member o f the B H Council o f Ministers 
and the tw o Entity Prime Ministers, was formally established in 2005; a draft law was recently 
agreed after substantial delays. However, the NFC i s not yet functional. Enacting the law w i l l be a 
crucial step toward ensuring effective coordination o f the setting, executing and monitoring o f 
f i s c a l policy in BH. Progress in advancing non-bank privatization and other corporate restructuring 
has also been slow, particularly in the Federation. 

C . Poverty Profile 

18 . 
About 18 percent o f the population lives in poverty, according to the most recent data 
available.' About 80 percent o f the poor live in rural areas and many o f the poor are in large 
households. The heads o f poor households tend to be among the least educated and are typically 
inactive or unemployed. The overall poverty numbers conceal movements into and out o f poverty 
and differences in the evolution o f poverty rates a t disaggregated levels. The poverty headcount 
was reduced only slightly between 2001 and 2004, although many individuals moved both into and 
out of poverty. These movements reflect outcomes in the labor market and wage developments. 
Many workers who moved out o f poverty also moved from inactivity or unemployment into 
employment. 

' These domestic claims were accumulated as a result o f the 1992-95 war and t h e fiscal pressures i n i t s wake. The claims are composed 
o f three groups: government spending arrears (almost fu l ly repaid), liabilities for frozen currency deposits and liabilities for war 
damages. After settling i n cash a small portion o f the deposits upon verification, t h e authorities plan to settle the remaining claims for 
such deposits by issuing bonds i n 2008 with maturity o f nine years and a fixed interest rate o f 2.5 percent. The claims for war claims are 
planned to be settled with bonds with longer-tern to be issued in 2009. Current legislation in the RS allows for maturities up to 3 5 
years, grace period o f 25 years and an interest rate o f I .5 percent. In the Federation, the grace period i s 13 years and the interest rate 1 . 5 
percent 
The most recent data on poverty i s from the 2004 L iv ing Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS).

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYOI-FYI1 

19. M an y households remain vulnerable to the risk o f falling into poverty, o r are “nearly 
poor.”6 Among those who moved out o f poverty between 2001 and 2004, about 70 percent may be 
considered “nearly poor” and vulnerable to falling back into poverty. 

20. 
Employment remains a key determinant o f poverty. The 2006 Labor Force Survey 
suggests that informality i s associated with lower average (and more unequal) earnings. In addition, 
joblessness i s associated with worse welfare outcomes. Among working-age individuals, those who 
are jobless account for the largest share o f the poor and face the highest poverty risks. Joblessness 
i s the highest among the young, women, the relatively less educated workers and workers over 40 
years o f age. Qualitative research suggests that subsistence agriculture and remittances from 
abroad continue to play a role in many ru ra l households’ coping strategies. 

21. Wh i le gender equality and women’s rights are included in law, the situation o f women 
i n BH remains o f concern. In rural areas, traditional gender roles have resulted in limited access 
for women to productive resources, such as land. Employment remains difficult and women’s 
participation in the labor market continues to be low compared with men. Many women are not 
covered by health insurance. Provisions to guarantee women equal pay are i n place but they are not 
consistently applied. Women continue to be under-represented in politics and official authorities7. 

22. 
There are 17 officially recognized minorities in BH, but the law on the Protection o f 
Ethnic Minorities continues to be poorly applied. The Roma continue to be the most vulnerable 
minority and discrimination against this community persists, with problems in access to housing, 
social services, education and employment’. 

23. 
The Bank’s understanding o f poverty and well-being after 2004 i s constrained by the 
lack o f data. 
Information on household consumption was collected during the 2001 and 2004 
L iv ing Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS). For 2004, data on household expenditure i s also 
available from the Household Budget Survey (HBS). Da ta from the la tes t HBS (2007) w i l l be 
available only in 2008. Further, a l l survey data collection efforts are constrained by the lack o f a 
recent population census. The most recent census was taken in 1991 and a new one i s urgently 
needed. The government i s considering launching preparation for a new census in the near future. 

24. 
Though still substantial, i t i s likely that poverty has fallen since 2004. 
Da ta that 
supports such an inference includes: strong rea l GDP growth, robust increases in r e a l wages and 
pensions, and a robust increase in employment o f la te . Moreover, informality appears to have been 
reduced following the introduction o f the V A T and helped by robust lending by foreign-owned 
banks. 

25. 
The Bank w i l l continue to support B H in its efforts to achieve the MDGs. The 
s ta t is t ics that measure BH’s progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have 
not been updated since 2005, although the picture can be supplemented from other data sources 
(see Annex 8). The data available shows a positive trend across measured MDG indicators. I t also 
shows that B H i s well advanced towards meeting the MDG goals. The Bank w i l l focus i t s 
interventions on the reduction o f poverty, which i s s t i l l the largest problem area for BH in relation 
to the MDGs. As poverty in BH i s strongly correlated with lack o f employment, the Bank’s focus 
i s on poverty elimination through economic growth and job creation. Finally, the Bank w i l l

continue to advocate improvements in means-testing o f social programs to help reduce poverty 
through increased efficiency o f government spending. 

D. Med ium Te rm Outlook 

26. 
The ‘baseline’ case scenario over the CPS period assumes only modestly ambitious 
structural and fiscal reforms and slower growth. BH could achieve sustained strong growth in 
output and employment over the medium term provided key reforms are advanced further and 
vulnerabilities are tackled. However if, as anticipated, reforms proceed at a more modest pace, 
consistent with recent experience, growth w i l l ultimately slow down from the robust pace observed 
in 2006 and 2007. The ‘baseline’ scenario assumes only modestly ambitious s truc tura l and f isca l 
reforms, continued adherence to the currency board arrangement and improvements in regional 
stability. 

27. 
Rea l GDP growth i s projected t o accelerate to 6.5 percent in 2008, but slow thereafter 
(Table 1). GDP growth i s expected to r i s e briefly as substantial new metal processing capacity i s 
introduced and as a r e s u l t o f structural reforms carried out ear l ier . After 2008, growth i s projected 
to ease to about 4-4.5 percent a year by 2010 and 201 1 - under the assumption o f modest reform 
efforts. The longer-term growth rate under the baseline case scenario r e f l e c t s continued increases 
i n employment at the rate o f 2 percent a year, slower than in recent years. Consumer price inflation 
i s assumed to average about 2 percent i n 2007, thanks to the currency board arrangement. 

28. 
The current account deficit i s expected to remain large and continue to represent an 
important vulnerability. After rising to about 17 percent o f GDP in 2007, the officially-estimated 
current account deficit i s projected to narrow to about 13 percent o f GDP by the end o f the CPS 
period. Inflows o f foreign direct investment are expected to peak at about 11 percent o f GDP in 
2007 and 2008, reflecting privatization receipts and, thereafter, average about 5 percent a year. 
Inflows o f foreign direct investment and capital grants (included in the capital and f inanc ia l 
account, and not in the current account) should finance more than one half o f the deficit. These 
inflows, together with continued reflows o f resident capital should help l im i t re l iance on foreign 
borrowing. 

29. 
The general government balance i s assumed to shift from equilibrium in 2007 to a 
modest deficit o f about 2 percent o f GDP by the end o f the CPS period, reflecting a decline in 
grants and a growth in expenditures. Capital expenditures are se t to rise in line with government 
plans to boost infrastructure outlays but these w i l l be constrained by the ability to secure financing. 
Over the CPS period, i t i s projected that the f i s c a l deficit w i l l be financed largely through net 
domestic borrowing, draw-downs o f government deposits and privatization receipts. Privatization 
receipts are projected to amount to about EUR 1 billion in 2008 (about 8.7 percent o f GDP), 
assuming enterprise sales in the Federation proceed as plannedg. 

30 . 
The baseline scenario assumes a fiscally responsible resolution o f the large amount o f 
domestic claims, reflecting substantial efforts made to date. Domestic claims have an estimated 
face value o f about 16 percent o f 2007 GDP. The current size o f domestic claims compares well 
with much larger estimates from 2004. Some o f these estimates amounted to as much as 200 
percent o f GDP, reflecting lack o f clarity about many o f the claims. I n addition to these claims, the 
authorities w i l l need to tackle property restitution. The amount o f restitution claims i s substantial, 
and the authorities are working on a comprehensive strategy for dealing with property restitution. 
Nonetheless, risks remain that political pressures w i l l lead to a fiscally unaffordable settlement. 

Significant revenues from privatization were received in Republika Srpska during 2007 

9 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F Y 0 6 F Y I I 

31 . 
Pre-war arrears amounting to EUR 48.8 million at the end o f October 2007, owed to 
the I F C by two government-owned companies, have been transferred to the B H authorities. 
Resolution o f these arrears has been elusive for some years. The authorities have recently agreed 
to renew and advance their discussions with the IFC on ways to resolve this issue in a manner 
agreeable to both parties. I t i s fully expected that B H w i l l make progress on this expeditiously. 

E. External Financing Requirements 

32. 
The external debt burden i s projected to ease moderately under the baseline scenario, 
but the debt service will worsen after the CPS period as external financing shifts further to 
non-concessional sources. The face value o f external debt i s projected to remain close to, but 
below, 50 percent o f GDP throughout the CPS period. The Net Present Value (NPV) o f external 
debt i s set to f a l l from 47 percent in 2005 to about 40 percent by 2008, but r i s e thereafter to about 
43 percent by 201 1, as borrowing on concessional terms f a l l s sharply. Debt service ratios are 
projected to improve through 20 10 before worsening thereafter, as the share o f concessional debt i s 
reduced. 

3 3 . 
Financing requirements are projected to decline as a percentage o f GDP over the CPS 
period, but r i s e modestly thereafter. The evolution o f financing requirements reflects the 
narrowing o f the current account deficit and the assumed shift in foreign borrowing from 
concessional to market terms (Table 2)." The balance o f payments projections imply that financing 
requirements w i l l ease from 18.3 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 11 .5 percent by 2012 but rise modestly 
to 12.2% by 2016, reflecting the shift in foreign borrowing from concessional to market terms. 

F. Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Assessment 

34. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina has established, but generally not implemented, modern 
public financial management institutions and systems. The State and both Entities have laid the 
foundation for sound public financial management, including independent external audits. The 
reforms have been characterized by growing domestic ownership, particularly the finance 
ministries' efforts to improve the planning and execution o f government budgets. However, many 
o f the improvements that have been enshrined in laws and institutional arrangements still need to 
be implemented in practice. 

3 5 . 
Fiscal policy remains fragmented between the State, the two Entities and Brcko 
District. While agreement has been reached recently on a law that sets the stage for f isca l 
coordination, the law has not yet been implemented. A functional, intergovernmental National 
Fiscal Council (NFC) that can make timely and binding decisions on f i s c a l policy w i l l be critical to 
overcoming the current fragmentation o f f isca l policy-making. The creation o f a unified indirect 
taxation system i s a positive development, despite disagreements over the revenue-sharing formula 
between the Entities and Brcko District. 

36 . 
Strategic planning and budgeting has improved and ownership i s more evident. I t i s 
hoped that the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) can be sustained without external 
support and there are indications that i t i s becoming the starting point for preparation o f annual 
budgets. Preliminary steps have been taken toward a program-based budgeting process. 
Significant institutional reforms have been introduced by the State and Entity governments to 
improve organic budget laws. In addition, an intergovernmental Budget Coordination Board has 

In Financing requirements are defined as t h e sum o f the current account deficit including both current and capital transfers, principal 
repayments due and the change i n foreign exchange reserves. 

10 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08 -FY I1 

been formed for coordinating medium-term budget development among the governments including 
aligning macro-fiscal assumptions. 

37. 
An automated treasury system at the State level and in the t w o Entities has improved 
budget controls, but does not include extra-budgetary funds. The treasury system has 
improved controls, brought discipline to the budget execution system, improved overall cash 
management and improved the availability and quality o f f inanc ia l reporting. I t i s important that 
extra-budgetary funds (particularly health insurance and pension funds) and municipalities are also 
brought into the treasury system, because these bodies manage significant resources. 

3 8 . 

A country-wide L aw on Public Procurement (LPP) came into fo r c e in January 2005, 
but i s not being implemented consistently. The new law i s in line with EU requirements and i f 
implemented, would provide the basis for the Bank to use the country's own procurement systems. 
However, i t i s not yet being consistently and effectively implemented a t the State or Entity levels. 
The Supreme Audit Institution o f the State has reported several instances o f violation o f the LPP in 
i t s respective audit reports. For these reasons, the LPP i s not yet acceptable for use under World 
Bank-financed projects. However, improvements in implementation o f the law are supported by 
various donors and monitored closely by the country fiduciary team.

II. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND I S S U E S 

A. Country Priorities 

39. 
The B H authorities’ MTDS fo r 2004-2007 had three goals: a) create the conditions for 
sustainable and balanced economic development and restore partial creditworthiness on the 
international capital markets; b) reduce poverty by 20 percent, and c) accelerate E U 
integration. The strategy emphasized the inter-relationship between these objectives and aimed to 
transition BH from a largely aid-dependent economy to one that i s self-sustaining. A mid-term 
progress report and revised strategy was approved in September 2006. The Revised MTDS retained 
the three main goals o f the original strategy, but introduced greater prioritization o f measures with the 
intention o f improving implementation. 

40. 
The MTDS presented a bold reform agenda, but was not fully implemented. Legislation 
in the Entities has, at times, run counter to the strategic goals set out in the MTDS, raising questions 
about the fu l l political ownership o f the main tenets o f the strategy. Further, the MTDS was never 
fully linked to annual budgets, the MTEF or Public Investment Plans (PIP). 

4 1 . 

A new Country Development Strategy for the period 2008-13 i s currently under 
preparation in BH . 
T h e process i s being led by the Coordination Board for Economic 
Development and EU Integration, but i s currently s t i l l in i t s early stages and may not be completed 
until late 2008. Early indications suggest that the three overarching policy goals w i l l remain the same 
as those in the MTDS. 

42. 
I n the meantime, the Bank’s team has been in close and regular discussion with the B H 
authorities on their priorities. Shortly a f ter the October 2006 elections, the Bank prepared a series 
o f Policy Notes for the incoming Governments outlining: the Bank’s assessment o f progress in 
reconstruction and development, remaining challenges and areas o f vulnerability and, policy 
recommendations covering 10 key sectors. 

43. 
The dialogue with the Government on the Policy Notes and the Entity Governments’ 
investment programs was used as a vehicle for expressions o f interest in future World Bank 
support. The Bank was requested to put an increased focus on investment projects. Priority sectors 
highlighted for investments were: infrastructure (especially transport and energy); agriculture; 
development o f small and medium size enterprises; and, corporate restructuring o f enterprises. Other 
priority areas emphasized include strengthening o f the single economic space in BH, increasing 
employment, development o f local government, restructuring the economy, 
improving the 
management o f loss-making companies and harmonization with European legislation. 

44 . 

I n October 2007, the State and Entity Governments, as well as the Mayor o f Brcko 
District, identified their economic policy reform priorities with the signing o f a Platform for 
Action (see Annex 1). The proposed CPS program i s closely attuned to these priorities. 

B. Sectoral Issues 

Business Environment 

45. 
Some progress has been made in improving the business climate, but B H lags behind 
its regional neighbors. Progress through the las t CAS period includes facilitating access to 
finance and strengthening the legal framework for non-banking f inanc ia l institutions, improving 
the efficiency and effectiveness o f the business inspection regime and introducing a new business 

12 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY l l 

registration system. However, the degree o f private sector activity i s below regional averages and 
accounts for only about 5 5 percent o f GDP. The World Bank’s Doing Business reports show that 
BH’s relative ranking in terms o f ease o f doing business has been falling”. Creating an investor- 
friendly business environment w i l l be the key for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and 
strengthening growth. A Strategy and Action Plan to enhance corporate f inanc ia l reporting in l i n e 
with the EU standards and in terna t iona l good practice has been approved and now needs to be 
implemented. 

46. 
Several obstacles to an attractive investment climate remain. Key challenges include: 
reducing the time i t takes to register a new business; improving the corporate sector’s financial 
reporting, auditing and accounting standards; reviewing and rationalizing the different taxes and 
levies imposed on businesses by various levels o f government; integrating banking supervision (the 
Bank recommends fu l l unification at the national level); and, reducing the regulatory burden on 
businesses. Stronger and better regulated capital markets and better corporate governance are also 
needed. 

Infrastructure 

47. 
Infrastructure improvements are critically needed: transport and energy have been 
singled out as key priorities f o r BH by the authorities. The stock o f infrastructure in BH, 
outdated at the time i t became a sovereign country, was extensively damaged during the war. Post- 
war reconstruction was, to a large extent, focused on restoring electricity generating capacities, 
roads, schools, bridges and other key infrastructure. The authorities have identified improvements 
in infrastructure and movement towards EU standards as high priority areas where the Bank can 
provide significant support. Two key sub-sectors have been singled out - transport and energy. 

Transport 

48 . 
Demand f o r most modes of transport i s growing rapidly, consistent w ith GDP growth. 
Road traffic in and around the major urban areas i s currently rising by five percent a year, 
increasing congestion and pollution while worsening road safety. On the railways, heavy freight 
volumes are projected to increase markedly through the medium term, but passenger volumes are 
broadly static. Growth projections on the inland water transport system are modest and dependent 
on investment to return the system to navigability. 

49 . 

Transport networks need to be rehabilitated and extended, supported by a national 
transport strategy and backed by private financing. About 40 percent o f the main and regional 
road networks remain in poor condition and the current allocation for maintenance remains 
inadequate. The development o f Corridor Vc (part o f the Trans-European Network) i s considered a 
national priority and the authorities have begun to implement key sections o f the project. The Bank 
believes that a National Policy and Strategy fo r transport i s needed to ensure that investments are 
made with regard for the f i s c a l envelope. Given the scale o f the project and f isca l constraints, 
private sector capital w i l l be required in some form o f public-private partnership (PPP), requiring 
prior improvements in the institutional framework. 

Energy 

50. 
Power sector rehabilitation i s partially complete, but needs further investment. BH’s 
power f a c i l i t i e s have largely been restored s ince the end o f the war and the power sector i s being 
restructured to reduce the outstanding inefficiencies and to comply with EU regulations (designed 

” Doing Business 2008-BH ranks 105’ in the 178-country Ease o f Doing Business global rating. In Doing Business 2007 BH’s rating 
was 95/105 countries.

to promote a unified, competitive, regional electricity market based on f r e e and equal access to a l l 
participants). Nevertheless, there are s t i l l some power system facilities damaged during the war 
that have yet to be rehabilitated and the authorities project continuing large investment needs 
because o f aging facilities. B H i s part o f the South East Europe Energy Community. 

5 1 . 
Investment in new power facilities i s needed, supported by a national energy sector 
strategy and backed by private financing. There have been no significant investments in new 
power system f a c i l i t i e s in B H s i n c e the war. The authorities recognize that the investments needed 
to harness the substantial and relatively diversified energy resource base in BH to expand power 
generation capacity to meet growing domestic and regional demand may be larger than can be 
covered with traditional donor-financed projects. Recognizing f i s c a l constraints, the authorities 
have launched a comprehensive energy sector study at the State level to inform the preparation o f a 
BH energy sector strategy (expected completion in December 2007). The Entities have also begun 
to explore avenues for spreading risk and limiting f isca l costs through private sector participation. 
Although recent initiatives have involved some studies and a competitive process (primarily for 
some hydro-power plants), several initiatives are linked to unsolicited proposals from the private 
sector. 

Service Delivery 

52. 
Service delivery i s poor, especially i n ru ra l areas. Responsibility for service delivery l i e s 
with municipalities in BH. Having achieved a great deal in terms o f reintegrating returnees and 
internally displaced persons following the war, municipalities must now focus on service delivery. 
Almost 1.4 million people in B H do no t have running water in their household and lack regular 
waste removal services. H a l f a million people lack any sanitation service. One third o f rural 
households use water from unsafe water sources because they lack water connections. 

5 3 . BH must simultaneously reduce high public expenditure and increase the quality and 
quantity o f public serv ices . While responsibility for the delivery o f local public services rests 
with municipalities, services are delivered by loca l utility companies that operate as autonomous 
entities. Many are in a perpetual financial c r i s i s due to low collections, low ta r i f fs and lack o f 
maintenance. As a consequence, service quality and reliability are generally unsatisfactory, which 
makes consumers reluctant to pay the tariffs and the resultant lack o f revenue in turn, prevents 
maintenance and causes service to deteriorate s t i l l further. Recent I T A N A T sharing reforms 
promise to provide a l l municipalities, including poor ones, with a stable, autonomous, and 
equitable source o f funding. However, BH w i l l need tools to help municipalities enhance 
expenditure efficiency and meet minimum standards. An independent benchmarking o f municipal 
service delivery and improved monitoring capacity w i l l be necessary. A three-phase strategy w i l l : 
i) safeguard quality by focusing on rehabilitation and maintenance; ii) create the conditions for 
f inanc ia l autonomy o f utilities; and, iii) adjust t a r i f f levels after improving collections and system 
efficiency. 

54 . 
The Government has identified solid waste management capacity as a pr ior ity . The 
rapidly growing volume o f solid waste outstrips municipal utilities' ability to keep pace. Only 3 6 
percent o f households have regular waste removal services, so people burn or dump their waste 
illegally - polluting land, roadsides, and rivers thus posing a direct risk to public health. Although 
waste collected by municipalities has to be disposed in "official" dumpsites, these are generally 
open dumps rather than controlled landfills. 

14 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY l l 

Education 

5 5 . 

Inefficient education spending has resulted in unacceptably low education outcomes in 
BH . Forty percent o f students do not acquire basic skills and knowledge by the end o f fourth 
grade, while many students enrolled in costly vocational schools receive insufficient general 
education and are ill-equipped to meet the challenges o f today's labor markets. Pre-primary 
education enrollment rates are the lowest in the region. While primary education enrollment rates 
remain high at about 93 percent, BH has the lowest ra te o f net secondary enrollment ( 7 3 percent 
overall, with only 5 7 percent o f the poor attending) o f a l l 12 transition countries fo r which data are 
available. 

5 6 . Recently adopted laws on education, would have the potential to improve the 
education system, if implemented. The State Parliament has recently adopted a number o f new 
framework laws in education. The challenge now i s to implement these laws effectively. Support i s 
being provided by the European Commission for vocational education and training and the 
proposed law on the Education Agency. Two laws where l i t t l e or no international support i s being 
provided are the Law on Preschool Education and Upbringing and the Law on Higher Education. 
BH's participation in the Bologna process i s a major opportunity to improve the quality o f teaching 
and learning and rea l ize efficiency gains. 

Hea lth 

5 7 . 

Despite progress achieved since the war, health outcomes i n BH lag behind those 
found in other countries o f the region. Some key outcome indicators ra ise concerns: 
infant 
mortality i s higher than in most CEE countries; the incidence o f tuberculosis i s four times higher 
than the EU average; disability, posttraumatic stress, depression and chronic diseases rank highly 
on the burden o f diseases. Accidents and injuries are at a high level and appear to be rising. The 
incidence o f high-cost diseases o f the heart and circulatory system, stroke and cancer i s above the 
European averages. 

5 8 . 

The B H healthcare system i s fragmented and burdened w ith substantial duplication, 
excess employment and inefficient service delivery. Utilization o f primary and preventive health 
care i s substantially lower than in other countries in the region, while r e f e r r a l rates to the more 
expensive secondary and t e r t i a r y care level are high. Efforts to improve primary health care, 
resolve a large number o f cases at the primary level, and adherence to standard referral protocols 
have started. To improve hospital efficiency, B H would need to reduce a considerable number o f 
beds and adjust infrastructure and the health workforce accordingly. Controlling medical 
technology costs and quality assurance requires the authorities to consolidate expensive equipment 
into one or two tertiary hospitals while ensuring the efficiency o f the referral system. Fragmented 
drug procurement and pricing add to the existing inefficiencies and increase the opportunities for 
corruption. 

5 9 . 

The insurance benefit package, co-payment levels and purchasing power vary across 
the cantons and the Entities, leading to unequal access to care. Health care i s mainly financed 
through payroll social insurance contributions collected by the Health Insurance Funds. Collection 
has been poor due to a large informal economy, rampant evasion and substantial legal exemptions 
from contribution payments. The consequent deficits result in the accumulation o f payment arrears 
and in the implicit rationing. These financial challenges w i l l further increase as the population ages 
rapidly, and the concomitant rise in demand for high-cost treatment for chronic diseases. Inequity 
in health financing and the high share o f out-of-pocket spending raise concerns about access to 

care. 

15 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

60. 

Systematic changes in the way health care i s financed, organized and delivered are 
required to help improve health outcomes, provide access to quality care and ensure the 
financial sustainability of the health care system. I t i s recommended that BH’s health strategy 
focus on t h r e e main objectives: (i) more efficient resource collection and allocation; (ii) improved 
access to quality and efficient service delivery; (iii) improvements in governance and stewardship. 

Social Protection 

61. 

Outlays on social transfers in BH are high, but are not poverty focused. Levels o f 
soc ia l welfare and child protection are broadly in l i n e with other countries in Central and Eastern 
Europe relative to GDP. However, soc ia l transfers are not targeted to need and provide ample 
opportunities for double dipping, thus having limited impact on poverty alleviation. Further, 
coverage across the entities and sub-Entity governments varies considerably. While the number o f 
registered soc ia l welfare beneficiaries i s large, only a fraction o f those receive cash benefits. 

62 . 

Veterans’ benefits are high relative to other disability benefits, pensions and average 
wages. When transfers to veterans and survivors are added to the other social transfers, outlays are 
even higher and the poverty impact i s further reduced. The tendency o f most soc ia l protection 
benefits to gravitate toward the levels set by the veterans’ benefits i s worrying and potentially 
counterproductive. For example, the s ize o f the potential obligations accrued in the past few years 
in the Federation would require tax increases or the reduction o f under-financed welfare benefits. 

63 . 
The social welfare system in BH contains multiple programs that compete f o r scarce 
resources. I t i s recommended that the authorities start targeting benefits to need, in line with the 
proxy-means testing and conditional cash transfer parameters. Further, spelling out precise 
eligibility c r i te r ia for more than one benefit, and by strengthening an integrated beneficiary 
database to ensure effective monitoring should help reduce opportunities fo r “double dipping”. 

Agriculture 

6 4 . Wh i le agriculture contributes 10 percent o f GDP and 21 percent o f overall 
employment, 20 percent o f the people working in the natura l resources-based economy live in 
poverty. BH needs to transition from low technology agriculture towards a modern sector with 
agricultural policies and institutions, food safety and animal health requirements aligned with EU 
requirements. 

65 . 
Ru r a l productivity needs are still subject t o underdeveloped ru r a l credit markets, the 
slow land consolidation process and poor ru ra l infrastructure. Land consolidation and 
administration improvement (where property rights have been clarified and land markets are more 
fluid) could help conserve agricultural land, enforce spatial planning and avoid further urban 
encroachment. The context o f an ageing rural population and farm fragmentation i s expected to 
lead to land consolidation into larger production units and/or pull together farmers associations to 
share resources, and involve more mechanization. 

66 . 

The wa r i n BH resulted in significant population displacement as well as the loss o f 
property records so that legal records may not correspond w ith the current patterns o f land 
use. As a result, i t i s very difficult to complete basic r e a l estate transactions or to borrow money 
based on property as collateral, particularly for women who sometimes waive their property and 
inheritance rights to male family members. 

16 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08 -FY I1 

Environment 

6 7 . While there i s no national level environment strategy, B H has made progress on some 
aspects o f environmental management. The MTDS has a chapter on environment, both Entities 
are working on their own environment strategies and a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action 
Plan i s nearly complete. Legal frameworks exist for environmental protection, water resources 
management, a i r quality protection, forestry, and nature protection. There i s also a new focus on 
economic instruments for mitigation o f environmental impacts to implement ‘polluter pays’ 
principles. 

68 . However, governance challenges remain, particularly in enforcement, planning and, 
management practices. Particular attention needs to be paid to improving: sustainable forest 
management; water management practices; and management o f BH s river basins for power 
generation, irrigation, tourism, and water and waste water services. Capacity i s weak and needs to 
be further developed to harness the potential o f the country’s tourism sector, to help BH prepare for 
absorption o f possible EU pre-accession funds and to meet the EU accession requirements. 

6 9 . Disaster preparedness i s limited. The prevalence o f regional risks, such as forest fires 
earthquakes and communicable diseases have gained increasing attention on the need for disaster 
preparedness, reduction and response. BH i s improving i t s surveillance, diagnostics, and technical 
capacity to monitor and treat diseases such as Avian Influenza. 

C . Governance 

7 0 . BH’s complex governance structure makes governance reform difficult and 
commitment to reform appears to be weak. B H lags significantly behind its income group on 
three dimensions o f governance: political stability/absence o f violence, government effectiveness, 
and the quality o f regulation (see Annex 6 ) . A l l o f these dimensions are related to BH’s complex 
institutional structure, albeit not to the same degree. BH has several positive governance 
characteristics including the functioning o f the supreme audit institutions, adoption o f the new law 
on public procurement, a free and vibrant press and democratic elections. However, commitment 
to tackle the governance agenda in a comprehensive manner appears to be lacking. 

71. EU accession i s one of the key entry points f o r the Bank on governance reform in BH . 
While it i s important to address a l l dimensions o f governance, the Bank’s approach i s guided by i t s 
capacity to make a difference and a focus on i t s area o f expertise. The OHR takes the lead on 
constitutional reform issues, while donors such as USAID, OSCE, the EC, UNDP, SIDA, DFID 
and the Netherlands are involved in other aspects o f the governance agenda, such as public 
administration reform, training of journalists and the Governance Accountability Project. To move 
towards EU accession, B H w i l l need to create the European administrative space and strengthen 
government effectiveness and regulatory quality. These are the areas where the Bank intends to 
focus i t s efforts. 

72. 
The World Bank will aim to affect both supply and demand factors in governance. In 
applying the Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption strategy in BH during this CPS, the World 
Bank w i l l identify sectors where governance reforms are possible and visible so as to create a 
demonstration e f fec t , while also stimulating demand for good governance through local level 
accountability interventions, ana ly t ica l work and strategic communications. 

73 . 
The CPS includes instruments to affect the supply of governance reform. The 
performance benchmarks fo r high-case lending are directly aimed at improving the efficiency and 

17 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F YO b F Y I I 

effectiveness o f government spending. CPS benchmarks w i l l regulate the flow o f resources to 
those policy areas where strong government commitment i s demonstrated and which have the 
potential to significantly a f fec t the supply o f better governance. Programs under Pillar 1 w i l l aim 
to improve the regulatory quality dimension o f governance and Pillar 2 w i l l focus on improving 
government effectiveness and efficiency in providing services at the municipal level and managing 
public resources such as forests and the environment. Finally, the CPS r e l i e s on partnerships and 
consultations with key public officials to enhance their ownership o f these efforts. 

74. 
I n addition, the Bank will continue to facilitate the demand f o r the improvement of 
governance by engaging local communities in decision making processes. The CPS w i l l 
continue to support youth groups and other NGOs in developing an effective and strategic demand 
for improved governance. Throughout the CPS period, effective communication and media 
campaigns w i l l be launched to stimulate the demand o f citizens for better governance.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM 

A. 

Implementation o f the Last CAS and Lessons Learned 

75. 
Overall performance under the previous CAS (FYO5-07) was moderately satisfactory 
( for the full CAS Completion Report see Annex 2.) The Bank’s investment operations continued to 
have a positive impact on improving access to basic services, developing core infrastructure in 
support o f economic growth, and strengthening the f inanc ia l sector. Most o f the projected 
outcomes were fully or partially achieved during this CAS period. However, at times, Government 
commitment to structural reforms proved to be elusive. The Bank’s adjustment credits’*, based on 
MTDS-identified priorities, triggered some important reforms (see below), but the overall pace o f 
reforms was slower than expected. Several adjustment credit tranches were not disbursed and a 
programmatic DPL that was planned to account for 40 percent o f the CAS base-case lending 
program was not delivered. The complexity and aggregate level o f ambition o f Bank adjustment 
operations also contributed to this result. 

76. 
The modestly satisfactory reform performance resulted in a reduced lending program 
- between low and base case. Base case lending triggers required satisfactory macroeconomic 
performance, satisfactory MTDS implementation, satisfactory progress in improving the business 
environment, satisfactory performance towards a reformed public administration and private sector 
wage determination mechanisms, and a reduction in the public sector wage b i l l as a share o f GDP. 
These triggers were only partially and unevenly met. The base case lending envelope was projected 
at U S 1 5 2 million, but, the ac tua l lending program was U S 1 2 3 million (or 8 1 percent o f the 
projected base case). The Bank’s team demonstrated flexibility in re-allocating ID A resources to 
the sectors and operations which demonstrated capacity fo r further progress and productive use. 

77 . As o f June 30,2007, the IFC’s committed portfolio in B H amounted to US$166 million, 
of which US$27 million in equity and US$139 million in loans. During the las t CAS period, IFC 
expanded i t s program, committing US$106 million, compared to U S 6 0 million under the FY02- 
04 CAS. IFC had a number o f successful new operations over the last CAS period, including the 
provision o f funding to financial institutions to support SMEs and microfinance industry (initially 
launched and developed with support o f IDA), the promotion o f energy efficiency and the 
development o f housing finance. I t also supported a glass and chemical company to facilitate FD I 
and the transfer o f modern technology and a producer o f generic pharmaceutical products to 
increase substantially the variety o f domestically produced drugs. IFC has been following closely 
opportunities to support private sector participation in infrastructure, but slow progress on 
privatization has prevented IFC’s engagement. In addition to BH specific investments, IFC has 
also invested in one regional project and two private equity funds, which operate in Southeast 
Europe, including in BH. 

78 . 
Pre-war arrears amounting to EUR 48.8 million at the end of October 2007, owed to 
the I F C by two government-owned companies, remain outstanding. These arrears have been 
transferred to the BH authorities, but resolution o f the situation has been elusive fo r some years. 
The resolution o f arrears to IFC would allow the World Bank Group to further increase its program 
in BH through mobilizing more resources to finance private sector projects in the country as well 
strengthening i t s ca ta ly t ic role in promoting FD I in the country 

79 . M IGA ’s outstanding gross exposure in B H as of June 30, 2007 amounted to US$203 
million, equivalent to 3 .8 percent o f MIGA’s total portfolio. Over the last CAS period, M IGA 

‘ I Referred to now as Development Policy Lending (DPL) 

19 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

issued new guarantees in support o f investments in the financial sector fo r an overall gross amount 
o f about US$136 million. 

80. 
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) carried out during the previous CAS 
provide strong input fo r the current and future policy dialogue. The key pieces o f ana ly t ic 
work included: Country Economic Memorandum; Public Expenditure and Institutional Review 
(PEIR); Labor Market Update; Financial Sector Assessment Program; Debt Sustainability 
Analysis; B H Pension System Note; and Fiduciary Update. These reports, the PEIR in particular, 
triggered important policy dialogue during the previous CAS period and provide an ana ly t ic basis 
for the new CPS. 
I n addition, the Policy No tes the Bank prepared provided an opportunity to 
discuss with the newly elected governments the priorities for the next four years. 

8 1. 
I F C advisory services i n BH focused on specific programs covering four business lines: 
i) value addition to firms, improving management practices, increasing competitiveness o f loca l 
companies and improving supply-chain practices regarding the collection and re-use o f recyclable 
materials; ii) improving the business enabling environment with programs on alternative dispute 
resolution and sub-national competitiveness; iii) access to f inance with programs on housing 
finance, micro-finance and sustainable finance; and iv) infrastructure to promote private sector 
participation in a l l infrastructure sub-sectors (although slow progress on privatization prevented the 
IFC from engaging in this area). 

Box 2: IFC Alternative Dispute Resolution Project 

Alternative Dispute Resolution Project 

Since 2003, IFC Advisory Services has been implementing an Alternative Dispute Resolution 
Project (ADR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina to foster the development o f mediation in order to allow 
e f f i c i e n t and cost-effective resolution o f commercial disputes. Mediation i s an important factor in 
enhancing the business environment, as i t helps businesses to unlock capital tied up in litigation 
while reducing pressure on the courts. In order to accelerate the resolution o f commercial disputes, 
IFC established a cooperation arrangement with the Ministry o f Justice o f Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and with other institutions, organizations and development agencies, to ensure institutionalization 
o f a sustainable mediation system. IFC also helped to develop a professional cadre o f mediators, 
trained according to best international practices, and supported the growth o f the Association o f 
Mediators in Bosnia and Herzegovina (AOM). 

As a result, more then 600 cases with a success rate o f 5 5% were mediated releasing EUR 9 .5 
million in assets to parties blocked for more than three years in court procedures. Recently, IFC 
marked the completion o f successful pilot projects and transferred two fully equipped mediation 
centers in Sarajevo and Banja Luka to the AOM. In addition, IFC supported AOM i n drafting the 
law on Mediation Procedure (enacted by the Parliamentary Assembly o f BH in August 2004) and 
additional bylaws (enacted by the State Parliament in March 2006). Since July 2007, a l l necessary 
preconditions for fu l l implementation o f the mediation law are met and 3 3 certified mediators are 
offering mediation services nation-wide. 

82. 
Effectiveness delays are causing significant delays in project implementation. A l l the 
projects approved in the previous CAS period have experienced effectiveness delays due to the 
complex signing and ratification procedures o f the B H governments. However, the State-level 
Council o f Ministers recently expressed commitment to address the issue and has already taken 
actions to streamline the ratification procedure. The Bank’s Po r t fo l io Management Team in 

20 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Sarajevo i s working with counterparts in the Council o f Ministers to develop processes that should 
reduce the time between Board approval and project effectiveness to a maximum o f 4-6 months 
(from an average o f 9-10 months currently). 

83 . 

The Bank maintained a strong relationship w ith the BH Governments and its services 

are still considered highly valuable. Despite the problems encountered with DPLs, the Bank 
maintained a strong relationship with the client. The c l ien t survey, carried out in October- 
November 2006, interviewed about 250 stakeholders, two-thirds o f whom were Government 
o f f ic ia ls at different levels. A c l ien t survey indicated high level o f satisfaction with the Bank 
services (see Box 3). Clients had a favorable impression o f Bank’s effectiveness in BH, with an 
average rating o f 7.52 on a sca le from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). This compares favorably to the 
World Bank global average o f 6.4. Almost 60 percent o f respondents wanted more Bank 
involvement and only about five percent thought that the Bank should be l e s s involved than before. 
The Bank’s knowledge combined with its financial resources still seemed to be perceived as highly 
(and equally) valuable. Limited use o f local experts and bureaucratic policies and procedures were 
identified as the two greatest weaknesses. Government commitment and weak capacity were 
assessed as the most significant factors inhibiting future sustainable growth and development. 

Box 3: Wo r ld Bank Client Survey 
World Bank Client Survey for Bosnia and Herzegovina 

The Client Survey, conducted in late 2006, was followed by in-depth interviews with o f f ic ia ls and 
staff o f government ministries, parliaments and implementation agencies; bilateral and multilateral 
agencies; academic and research institutes; business and private sector organizations; NGOs and the 
media. In summary, the findings are: 
Almost a l l respondents evaluate the World Bank and its work in BH as positive, useful and 
desirable. 
They consider that the Bank has played a significant role in BH and has provided assistance 
and support to strategic development. 
The attributes most frequently ascribed to the Bank are skill, professionalism, support, 
desirability, constructiveness, technical experience, carefulness, significance, seriousness and 
importance. 
Bureaucracy, insufficient [local] exposure, bad moves and inadequate familiarity with the 
current situation in the country are some o f the criticisms o f clients. 

Lessons learned and implications for the new CPS 
84. 
Ta i lor the CPS program to the level and areas of Government commitment and 

capacity to deliver on reforms. Government capacity and commitment to reforms i s the key 
factor. While rather obvious, such a principle i s particularly relevant in BH . Identifying areas o f 
intervention that have strong ownership by the BH Governments and yet also have significant 
development impact w i l l continue to be the key challenge for this CPS. 

Improve political economy analysis when deciding about the instruments to pursue 

85 . 
development priorities. The uneven experience with DPLs and technical assistance was not due to 
a failure by the Bank or by the BH Governments to recognize the country’s main development 
challenges. On the contrary, in the design o f both, cancelled, adjustment credits (SOSAC I1 and 
EMSAC) the priorities requiring urgent tackling were clearly identified by the Governments, but 
were frustrated by political factors. However, the respective Bank teams appear to have 
overestimated the capacity o f the Government to deal with several parallel reform processes 
pursued by different international organizations. Better analysis o f the political economy should be 
applied during the preparation and implementation o f a l l projects. 

21 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

86. 
Pursue reforms through 
investment lending and, provided there i s political 
commitment, very focused DPLs. Under the previous CAS the Bank provided a combination o f 
DPL, investment loans, techn ica l assistance operations and ESW to support BH’s reform program. 
Investment operations helped move reform forward in key sectors, including health, energy, roads, 
and solid waste management. Although DPLs were less successfLI1, a measurable part o f the reform 
agenda supported by these credits was accomplished. Continued policy dialogue resulted in 
progress on several fronts. For example: in te rna l audit and procurement laws have been enacted; 
synchronized laws on internal audit were drafted; and, while the law in the RS has been enacted, 
the laws at the S ta te level and in the Federation are going through parliamentary procedures. 
Further, the RS has drafted a law on public sector salaries that aims to bring the existing supra- 
wage allowances into the base wages; to ensure effective mechanisms o f f i s c a l sustainability; and, 
to promote transparency in public wage setting. Efforts should be made in the new CPS to use 
investment operations to speed up the reform processes. A t the same time, the policy dialogue 
should continue and, should the appetite for the pace and type o f reform change, Development 
Policy Loans should feature as a part o f the high-case scenario. 

87. 
Consider project design, which rewards the best performing segments o f BH, while at 
the same time not undermining the single economic space. Recent experience suggests the need 
for greater flexibility in project design to support reforms and investments where they make the 
greatest development impact. Whereas most project funds are currently allocated to both Entities 
(in accordance with a pre-set ratio), the World Bank i s w i l l ing to explore the possibility o f 
introducing, upon request o f the authorities and in selected projects, a mechanism whereby, during 
the course o f project implementation, a portion o f the funds would be allocated to the Entity or 
beneficiary that demonstrates the strongest ability to absorb more funds and make faster progress 
towards meeting the project’s development objectives. I t should be stressed, however, that such 
performance-based flexibility would only be exercised where the approach i s acceptable to, and 
requested by, the authorities and i f i t w i l l no t undermine efforts to deepen the single economic 
space and foster soc ia l cohesion in BH. 

88 . 
Focus on results and the importance o f monitoring and evaluation beyond Bank- 
supported operations. The focus on results should clearly go beyond Bank financed operations. 
Bank teams should ass is t the Government to set up mechanisms to monitor its own performance, 
including enhancement o f the country’s overall statistical capacity. 

8 9 . Create an enabling environment for CPS implementation. The CPS requires a carefully 
tailored communication strategy that would help the Government explain the benefits o f reforms 
and the costs o f inaction. Therefore, the operations to be supported under the new CPS w i l l be 
accompanied by a communication strategy that would help the Government and the Bank to 
communicate better the potential benefits o f the proposed operations, as well as to demonstrate the 
benefits and costs o f reforms - or inaction on reform. 

90 . Continue to use AAA as the basis for policy dialogue and formulation o f the CPS 
program. During the previous CAS period, the Bank produced several important documents that 
formed a basis for CPS consultations. The PEIR and Policy No tes in particular were useful in 
informing policy dialogue. Finally, regional studies (Doing Business, Anticorruption in Transition, 
and L i f e in Transition Survey) attracted a lot o f in te res t among policy makers and opinion formers. 
These studies provide clear evidence about the trends in BH in comparison with other countries in 
the region and should continue to be used strategically to target operations and to develop domestic 
“champions” o f reforms.

B. Proposed World Bank Group Country Partnership Program for BH 

91. 
During the CPS implementation period, the World Bank Group will strive to be a 
catalyst for the inclusive and sustainable integration o f BH’s economy in Europe. Economic 
and social development in BH i s part o f the process o f EU integration. This provides the overall 
institutional and legal framework to underpin economic development and poverty reduction i n BH. 
This i s recognized in the MTDS and continues to be the overall objective o f the new Government’s 
development agenda, in spite o f the slow progress towards signing the SAA in the las t twelve 
months. Bank-supported projects w i l l aim to help B H reach their EU goal. 

92. B H will need to continue to improve the competitiveness o f its economy in support o f 
its EU objective. B H has made very substantial progress in economic reconstruction since the end 
o f the war, but compared to other transition countries, more than a decade in transition reforms has 
been lost to war and the reconstruction efforts. There i s s t i l l a large unfinished reform agenda that 
i s holding the country back on i t s goal o f convergence with South-Eastern Europe and the EU. The 
importance o f this unfinished reform process i s recognized by the B H authorities and i s reflected in 
the MTDS priorities and State and Entity investment programs. A further indication o f the 
centrality o f the structural reforms for the future o f BH i s the signing in October 2007 by the S ta te 
and Entity Prime Ministers and the Mayor o f the Brcko District, o f a jo in t Platform for Action to 
accelerate the implementation o f urgent reforms to attract investment, accelerate job creation and 
improve l iv ing standards in the country (Annex 1). 

93. 
The new CPS supports the country’s priorities by focusing on two pillars: 
(a) 
improving the environment f o r private sector-led growth and convergence with Europe; and, 
(b) improving the quality o f Government spending and the delivery o f public services fo r the 
vulnerable. Under the first pillar, the CPS strives to support the country to: (i) expand business 
activity and increase economic opportunities; (ii) improve key infrastructure; ( i i i ) strengthen 
regional cooperation to manage public goods; and, (iv) invigorate privatization and corporate 
restructuring. Under the second pillar, the CPS w i l l support the governments to: (i) improve the 
delivery o f municipal services and strengthen municipal finance; (ii) improve the quality o f social 
service delivery; ( i i i ) reduce urban-rural disparities in income; (iv) increase the targeting o f social 
benefits; and, (v) reduce the burden o f Government in the economy and strengthen f i s c a l 
coordination. Thus, the Bank Group’s program under the new CPS w i l l re ta in considerable 
continuity in view o f the previous CAS. Figure 1 illustrates the structure o f the CPS.

The Allocation of Resources 

94. While a base and high case lending scenarios w i l l be used to define the level of access 
to I B R D resources, the Government’s Coordination BoardI3 w i l l also periodically assess the 
allocation of Bank resources and update the operations program agreed between the Bank and the 
Governments o f BH. Joint annual assessments w i l l consider progress in the preceding year against 
the development objectives and results outlined in the CPS and agree priorities for the next two 
years. The program w i l l remain shaped by and within the boundaries se t by this CPS, combining 
the Government’s evolving priorities and the Bank’s corporate strategy. The timing o f these 
reviews w i l l be linked to BH’s budget cycle. 

95. 
T o maximize flexibility and to avoid some o f the pitfalls of the last CAS, the CPS 
program i s being notionally divided into a ‘core ’ and a ‘non-core’ program. The ‘core’ 
represents those activities for which political commitment on the part o f the BH authorities has 
been tested. I t i s represented by projects and programs already underway or likely to be introduced 
in the first two years o f the CPS. This includes lending projects, as well as IFC investments, 
M IGA guarantees, WBI training activities, TA assignments and A A A work. Outcome indicators 
for these activities have been developed and are se t out i n the Results Matrix in Annex 3 . Due to 
the flexible nature o f the CPS, the results matrix w i l l be further developed as the program evolves 
and w i l l be revisited in the mid-CPS Progress Report. 

96. 
The ‘non-core’ program represents interventions in areas where political commitment 
needs testing o r where a ceiling on resources w i l l prevent implementation in the early years o f 
the CPS. The ‘non-core’ program represents two types o f situation. First, those reform areas 
where the Bank Group could support B H to make progress, but where (given past experience with 
slow moving or cancelled projects) political commitment needs to be tested prior to re-engagement. 
Where possible, these important reform areas w i l l be monitored and supported with non-lending 
activities, such as TA and ESW. Second, those projects where commitment i s apparent, but where 
a ceiling on resources w i l l prevent implementation in the early years o f the CPS. Dec is ions 
regarding the prioritization o f these projects and the appropriate instruments w i l l be taken jointly 
by the World Bank and the authorities at the annual Coordination Board review o f CPS progress. 

F inanc ia l Envelope 

97. BH continues to benefit from exceptional access to I D A resources. Due to its low 
creditworthiness and despite a per capita income that exceeds the normal IDA cut-off by a large 
margin, B H has continued to receive access to ID A resources. 

98. Over the last CAS period, B H had an envelope o f SDR78 million I D A , w ith access to 
I B R D lending conditional on achieving enhanced creditworthiness. Creditworthiness was 
proxied by five performance benchmarks. During the CAS period, B H achieved some, but not a l l 
o f the performance benchmarks and, therefore did not draw any IBRD resources (see Annex 2). 

The Base Case 

99. 
The CPS spans the last year of IDA 1 4 and the 3 years o f IDA15 , during which a 
phasing out o f I D A i s expected i n B H . In the first year o f the CPS, SDR16.8 million (US$26m at 
current exchange rates) o f ID A resources are available, which i s the fu l l performance based 
allocation after taking into account front-loading o f IDA assistance in FY07. In the second year, 

” The Coordination Board comprises the three Prime Ministers and their respective Finance Ministers, plus the Mayor o f Brcko District. 

25 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

the fu l l performance based allocation would be again available to BH - which i s expected to be 
about SDR25 million (US$39 m i l l i ~ n ) ' ~ . Thereafter, BH would receive two-thirds o f its fu l l 
performance-based allocation (PBA) in FY 10 (estimated at SDR 17 million) and one-third o f the 
allocation in FY 1 1 (estimated as SDR8 million), with an expectation o f graduation from ID A at the 
end o f FY 11. 

100. Reflecting some improvement in economic performance since the last CAS, limited 
volumes of IBRD w i l l be made available to B H in the base case o f this CPS. In FY08 and 
FY09, access to IBRD would be limited to U S 3 5 million (over the two years), in FY 10 a ceiling o f 
US$24 million and in FY 1 1 a ceiling o f U S $ 3 7 million IBRD i s proposed, bringing the total 
resources available to B H in each year to roughly US$50 m i l l i ~ n ' ~ . Overall during the CPS period, 
a maximum o f US$200 million would therefore be available in the base case. 

101. To remain in the base case, B H w i l l need to demonstrate: continued satisfactory 
macroeconomic performance; satisfactory debt sustainability prospects; and no reversals of 
key economic reforms. 

The Hiah Case 

102. The high case 
re f lec ts a stronger reform environment and strengthened 
creditworthiness prospects. In addition to meeting the base case indicators, B H would need to 
take concrete steps towards the creation o f a single economic space, as evidenced by measurable 
progress in implementation o f the Platform fo r Action signed by the three Prime Ministers and the 
Mayor o f Brcko District in October 2007. In the high case lending scenario, IBRD incremental 
lending would be limited to an annual amount o f USD20 million. 

A Low Case 

103. Any serious deterioration in the base case indicators would cause the Bank to 
reconsider its levels o f support. Serious repercussions from regional political events or the 
worsening o f the political dialogue on the reform agenda would cause the Bank to review its 
lending arrangements to BH. Under a low case scenario, project preparation would proceed more 
slowly and would focus only on those parts o f the program where there i s the greatest cross- 
governmental support. 

104. Table 3 below sets out specific indicators, against which progress w i l l be assessed 
jointly (with the BH Governments) and collectively (Le. a collective assessment o f progress 
and reform momentum) to evaluate whether higher levels o f lending are justified. The 
Coordination Board w i l l undertake such an assessment annually. A mid-CPS Progress Report w i l l 
be undertaken by the Bank in partnership with the authorities in late FY09 and submitted to the 
Board. The levels o f access to IBRD w i l l be reviewed a t that point. Access to ID A would not be 
linked to these assessments; rather i t w i l l continue to be based on t h e performance based allocation 
system as described below. 

l 4 This i s t h e estimated allocation in FY09, based on performance in FY08 and assumptions about the size o f IDA IS . Actual allocations 
during the CPS period w i l l be determined on an annual basis and w i l l depend on: (i) total IDA resources available in IDA15, ( i i) the 
country's performance rating; ( i i i) the performance and ass is tance terms o f other IDA borrowers and (iv) the number o f IDA-eligible 
countries. The US$ amount w i l l also depend on the prevailing SDR:US$ exchange rate.

Lending and Analytical Program 
105. W ith in the first pillar - improving conditions fo r private sector led growth - the B H 
authorities have indicated a strong demand for a core lending program focused on 

infrastructure (in particular transport and energy). These are areas where the Bank’s program had 
strong results in the last CAS and have the potential for further development impact. In support o f 
the goal o f improving key infrastructure, the core program w i l l include on-going projects to improve 
hydropower and thermal power stations and improve access to reliable, low-cost electricity. An 
Energy Sector Study w i l l inform future potential World Bank Group supported projects in this area. 
The B H authorities are keen to receive additional World Bank Group support to put in place 
measures that would spread risks and l im i t f i s c a l costs o f establishing new power generation and 
transmission infrastructure through private sector participation; the aim o f such support would be 
on assisting the authorities to meet the Energy Community Treaty commitments, for example by 
helping put i n place transparent and competitive procedures (in accord with the relevant EU 
Directives) for solicitation, selection and authorization o f a l l new power generation and 
transmission projects. 

106. A comprehensive sector strategy w i l l drive the Bank’s engagement in transport. The 

State and Entity ministries, with support from the World Bank and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), are now developing a comprehensive transport sector 
policy and strategy framework covering aviation, roads, railways, urban transport and inland 
waterways. A new project in support o f maintenance o f roads and road safety w i l l be delivered in 
FY08. Further, the authorities have expressed considerable interest in a Sava River project which 
would include marking o f the waterway and the rehabilitation o f the port on the Sava River in Brcko 
which used to carry considerable volumes o f freight. The Bank plans to support this project in the 
early years o f the CPS. Projects supported by the EBRD, and the EIB w i l l continue to improve the 
rail infrastructure. 

27 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

107. The Bank and other donors are also assessing the possibility o f further assistance to the 
authorities’ plans to build the European Transport Co r r ido r Vc. In addition to EBRD and EIB, 
which have demonstrated readiness to finance sections o f corridor Vc, the resources used to build 
such a project should come largely from the private sector. The Bank Group and other donors may be 
able to assist with limited financing for less profitable sections o f the road, a guarantee, transaction 
advice from the IFC ando r other technical assistance. As in energy, the focus o f support to such big 
in fras truc ture projects w i l l be on ensuring that the process i s conducted in a manner that i s 
transparent, competitive and avoids the escalation o f costs. 

108. The Wo r ld Bank Group anticipates playing an 
important r o l e helping the 
Government to structure possible public private partnerships (PPP) transactions. The IFC 
w i l l continue to seek opportunities to help the Governments to s truc ture private sector participation in 
transport, energy and municipal waste treatment. Through i t s Private Enterprise Partnership in 
Southeast Europe (PEP-SE) advisory facility, IFC w i l l explore the opportunities to support PPPs 
through project preparation, structuring transparent bidding processes, and mobilization o f financing. 
M IGA can also play a role in supporting foreign direct investment in infrastructure through the 
provision o f political risk guarantees. During FY07, the Bank held a training seminar on PPPs that 
was very well attended by a cross-section o f regulators and officials from BH. Follow-up activity 
has been requested and w i l l be implemented through the CPS period. 

109. The authorities have also expressed interest in stimulating ru ra l business and 
agriculture. Under the core program, a small-scale agriculture project i s underway, which aims to 
help farmers make productivity gains through credit lines, provide assistance in forming producer 
associations and help in easing supply-chain bottlenecks. A regional Land and Gender Review w i l l 
identify the extent to which land rights are different between men and women in B H and examine 
the impact o f these differences on women’s access to land markets and any impact on family 
welfare as a result o f gender differences in land ownership. The study w i l l outline key issues 
examining the intersection between formal entitlements and actual practices with respect to gender 
and women’s access to resources for land. A land registration project which was approved in 2006 
may be a candidate for a second phase or increased financing, if i t proceeds well. 

110. Regional issues w i l l receive greater attention dur ing the CPS period. In the core program, 
the Bank supported Avian Influenza Preparedness Project, which provides critical support to 
enhance public health system infectious disease response and control capacities, i s expected to 
become effective in the first year o f the CPS. The importance o f climate change and hazard risk 
management has been brought into stark r e l i e f after significant forest f i r e s in the region during 2007. 
Mitigation and adaptation activities under a regional Southeast Europe Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Adaptation Program may form part o f the non-core program. 

11 1. The Bank i s also supporting projects on environmental protection, both to improve 
governance and transparency and to support tourism. The Forestry Development and 
Conservation Project, which promotes capacity building and governance in the sector, received 
additional financing in FY07. Environmental capacity building w i l l also be supported in the CPS 
period through the implementation o f two GEF-funded projects: Neretva and Trebisnjica 
Management Project (for the water sector), and the Forest and Mountain Protected Areas Project 
(for biodiversity conservation and tourism promotion). 

112. 
I n the corporate sector, I F C and M I G A w i l l continue to support strategic FDI in BH 
w ith a focus on encouraging regional cooperation by encouraging good and growing companies 
active in the region to invest in BH . IFC w i l l focus on investors in the commercial property and 
IFC w i l l also seek opportunities to support domestic companies, such as the 

food sectors. 

28 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08 -FY I1 

automotive, metals and tourism sectors, to become more competitive in the domestic and regional 
market. IFC focus w i l l be on post privatization support, as well as facilitation o f the transfer o f 
technology and increased competitiveness. WB I and the Bank are cooperating on joint program to 
promote private sector led-growth through innovation and technology in selected sub-sectors. IFC’s 
PEP-SE w i l l continue to be active in supporting S M E development in BH. M IGA w i l l be open to 
support FD I in the manufacturing and agribusiness sectors through the provision o f guarantees. 
M IGA w i l l also consider opportunities to promote SMEs in BH through its Small Investment 
Program. 

113. The Bank will also continue to promote reforms that aim to expand business activity 
and improve the business environment. A Business Enabling Credit that yielded several notable 
results, including improved access to finance, faster bankruptcy procedures and a more e f f i c i e n t 
inspection regime, i s due to close at the time the CPS starts and w i l l be evaluated in the first year o f 
the CPS. 
In this CPS period, an Enterprise Restructuring Grant from the European Union, 
administered by the Bank, w i l l aim to move the corporate restructuring agenda forward with a 
restructuring o f over a dozen Voucher-Privatized Enterprises and w i l l pave the way for further 
corporate restructuring. 

114. Non-lending service will also support the improvement o f the business environment. An 
Investment Climate Assessment w i l l be produced during the first year o f the CPS. Further, the Bank 
w i l l support improved corporate financial reporting and auditing in l i n e with international standards. 
Other Bank Group interventions towards this goal in the core program may include IFC advisory 
services and WBI’s capacity building and in conjunction with other development partners. WB I also 
has a program to improve the competitiveness o f the ICT sector in BH. 

1 15 . Privatization, corporate restructuring and firm exit reforms are areas where 
commitment has been mixed under previous Bank projects. W h i l e there i s strong demand for 
Bank support for corporate restructuring from some parts o f Government (the RS in particular), 
uneven performance on these reforms under the last CAS suggest that this be part o f the non-core 
program to be supported initially by training activities and ESW. Additional Bank financial support 
would be considered to support privatization or corporate restructuring if commitment to reform in 
this area i s demonstrated. 

116. The IFC will continue to be active in the financial sector, using loan and equity financing, 
as well as advisory services. 
IFC w i l l seek strategic partners to establish greenfield banks and 
support loca l financial institutions to develop into high-quality banks, while continuing to support the 
development o f microfinance, leasing, housing and energy efficiency through existing financial 
institutions. MIGA w i l l also consider opportunities to support foreign strategic investors in the 
financial sector, focusing on projects which promote the development o f specialized products, such as 
leasing, and improve SMEs’ access to finance. 
117. Under the second pillar - improving government effectiveness - the Bank will support 
efficiency improvements in agriculture. An Agriculture and Rural Development Loan, approved in 
FY07 for implementation through this CPS period, w i l l help improve the efficiency o f public 
financing for the agricultural sector under the core program by strengthening the capacity o f the 
State- and Entity-level institutions to deliver more efficient and effective agricultural services. I t 
w i l l also accelerate the country’s eligibility t o access support under the EU Instrument fo r Pre- 
Accession Assistance fo r Rural Development (PARD). 
The project w i l l also promote 
harmonization of food safety and animal health requirements to the EU acquis commun i ta i re . 
Associated farm and c l i e n t registries should allow better targeting o f subsidies. 

29 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

118. The BH authorities have indicated interest in continued investment borrowing for social 
service projects, including pension system reform, but performance in other human 
development projects has been uneven. I n the core program, the Bank has a social insurance TA 
program and an employment services project due to close soon a f ter the introduction o f the CPS. 
Education and health projects are also underway, both o f which w i l l close towards the end o f the CPS 
period. W h i l e the health project i s proceeding well, limited commitment to reform in education and 
in social protection has led to lower than anticipated development outcomes to date. Therefore, the 
Bank w i l l continue to try to influence these important parts o f BH’s soc ia l service agenda under the 
non-core program with policy dialogue and AAA. I f progress i s seen in some o f the areas listed as 
challenges in the sectoral section o f the CPS, further engagement w i l l be warranted. For example, a 
new social sector project, possibly pension reform, w i l l be considered in the outer years o f the CPS. 

119. Bank support fo r municipal development i s o f particular interest to the authorities. 
Under the core program, the Bank’s urban infrastructure project assists municipalities to improve 
service delivery. A new Municipal Development Project w i l l be introduced in the early years o f the 
CPS. A community development approach proved to be a successful instrument for investments in 
small loca l infrastructure in the poorest municipalities. IFC w i l l also seek to support local authorities 
and help them in structuring private sector participation in municipal infrastructure. However, 
institutional capacity i s weak and the legal framework i s not yet adequate to allow for private sector 
participation arrangements in public infrastructure projects at the municipal level. 

120. The Bank has been active in the solid waste sector and plans to continue in this area. 
The current Bank-supported project has established six regional landfills; safe methods o f disposal; 
public awareness; training o f sector staff; and has extended waste collection to those areas that are 
not currently serviced. However, additional bilateral funding sought from numerous donor agencies 
has not resulted in any concrete commitments. Given the financing gap and repeated and urgent 
requests by the Governments, the Bank provided additional financing to the project and has been 
requested to support further implementation o f the Nationwide Solid Waste Management Strategy 
to arrive at nationwide coverage o f the program. More financing w i l l be provided to complete the 
national coverage o f this project in the early years o f the CPS. 

121. The Bank w i l l also continue to advocate for structural reforms to improve fiscal 
coordination and improve the emciency and tracking o f public expenditure more broadly 
through non-core and non-lending activities. Further financing activities in this area would be 
considered for fields where commitment to implement the Platform for Action i s demonstrated, and, 
as opportunities to engage emerge. Strategic communications w i l l be critical to create knowledge 
and public demand for structural reform in partnership with the authorities and other donors. 

122. Capacity and coordination in the field o f statistics are weak and need urgent 
improvement. The existence o f multiple statistical agencies with weak capacity has hindered the 
effective collection and analysis of statistics. Most nationwide survey e f fo r ts since the war have been 
donor-financed. Capacity building in the area o f statistical reporting remains a focus o f the Bank’s 
poverty work, including through training undertaken in conjunction with WBI. The lack o f a census 
since 1991 presents major difficulties in establishing per capita statistics and in effectively targeting 
vulnerable groups. Should i t be decided to proceed with a new census towards the end o f this decade, 
World Bank support would be provided. 

123. Flexibility, results and partnerships are the key operating principles of the CPS. The 
political deadlock o f the last twelve months, the difficult institutional environment and the 
experience accumulated with the implementation of the previous CAS indicate that the Bank needs 
to fine tune the CPS program in relation to the level and areas o f Government interest as well as 

30 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08-FYI1 

their commitment and capacity to deliver reforms. This requires a flexible approach to the 
partnership program, a strong focus on results and close partnerships with other donors. Resources 
w i l l be channeled towards those specific policy areas or sub-sectors where reform commitment and 
an opportunity to engage exist. Additional resources may be used to top up or extend existing 
successful operations, to introduce new operations and/or to introduce DPLs.

Flexibility 

124. The customary system o f allocating Bank resources to B H has not encouraged 
flexibility. To date, most Bank loans have been made to the State o f BH and then divided 
according to a pre-determined ratio between the two Entities. Progress has been assessed 
nationwide, so that delays in preparation, effectiveness or implementation o f a project in one Entity 
have held up the project in relation to both Entities. 

125. 
I n early 2007, the authorities proposed a greater degree of flexibility i n project design. 
The flexibility proposed would allow more funds to be absorbed by the Entity or beneficiary that 
demonstrates the strongest ability to make progress towards the development objectives o f the 
project. The Bank i s open to supporting all options that support reforms and investments where 
they can make the greatest development impact, but the ultimate decision on the allocation o f funds 
in each project must l i e with the authorities. Therefore, were the authorities to request such 
performance-based flexibility, the Bank would be open to explore ways to allocate part o f 
individual project financing to Entities or beneficiaries on a performance basis provided i t w i l l not 
undermine efforts to deepen the single economic space and foster soc ia l cohesion in BH.. 

Results 

126. The proposed program of activities i s results-oriented. The program i s designed to help 
B H reach its overarching goal o f EU accession. 
I t supports the MTDS goals and those in the 
recently signed Platform for Action. A results matrix i s attached (Annex 3). To enhance results in 
individual operations the Bank has agreed to introduce flexibility in some projects (as described 
above). 

127. The Bank w i l l aim to promote monitoring and evaluation capacity building beyond its 
portfolio. Bank-supported projects w i l l seek to impact sector-wide monitoring o f results by the 
authorities. Enhancing BH’s statistical capacity i s an important element o f this approach. 
Furthermore, the Bank w i l l seek opportunities to enhance the ro le o f c iv i l society to monitor and 
evaluate the performance o f their elected officials. The CPS w i l l be monitored jointly by the Bank 
and the B H authorities on an annual basis. Findings o f the annual portfolio reviews w i l l be 
presented to the Coordination Board for review and action. 

C . Partners’ Role and Participatory Process 

128. B H still enjoys significant, albeit declining, support by development agencies. Overall, 
in 2007, support by 18 most active development agencies (excluding EIB) in B H i s expected to 
reach EUR 400 million. Areas that attract most support include private sector development, 
financial sector (including microfinance), municipal development, agriculture, and social 
protection. See donor matrix attached in Annex 4. 

129. The authorities have yet to assume fu l l leadership over donor coordination. Domestic 
capacity for donor coordination i s still weak and fragmented. However, there has been progress in 
developing adequate architecture for donor coordination following the decision to transfer donor 
coordination o f responsibilities from the Ministry o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations o f B H 
to the Ministry o f Finance and Treasury o f BH. I t i s expected that these recent activities, supported 
by DFID, w i l l build capacity o f the Government to be more pro-active in specifying i t s needs to 
donors and in guiding and monitoring the manner in which assistance i s delivered. In addition to 
this, UNDP supports development o f a Grants Resource Management System (GRMS) that should 
further strengthen Government’s capacity for donor coordination. 

32 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F YO b F Y l l 

130. Meanwhile, the Donor Coordination Forum (DCF) represents the main vehicle for 
coordination and exchange of information among donors. The DCF was established in 
December 2005 as a semi-formal platform o f information exchange among major donors in BH. 
Guided by the principles o f the Paris Declaration, the objective o f the DCF i s to enhance the 
efficiency o f the use and allocation o f o f f i c i a l development assistance in the country and thus 
secure better aid effectiveness. In 2006, the DCF secretariat conducted the first Donor Mapping 
Report for BH. This report includes past, current and future resource allocations o f the 18 largest 
donors in BH (including the Bank). Furthermore, an interactive donor mapping database was 
established thus allowing fo r regular updating o f information about donor programs in BH. 

13 1. The authorities’ over-arching goal i s EU accession and the Bank i s partnering closely 
with the EU in order to ensure that support provided by the Bank enhances the prospects of 
B H reaping the benefits o f EU accession as soon as possible. The Bank w i l l continue to 
strengthen further i t s close collaboration with the EC - particularly in pursuing public sector 
reform and reforms in the agriculture sector in accordance with the EU standards. Partnership with 
the EC and regional development banks (EBRD and EIB) in supporting investments in transport 
and energy sectors have already yielded positive results and leveraged significant volumes o f 
resources. A Joint World Bank-EU o f f ice in Brussels fac i l i ta tes coordination o f development issues 
with the EC. 

132. Cooperation with other development partners remains close and will be further 
reinforced during the CPS period. Examples o f successful partnership with development partners 
over the last CAS period include: partnership with SIDA (Sweden) in promoting Agriculture and 
Rural Development; with GTZ and SIDA in developing and implementing the Land Registration 
Project; with DFID in supporting development o f an enabling business environment; and, with 
EBRD and EIB in transport and energy. I n particular, strong cooperation with EBRDE IB w i l l be 
continued in supporting infrastructure investments. Over the CPS period, close cooperation w i l l be 
required with UNDP, USAID, the Government o f the Netherlands, and SIDA in developing a 
common front in supporting municipal development. DFID remains an important partner in 
corporate restructuring and promoting e f f i c i e n t and pro-poor public financial management, as well 
as social sector reforms in the in te res t o f the most vulnerable categories o f the population. Finally, 
the Bank w i l l continue its close collaboration with the IMF. 

Participatory Process 

133. The CPS was developed after substantial consultations with key stakeholders. 
Consultations were organized i n two phases: preliminary consultations (late 2006 - early 2007), 
and another round o f consultations conducted in September-October 2007. During the preliminary 
consultations, the Bank team obtained feedback from the outgoing and newly elected Government 
o f f ic ia ls (following the October 2006 elections). Thorough preliminary consultations were also 
conducted with key development partners through a thematic session o f the Donor Coordination 
Forum and through separate consultative meetings with the EC, EBRD, DF ID and continued 
consultations with IMF. Inputs from c iv i l soc ie ty representatives were received at the CPS 
consultation meetings and through regular interaction with the Youth Voices Group - a consultative 
body operating in association with the Country Office. 

134. Formal consultations with key Government officials were held in September 2007 at a 
Coordination Board meeting organized for this purpose in addition to continuous, informal, 
discussions. The formal discussion o f the new CPS program was based on the following: (i) key 
principles outlined in the MTDS; (ii) recently adopted development strategies o f the two Entities; 
(iii) Government’s response to the Bank’s policy notes; (iv) lessons learned from the previous 

33 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FY I1 

CAS; (v) substantial AAA work carried out during the previous CAS; and, (vi) transition to IBRD. 
Broad agreement was reached about areas o f intervention and principles that should shape future 
partnership. Following the formal consultations with the Government, the Bank team engaged in 
additional consultations with development partners and c iv i l society through separate meetings. 
Feedback received from these meetings i s reflected in the CPS document. 

135 . Donors emphasized the need f o r a common approach, while civil society organizations 
emphasized their r o l e in monitoring. Two messages came out clearly in the consultations. First, 
development partners increasingly recognize the need fo r a common approach in supporting much 
needed structural reforms in an environment where there i s limited commitment by the authorities. 
Second, c iv i l soc ie ty organizations insisted on partnership with the Bank in introducing sound 
monitoring and evaluation practices. Given that ensuring a strong development impact o f public 
spending i s the cornerstone o f the Bank program in BH, partnership with c iv i l society organizations 
with demonstrated capacity to promote sound monitoring and evaluation practices w i l l be explored 
further during this CPS period. 

34

IV. M A N A G I N G R I S K S 

136. 
Despite strong economic performance and a reasonably healthy portfolio, the level o f 
risk in the B H program i s substantial. 

Internal 

137 . The greatest risk t o implementation of the B H program i s political obstruction o f 
economic reforms. The previous CAS assessed that sufficient reform commitment would allow 
for a strong structural reform agenda through a ser ies o f DPLs, anchored by the SAA with the EU. 
This CPS i s more cautious and proposes to support reforms in the base case through investment 
loans and advisory support, with policy-based lending only in the high-case and subject to 
assessments o f commitment. 

138 . Heightened political polarization between the three constituent peoples and the key 
political parties leads to delays and contentious negotiations. The positions o f the Entities are 
often mutually exclusive. For example, while the Federation generally seeks a stronger role for the 
State in every project, the RS would generally prefer no State involvement. This charged 
atmosphere makes project preparation, negotiations, effectiveness and implementation slow. To 
mitigate the risk o f slow or faltering project implementation, the degree and form o f the State-level 
involvement w i l l be negotiated on project by project basis. Agreement w i l l be sought on the 
aspects o f the project to be undertaken at the State level early in project preparation. Political 
economy analysis w i l l be undertaken in each project and strong signals o f ownership and 
commitment w i l l be required prior to proceeding. The political costs o f reform and risks o f 
instability need to be weighed carefully against the potential growth and poverty reduction benefits 
they could bring. 

139. The complex and fragmented governance structure of B H potentially undermines 
government transparency and accountability. This potentially allows entrenched in te res ts and 
informal networks along ethnic, professional and economic interest l i n e s to thrive. In such an 
environment, corruption may be difficult to detect. The Bank w i l l continue to use Bank-systems o f 
financial management and procurement to mitigate the risk o f fund misuse. 

140. The transition from I D A to I B R D may reduce BH’s interest in Wo r ld Bank loans. B H 
has been borrowing on IDA hardened terms for some years although BH’s per capita income 
exceeded the normal ID A cut-off. The blending arrangement proposed in this CPS and the recent 
price reduction for IBRD loans w i l l help the BH authorities move smoothly from ID A through 
blend towards IBRD-only status. 

141. Access to other sources of finance, including significant EBRD and EIB loans and EU 
grants may also render the Bank’s products and advice less attractive. The World Bank has 
partnered successfully with other development banks in BH to leverage (rather than compete with) 
their programs. The authorities have a genuine interest in continued World Bank support to BH. 
The relationship between the Bank and the B H authorities remains strong as evidenced by the 
Client Survey (Ap r i l 2007) which reports strong satisfaction with the Bank in BH. Meanwhile, 
increasing attention to Africa by bilateral donors may see international aid flows to B H decline at a 
faster-than-anticipated pace. Coordination with other donors and the strength o f the Country 
Office help to keep the World Bank’s advice relevant and timely. 

142. Substantial risks exist that outstanding domestic claims w i l l be settled a t a fiscally 
unaffordable level. Such an outcome would r e f l e c t ongoing pressures by vested interests - which 

3 5 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F Y 0 6 F Y I I 

the governments have resisted so far - to provide more generous settlement terms than the 
estimated face value o f about 16 percent o f 2007 GDP. Risks are also large so that the ultimate 
settlement of property restitution, and any other contingent liabilities that may emerge, could 
undermine debt sustainability. 

Externa l 

143. The key external risk t o BH’s program arises from the lack o f resolution of KOSOVO’S 
status. Specifically, i t i s feared that discussion on autonomy or independence for Kosovo could 
negatively affect the political environment in BH. Lack o f international support for a divided BH, 
including from the EU, may inhibit such a move. 

144. H igh growth rates in recent years have undermined the need to make structural 
change in the economy f o r the medium-term. A sharp reversal o f the currently favorable 
external climate, particularly high international prices for metals and wood, could result in a ‘hard- 
landing’. This CPS period w i l l see a more sustained and strategic use o f communication that seeks 
to inform the public o f the costs o f inaction on the reform front and to stimulate debate about 
options and trade-offs. As other emerging markets, BH faces risks related to the ongoing 
turbulence in international financial markets. There are also risks that negative economic events in 
one country in the region could spill over to others since the foreign-owned banks which dominate 
BH’s banking system are present throughout the Central and Eastern Europe and beyond. Slower 
inflows o f foreign investment, should these risks materialize, would have a negative impact on 
BH’s growth prospects. 

145. The OHR maintains an interventionist approach in BH w ith active use o f the ‘Bonn 
Powers’. Should the international community’s support for this role and the approach wane, BH 
may become caught in a political gridlock, falling further behind its neighbors. There i s currently a 
broad agreement amongst the international community that such a role i s s t i l l needed in BH.

EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

INTRODUCT ION 

This completion report evaluates the implementation o f the World Bank Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) FY05 - F Y 0 7 fo r Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). The current Bank program has 
been closely focused on supporting key reforms in BH envisaged under the country’s Poverty 
Reduction Strategyhledium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS). The FY05 -FY07 CAS period 
has been characterized by: 
relatively strong growth, driven largely by high international prices for BH’s main 
commodity exports, but 
slow progress in structural reforms and therefore in BH’s transformation to a modern 
market economy. 

COUNTRY’S OBJECTIVES 

In the MTDS, BH committed itself to pursue three objectives in parallel during the period 2004- 

2007: 

0 

0 

Create conditions fo r sustainable and balanced economic development. 
Reduce poverty by 20 percent from the 2004 level. 
0 Accelerate EU integration. 

COUNTRY OUTCOMES 

B H has come a long way s ince the end o f the 1992-95 conflict, but a lot more remains to be done to 
achieve the MTDS goals. The physical post-conflict reconstruction effort has progressed well. The 
Government has implemented numerous political, security sector and state-building reforms, which 
enabled the start o f SAA negotiations in December 2005. BH experienced strong growth over the 
past three years (5-6 percent o f GDP). Some economic reforms, most notably the successful 
introduction o f a flat rate VAT from the start o f 2006, as well as customs and banking sector 
reforms, have also been completed and have earned B H an upgrade o f i t s credit rating by Moody’s 
(from B3 to B2) in early 2006. 
Nevertheless, a large outstanding reform agenda remains. A large current account deficit (estimated 
at 16.9 percent o f GDP in 2007) poses a risk to macro-economic stability, and unemployment and 
poverty remain high. Thus, there i s an urgent need to accelerate structural reforms and improve the 
climate for private sector development while ensuring that state building and EU integration 
activities are carried out in a fiscally responsible manner. 

CAS OBJECTIVES 

The CAS for B H covering FY05 -07 was presented to the Board o f Directors in September 2004, 
and was anchored in the MTDS. 
I t was structured along three mutually reinforcing pillars, 
reflecting BH’s principal challenges: 

0 Pillar I : 
0 Pillar 11: 
0 Pillar 111: 

Improving public finance and strengthening institutions; 
Promoting sustainable private sector led growth; and 
Investing in key soc ia l and economic infrastructure. 

42 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F Y O b F Y I I 

Annex 2 

This CAS marked the end of exceptional post-conflict levels o f I D A fo r BH . 
IDA 
commitments were reduced from an average o f over U S $ l O O m i l l ion per year during the immediate 
post con f l ic t reconstruction (FY96 - FY03) to an average o f about US$40 million per year during 
this CAS period. B H continued to benefit from exceptional access to IDA, despite a per capita 
income three times above the IDA threshold. 

CAS O U T C OM E S 

Overall CAS performance was moderately satisfactory. The Bank’s investment operations 
continued to have a positive impact in improving access to basic services, developing core 
infrastructure in support o f economic growth, and strengthening the f inanc ia l sector. Most o f the 
projected outcomes were fully or partially achieved during this CAS period. However, 
Government commitment to structural reforms proved to be elusive. The Bank’s adjustment 
operations (today Development Policy Loans - DPLs), although based on MTDS-identified 
priorities, failed to trigger necessary re fo rms . The complexity and aggregate level o f ambition o f 
Bank adjustment operations also contributed to this result. 

W O R L D B A N K PERFORMANCE 

The Wor ld Bank’s overall performance was moderately satisfactory. Investment projects were 
appropriately designed and well supervised leading to satisfactory outcomes and a strong, positive 
development impact. However, the reform scenario pursued by the Bank during the FY05-07 CAS 
was complex and overly ambitious. The Bank misjudged the Government’s and Parliament’s 
capacity and readiness to pursue such an ambitious program o f re fo rms . Nevertheless, the Bank 
remained proactive and flexible in resolving identified weaknesses and has maintained a strong 
relationship with the client. Apart from the failure o f some adjustment operations, most o f the 
investment credits maintained satisfactory performance ratings throughout the CAS period. 
According to a recently conducted c l i e n t survey, the Bank’s analytic and advisory activities remain 
highly valuable in informing policy dialogue and w i l l play an important role beyond this CAS 
period. The client survey also showed a high level o f satisfaction with the work o f the Bank in BH, 
and 60 percent o f respondents requested a greater involvement with financial and knowledge 
support. 

LESSONS FOR FUTURE CPS DES IGN 

Recommendations for the preparation o f the next CPS are summarized below: 

Ta i lor the CPS to the level and areas o f Government commitment and capacity to 
deliver on reforms. Identifying areas o f intervention that have strong ownership by the 
Government w i l l be the key challenge for the next CPS. 

0 

Improve political economy analysis when deciding about the instruments to pursue 
development priorities. Experience with some adjustment loans and technical assistance 
operations during this CAS suggests that the Bank overestimated the capacity o f the 
Government to deal with several complex reform processes in parallel. Better analysis o f 
the political economy in the B H should be applied during the preparation o f the next CPS. 

0 Pursue reforms through investment lending and, provided there i s political 
commitment, very focused DPLs in the outer years. Several investment operations

Continue to use AAA as the basis f o r policy dialogue and formulation o f the new CPS

1. INTRODUCT ION 

This report reviews the experience implementing the World Bank’s Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) presented to the Board o f Directors in 
September, 2004. The Bank’s program under the CAS FY05-07 was closely focused on supporting 
key reforms in B H envisaged under the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategyhledium-Term 
Development Strategy (MTDS). The FY05-07 CAS period was characterized by: 
relatively strong growth, driven largely by high international prices for BH’s main 
commodity exports; and 
slow progress in structural reforms and therefore in BH’s transformation to a modern 
market economy.

2. COUNTRY’S OBJECTIVES 

BH’s complex political and institutional environment, with a State-level of government and 
two entities (the Federation and Republika Srpska) each with revenue-raising powers, continues 
to present a challenge for domestic policy makers as well as international community actors. Not 
surprisingly, the authors o f the MTDS experienced many difficulties while trying to develop a 
comprehensive yet r e a l i s t i c and sustainable development strategy for BH. Finally, after a 
successful consultative process, a l l levels o f government in B H committed themselves to pursue 
three objectives in parallel during the period 2004-2007: 

0 Create conditions fo r sustainable and balanced economic development. 
Through implementation of the macroeconomic reform scenario o f the MTDS, B H aimed to 
restore partial creditworthiness on the international capital markets, establish a functioning 
market economy and strengthen the capacity o f domestic companies to compete in external 
markets, particularly in the EU market. In view of variations in the level o f economic development 
between different parts o f the country, creation o f a more balanced and equitable development o f 
a l l parts o f B H was also recognized as c ruc ia l . 

0 Reduce poverty. 
The 2005 Poverty Update found that one in five inhabitants o f B H may be considered poor. 
The MTDS aimed to lower the poverty rate by 20 percent from the 2004 level by accelerating 
structural reforms, which in the short term might have caused job losses, and consequently an 
increase in poverty, but would have put BH on a longer-term path o f sustainable growth. Therefore, 
a l l levels o f government were urged to implement such economic policy measures that would 
address the main causes o f poverty including: slow pace o f reforms, high unemployment, poor 
quality o f education, and high levels o f corruption. The MTDS outlined the following reforms and 
measures that were to be implemented in order to achieve projected poverty reduction: (i) f i s c a l 
reform to ensure a more effective collection o f public revenues and higher assistance to the poor; 
( i i ) accelerate the private sector growth to increase employment; ( i i i ) establish an adequate system 
o f social protection; (iv) reduce corruption; (v) reduce the level o f “informal economy”, which 
would lead to increases in pensions and reduction o f poverty among the elderly; (vi) ensure 
safeguarding o f human rights guaranteed by the existing legal framework and signed international 
trea t ies , which would lead to a better integration o f r e t u r n e e and Roma population into the 
community and reduce the poverty levels among these categories; (vii) fu l ly implement the Law on 
Gender Equality; and (viii) the reform o f the education system. 

45

Annex 2 

0 Accelerate EU integration. 
Integration o f BH into the EU has been a generally accepted goal o f all governments and all 
segments o f society fo r some time. The MTDS aimed to accelerate integration o f the country into 
the EU, and the focus was placed on signing and implementation o f the Stabilization and 
Association Agreement (SAA). In particular, by implementing the actions outlined in the MTDS, 
BH would have met the second and the third Copenhagen Criteria, i .e . the existence o f a 
functioning market economy able to endure on the EU market, and the ability to assume 
obligations arising from EU membership. 

3. COUNTRY ’S PROGRESS TOWARDS ITS OBJECT IVES 

Macroeconomic performance 

3 . 1 
Economic activity has remained robust, supported by some structural reforms 
introduced before and during the CAS period, privatization o f some enterprises, as well as 
buoyant remittances and rap id credit growth. Nonetheless, conditions for sustained private- 
sector led growth are yet to be created, leaving growth vulnerable to a substantial slowdown. Over 
the past decade, nominal GDP has trebled and i s now approaching pre-war levels. The 
reconstruction process has generally been highly successful, due to BH’s own efforts and 
unprecedented levels o f donor support (donor flows amounted to more than US$5 billion, including 
commitments by the Bank o f more than US$1 .1 b i l l ion in credits and grants between 1995 and 
2006). Average r e a l GDP growth has picked up to 6.3 percent in 2006 from about 5 .3 percent on 
average in the previous three years, due in large part to the re-starting o f production a t M i t t a l S tee l 
a f te r i t s privatization, and the impetus to production from a jump in international prices for metals 
and other raw materials. Consumer price inflation, anchored in the currency board arrangement, 
has been stable and/or low, except for the one-off pick up in inflation in 2006 due to the 
introduction o f the VAT . The current account deficit has narrowed to about 10.7 percent o f GDP 
in 2005 from about 20 percent on average in earlier years, due to robust across-the-board export 
growth and much improved s ta t is t ica l coverage in the context o f V A T introduction. Nonetheless, 
the current account deficit has subsequently widened again to 16.9 percent o f GDP in 2007and 
remains large and a key vulnerability. External weaknesses are exacerbated by limited progress in 
advancing structural reforms, including privatization, which has kept inflows o f foreign direct 
investment low (approximately 3 .5 percent o f GDP a year). 

3.2 
The V A T was successfully introduced. One o f BH’s major achievements during the CAS 
period was successful introduction o f a state-wide single-rate V A T from the start o f 2006. Also 
noteworthy was the harmonization o f indirect taxation, culminating in the establishment o f the 
Indirect Tax Authority at the beginning o f 2004. The RS introduced simplified personal and 
corporate income tax laws in 2006; the Federation in la te 2007. 

3.3 
B H rating on external debt was upgraded to B2 in early 2006. Moody’s Investors 
Service upgraded BH’s key debt ratings to B2 from B3 in early 2006 in light o f the economic and 
institutional advances that had taken place s i n c e the rating were first assigned in March 2004. The 
affected ratings include the foreign currency country ceiling for debt and the Government o f BH’s 
domestic and foreign currency issuer ratings. The rating outlook i s s t i l l stable. 

3.4 
Large government spending remains a drag on the economy. Government spending 
amounts to about one-half o f the official GDP (and over 40 percent o f GDP adjusted for the 
informal economy). Even when adjusted, spending i s about 5 percent o f GDP higher than other 

46

Annex 2 

countries in south eastern Europe and well above fast growing economies in the region, including 
the Baltics, Ireland or Slovakia. Strong revenues from the V A T helped the modest fiscal surplus in 
2005 triple in 2006, but the medium-term outlook i s at risk due to decisions enacted before the 
October 2006 elections to further increase non-targeted social benefits. Resolving outstanding 
domestic claims resulting from war damages, property restitution, and frozen currency deposits 
could also add a significant burden to the budget, as could plans to boost infrastructure spending on 
roads and electricity generating capacity. 

3.5 
Absence o f rule-based intergovernmental transfers worsened fiscal imbalances 
between levels o f governments (vertical) and across regions (horizontal). The new VAT 
allocation mechanism seeks to address, at leas t partially, both the vertical and the horizontal 
imbalances in intergovernmental f i s c a l transfers; however, its r e a l impact i s still unknown. There 
are substantial regional variations in per capita revenues and expenditures, with municipalities 
witnessing the largest horizontal f i s c a l disparities in both entities. Uneven regional economic 
development and reliance on an origin-based tax sharing principle has resulted in the poorest and 
stagnating regions being left behind. Vertical f i s c a l imbalances favor the revenue-raising entities 
and run against the State level government and the municipalities because o f their very limited own 
revenues as a source for financing their current responsibilities. 

Unemployment and poverty reduction 

3.6 

BH has made a l i t t l e progress i n reducing unemployment and poverty. While new data 
enabling estimates o f poverty for 2004-2007 w i l l be available only after the next Household 
Budget Survey i s published in 2008, i t i s likely that poverty has fa l len s ince 2004 due to strong 
GDP growth and increases in rea l wages and pensions. Da ta for 2005 suggest that about 1 8 percent 
o f the population i s below the poverty line, with another one-third in danger o f falling in to poverty. 
Unemployment and poverty are strongly linked and remain persistently high (data for 2004 suggest 
that about 20 percent o f the population are unemployed; a more recen t Labor Force Survey put the 
number at 3 1 percent, but there are questions as to the quality o f data underpinning this result). 

3.7 

Social services: relatively high spending levels do not lead to satisfactory outcomes. 
Inefficient spending within institutionally complex structures results in poor outcomes. Education 
and health outcomes are broadly comparable to other countries with similar incomes, but much 
lower than would be expected given high current spending levels. In education, while general 
government expenditures are relatively highi6 (higher than the OECD average), education 
outcomes are unacceptably low. For example, the percentage o f students performing below 
minimum acceptable standards in the 4th grade mathematics i s at 43 percent in the Federation B H 
and 3 5 percent in the RS. I n the health sector relatively high spending levels also do not seem to 
produce satisfactory outcomes. Indicators related to maternal deaths, infant mortality and 
immunization (measles) are much worse than in other countries with similar levels o f spending. 

3.8 
Social transfers in B H are insufficiently targeted to the poor and there i s no evidence 
that these transfers have had any impact on poverty reduction. According to the Bank’s Public 
Expenditure and Institutional Review (September 2006), soc ia l transfers financed via general 
revenues amount to 4 percent o f GDP, with veterans’ benefits accounting for about two-thirds o f 
this spending. During the CAS period, these untargeted benefits were increased. Only a small 
fraction o f general revenue financed transfers are means-tested with the aim o f providing a safety 
net fo r the most vulnerable groups. While veterans’ benefits a re very high and not based on need, 

l6 As a percentage o f GDP 

47 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY11 

Annex 2 

the social welfare and child protection system in BH remains underdeveloped with spending 
relative to GDP lower than in almost a l l countries in the region including the new member states o f 
the EU. The MTDS acknowledges that reform i s needed to introduce fewer better defined benefits, 
more efficient benefit administration, and better targeting mechanisms based on vulnerability rather 
than the status, but political w i l l to make such changes has been lacking. 

3.9 
Progress in advancing structural reforms has been limited. Privatization has barely 
been advanced in the Federation BH over the las t two years, while the RS authorities have recently 
made reasonable progress. In particular, progress on this front slowed substantially ahead o f the 
elections held in October 2006. As a result, the private sector generates only about one-half of 
GDP. The business environment i s not perceived as investor-friendly, despite recent improvements 
in the areas o f business registration, bankruptcy and business inspection. The Bank’s Do ing 
Business 2008 rates B H 105‘h out o f 178 countries (roughly equivalent to i t s neighbors but well 
behind the new EU member states and lower than 2006 and 2007 ratings). The key areas o f 
concern are: starting a business, dealing with licenses and permits, and registering property. 
Licensing and permit requirements are also excessive, with both indicators worse in the Federation 
BH than in the RS. Recent passage of the business registration and business inspection laws in both 
entities offers a real opportunity to advance private sector development. 

3.10 
Levels o f corruption are still high and “state capture” remains the biggest concern. 
The World Bank study “Anticorruption in Transition 3 ” found that the highest level o f state capture 
in the ECA region was perceived by firms i n BH. The impact o f state capture was also perceived to 
have an increasing trend in 2005 compared to 2002 figures. State capture r e f e r s to corruption in the 
law-making process (powerful business e l i t e s influence decision and policy making o f the state) 
and can have a very negative impact to an economy and society as a whole, because i t can 
fundamentally and permanently distort the “rules o f the game” in favor o f a few privileged 
insiders”. 

Accelerate EU integration 

3.1 1 Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations are technically complete 
and BH joined NATO’s Partnership f o r Peace program. Furthermore, in July 2006, the B H 
Directorate for European Integration (DEI) developed the “EU Integration Strategy o f Bosnia and 
Herzegovina”, a comprehensive document which reviews the situation in BH, the situation in the 
EU and necessary measures to be taken in the process o f EU integration. Seven consultative 
working groups composed o f 124 c iv i l servants from State and Entity ministries and institutions, as 
well as external national experts, developed this Strategy, which i s a comprehensive document 
covering the period right up until full membership in the EU. The fac t that B H opted for 
developing an EU Integration Strategy at such an early stage reflects i t s intention to accelerate and 
assume fu l l ownership o f the integration process. However, B H did not manage to initial i t s SAA 
during the CAS period due mainly to the failure to agree on police restructuring measures. 

Revised MTDS 

3.12 
Implementation o f the MTDS could be significantly improved through better 
prioritization and more realistic planning. B H revised i t s MTDS in 2006. The revised strategy 
reaffirmed BH’s commitment to the three main objectives outlined in the original strategy. 
However, i t recognized that the implementation and impact o f reforms could have been 

17 

Anticorruption in Transition 3 - Who i s Succeeding.. . . and Why 

48 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F YO b F Y l l 

Annex 2 

considerably improved through better prioritization. The revised MTDS, that was approved by the 
Council o f Ministers and both Entity governments and subsequently presented to a l l three 
parliaments, disaggregated the three main objectives into the following six general development 
priorities in BH: 
0 Maintain macroeconomic stability; 
Increase private investments; 
Restructure the economy; 
Increase employment and strengthen connections between human resources and the labor 
market; 
Improve the system o f soc ia l protection; and 
Increase transparency and capabilities o f BH soc ie ty .

3.13 

The revised MTDS i s an improvement to the original document but i t requires 
stronger linkages to the budget and medium term expenditure framework (MTEF). As 
outlined in the Joint Staff Advisory No te on the Revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IMF 
and IDA, June 2007), further improvements could be made to the strategy, including: 
The development of a costed strategy integrated with annual budgets, the MTEF and the 
Public Investment Program (PIP), and consistent with the f i s c a l revenues and foreign 
assistance likely to be available. 
Greater prioritization focusing on and clearly linked with poverty reduction and growth 
enhancement, specifying realistic implementation timeframe. 
An improved set o f monitoring indicators, related to overall objectives and inputs that can 
be controlled by the government. . 

4. CAS OBJECT IVES 

The FY05 - FY 0 7 CAS was anchored in the MTDS and was structured along three mutually 
reinforcing pillars, mirroring BH’s principal challenges: 

0 

Improving public finance and strengthening institutions, through: 
( i ) a leaner and more efficient public administration and c iv i l service; 
( i i ) institutionalization o f f i s c a l coordination between various levels o f government; 
(iii) more efficient and higher quality education administration; 
(iv) better-targeted and more e f f ic ien t soc ia l safety nets; and 
(v) greater transparency and accountability o f public resource management. 

Promoting sustainable private sector led growth, through: 
(i) lower barriers to business activity; 
(ii) more competitive, investment-friendly enterprises; 
(iii) improved corporate sector operations; 
(iv) more robust private sector financing services; 
(v) increased efficiency and access to core economic infrastructure; and 
(vi) more e f f i c i e n t and sustainable natural resources utilization. 

0 

Investing in key social and economic infrastructure, through: 
(i) promoting effective protection o f the vulnerable through a fiscally sustainable social 
safety net, including rationalized veterans benefits; 

49 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Annex 2 

(ii) improved health sector management and better access to quality health care; 
(iii) improved service quality in water and sanitation, electricity, and loca l roads; 
(iv) a higher quality and more equitable education system; 
(v) greater rural agriculture productivity and profitability; and 
(vi) conservation o f critical forests and mountain ecosystems. 

5. CAS RESULTS 

5.1 

The CAS was result oriented. While no t formally a results-based CAS, since such CASs 
were mainstreamed only in January 2005, the BH CAS was still results oriented. The CAS 
contained a monitoring and evaluation system starting from a “results framework” (which lays out 
the logical relationships between interventions and outcomes) with measurable indicators to track 
progress. 

5.2 
The CAS has been generally well aligned w ith the MTDS and i t s moderately 
satisfactory results reflect BH’s moderately satisfactory overall performance against the 
MTDS targets. The three pillars o f the CAS closely mirror the objectives o f the MTDS. O f the 
three CAS Pillars, Pillar 2 “Promoting sustainable private sector led growth” has had the best 
progress. Pillars 1 and 3 - “Improving public f inance and strengthening institutions” and 
“Investing in key soc ia l and economic infrastructure” made l e s s progress because o f the slow 
implementation o f the reform program and the delayed start o f several projects. The matrix which 
outlines progress against agreed outcome indicators i s attached as Annex I to this report. 

5.3 
Results under P i l la r 1 “Improving public finance and strengthening institutions” 
were seriously affected by the lack o f progress in implementing structural reforms. Despite 
progress in strengthening budgetary practices, and rationalizing intergovernmental transfers a large 
number o f results under this pillar were not achieved. Overall, 8 out o f 23 outcome indicators under 
this pillar were not accomplished (see Annex I). General government spending was reduced to 
about 48 percent o f GDP in 2006, but i t i s still much larger than most other countries in emerging 
Europe and faster growing economies in other parts o f the world. There was l i t t l e progress in 
improving the efficiency o f the education sector administration. Only limited progress was made in 
ensuring better management o f the soc ia l protection system. New legislation on veteran benefits 
was adopted but annual budgets in the Federation far exceeded the targets agreed in the CAS ( i .e . 
the legislated nominal freeze at the 2005 level was not maintained). The pension re fo rm strategy 
has not been formulated. The PEIR, as the key piece o f analytic work underpinning this pillar, 
provides recommendations on improving the composition, quality and effectiveness o f public 
spending to help shift to a more growth-oriented f i s c a l policy. The PEIR recommends reducing 
general government spending by 7 percent o f GDP by 2010 to help reduce the government burden 
on the economy and help accommodate f i s c a l pressures, including those related to settling 
domestic claims and restitution and strengthening public institutions as EU accession i s advanced. 

5.4 
Progress under infrastructure projects and continued strong performance i n the 
financial sector contributed to satisfactory performance under P i l la r 2 “Promoting 
sustainable private sector led growth”. There has been continued progress in developing core 
infrastructure in support o f economic growth. Projects supporting investments in solid waste, the 
power sector, urban infrastructure and road management and safety maintained satisfactory 
performance throughout the CAS period. A l l outcome indicators related to “private sector 
financing services”, “core infrastructure” and “growth based on more e f f i c i e n t use o f natural 
resources” were either fully or partially accomplished. In the financial sector, banking has 
remained strong and has further improved performance. The Financial Sector Assessment Program 

50 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY l l 

Annex 2 

provided recommendations on additional steps that need to be taken to ensure the long term 
soundness o f the financial sector in BH. The Bank-supported microfinance operation (Second 
L o c a l Initiatives Project) met the objective o f ensuring sustainable access to credit services for 
micro and small enterprises. Legislation on business registration and inspections has been adopted 
in the two entities in an attempt to improve the overall business environment. However, a lack o f 
progress in corporate restructuring and privatization negatively affected results under this pillar. 
The Bank’s Policy Development Programmatic Credit and Privatization Technical Assistance 
Credit operations failed to trigger appropriate actions on these two fronts. 

5.5 

P i l la r 3 “Investing in key social and economic infrastructure”: access to basic services 
has improved but the social sector s t i l l does not provide adequate services to the vulnerable 
population. Large inefficiencies in the health and education sector are yet to be addressed. There 
was modest progress in improving efficiency, quality and access to health care. Education system 
remains poorly aligned with the changing needs o f the economy. The soc ia l protection system i s 
also ine f f ic ien t and requires the introduction o f better targeting mechanisms to benefit the poorest 
and the most disabled. The PEIR provided an assessment o f i n e f f i c i e n c i e s in these sectors as well 
as recommendations on actions that could be taken to address the identified weaknesses. On the 
other hand, Bank supported infrastructure projects, as well as efforts made under the Community 
Development Project and Small Scale Commercial Agriculture Development Project, have helped 
improve access to basic services across the country. Agricultural productivity has increased and the 
Bank financed operations contributed to notable improvements in the quality o f and access to basic 
services in water and sanitation, solid waste, electricity, and transport. 

5.6 

The modestly satisfactory reform performance resulted in a reduced lending program 
- between low and base case. Base case lending triggers required satisfactory macroeconomic 
performance, satisfactory MTDS implementation, satisfactory progress in improving the business 
environment, satisfactory performance towards a reformed public administration and private sector 
wage determination mechanisms, and a reduction in the public sector wage b i l l as a share o f GDP. 
As discussed in the previous sections, these triggers were only partially met. Consequently, the 
Bank lending program was between low and base case. The base case lending envelope was 
projected at US$152 million while the actual lending program was US$123 million (81 percent o f 
the base case). In light o f the adjustment operations not moving ahead, the Bank’s teams responded 
quickly and redirected resources to areas where further investments were needed and would have 
positive development impact. Additional financing was approved for four investment operations, 
while new operations were designed to meet demands in the agriculture sector, land registration 
and to help the country prepare a response in the case o f avian f lu outbreak. 

5.7 

A t the same time, progress has been made against the high case (IBRD) lending. An 
assessment o f BH’s progress i s presented in Table 1. 

5.8 

Effectiveness delays - the key cross-cutting portfolio issue. Complex signing and 
ratification procedures in three levels o f government caused significant delays in project 
implementation. A l l the projects approved in this CAS period experienced significant effectiveness 
delays’’ and required several extensions o f the effectiveness deadlines. While effectiveness delays 
may be another indicator o f the poor ownership of the projects, procedural (rather than substantive) 
issues were the main reason for delays in the complex administrative set up o f BH. Delays in 
forming parliaments and governments after the October 2006 e lec t ions blocked every activity on 
this front for several months. However, the State level Council o f Ministers recently expressed 

Effectiveness delay - delay i n declaring the credit effective more than three months after approval,

procedure.

6. IDA PERFORMANCE 

6.1 

Satisfactory performance was maintained under most o f the investment credits. 
Projects aimed at strengthening the f inanc ia l sector were well designed and effective, with Private 
Sector Credit playing a ro le in strengthening the banking sector in the RS while the Second L o c a l 
Initiatives (Microfinance) Project continued with successful development o f the microfinance 
sector in BH. A In the agriculture sector, Small Scale Commercial Agriculture Development 
Project has been successful in developing sound agriculture practices and building capacity o f 
f inanc ia l intermediaries to extend financial services to farmers. Bank teams designed effective 
operations in the area o f infrastructure and energy. These operations maintained satisfactory 
performance throughout the reporting period (see Annex 11). Similarly, adequate design and 
supervision o f projects aimed at strengthening loca l governments and improving capacity o f the 
local utility companies (Solid Waste Management, Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery, and 
the Community Development Project) lead to a positive e f f e c t in stimulating loca l economic 
development. 

6.2 

Performance under most of the adjustment credits and technical assistance credits 
was less than satisfactory. Poorer performance was found in the three structural adjustment 
credits (Second Social Sector S t ruc tu ra l Adjustment Credit - SOSAC 11; Economic Management 
Structural Adjustment Credit - EMSAC; and Business Enabling Environment Structural 
Adjustment Credit - BAC), and related technical assistance projects (Social Insurance Technical 
Assistance Project - SITAP; and Privatization Technical Assistance Project - PTAC). These 
operations were designed during the previous CAS period (CAS FY02-FY04) with the objective to 
tackle a backlog o f tough structural reforms. The BH authorities were not able to achieve a l l the 
requirements for tranche releases under the structural adjustment credits, resulting in these 
operations experiencing serious delays. While there has been continued, although slower than 
expected, progress under BAC and SITAP, poor performance under SOSAC 11, EMSAC and 
PTAC led to cancellation o f these operations. 

0 SOSAC I 1 - the credit was intended to cap, in nominal terms, very high war veterans’ 
benefits and to redirect social transfers to the most vulnerable groups in society. Although 
the RS has come some way toward meeting the conditions, political pressures have led to 
back-tracking by the Federation BH, which instead substantially increased total spending 
on war veterans. Despite extensive discussions, the Federation B H authorities have proved 
unable to undertake a minimum credible package o f reforms that would allow a 
restructuring o f the credit. The V A T revenue surge has encouraged significant f isca l 
expansion in both the RS and the Federation B H in the lead up to October 2006 elections. 
As a result, two years after the Board approval the credit could not be declared effective 
and finally U S $ 5 1 million o f the IDA credit lapsed on June 30,2006. 
0 PTAC - lapsed on August 16, 2006 with l e s s than US$4 million o f the US$23 million 
disbursed five years after the credit was approved. This primarily reflected a lack o f 
enthusiasm on the part o f the authorities, especially in the Federation, to borrow for 
techn ica l assistance despite the concessional nature o f the credit. Government officials 
have suggested that their reluctance reflected high prices charged by international 
consultants, but have been unable to hire even (lower-priced) loca l consultants, making this 
argument untenable. In the Federation, the key underlying reason for the unsatisfactory 
performance under the credit reflects lack o f political consensus on the pace o f 
privatization. In the RS, progress has been somewhat better and the credit helped finance 
consultants for the largest privatization in the country to date (RS Telekom). 

53 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Annex 2 

EM S A C - lapsed on December 3 1 , 2006 with U S $ l O million disbursed in December 2004 
and an undisbursed second tranche o f US$24 million. The decision to l e t the second 
tranche o f the credit lapse was due to lack o f progress in meeting the agreed conditions. 
Namely, attempts to advance higher education reform failed; no progress was made in 
advancing reforms o f public wages, and internal audit laws were not passed (the three 
remaining EMSAC conditions). Six months after the credit lapsed, the authorities enacted 
a version o f the higher education law that has been under discussion before the credit 
lapsed, but the law lacks many o f the provisions that would have made i t acceptable to the 
Bank. Similarly, eight months after the credit lapsed there i s no progress achieved on 
public sector wages, and only the RS has enacted an internal audit law. 

B A C -while slower than originally anticipated, progress continues to be made in the areas 
o f business registration and inspection reform. Although the closing date o f this credit has 
been extended ten times, each time it was clearly linked with progress against a certain 
benchmark. The Bank team has received a “highly satisfactory” QAG rating for the quality 
o f supervision. 

6.2 
A Policy Development Programmatic Credit (PDPC) that was planned to account fo r 
40 percent of the CAS base case lending program was not delivered. The Bank team identified 
corporate restructuring as the critical issue to be addressed during this CAS period and Government 
counterparts repeatedly stated the need for an operation i n this area. However, during PDPC 
preparation the Government demonstrated l i t t l e actual commitment to corporate restructuring. At 
the same time, the Bank team was unable to identify an “entry point” to develop a coherent 
corporate restructuring policy program. The proposed approach that would link significant 
payments to fictitious and redundant workers to encourage them to leave companies, with 
enforcement o f changes in ownership and management practices in state-owned companies, proved 
to be overly complex and ambitious. Finally, given the performance o f other adjustment credits and 
the lack o f BH’s commitment to structural reforms, i t was decided that PDPC should not proceed. 

6.3 
The lack of government commitment to undertake structural reforms and overly 
complex operations, resulted in less than satisfactory performance under adjustment 
operations. A combination o f several factors led to this result. First, the Bank overestimated 
government’s capacity and commitment to pursue s truc tura l reforms in the complex political 
environment o f BH. After the 2002 elections, for the f i r s t time s ince the war, BH had a government 
with a four year mandate. The impressive results o f the post-conflict reconstruction and the relative 
lack o f political tensions suggested that the international community may be successful in 
supporting the newly elected governments to pursue a more dynamic reform agenda. However, the 
Government’s ownership o f the reform agenda proved to be weak and the key reason for the lack 
o f progress. Second, some o f the projects supported by the Bank were overly complex. The targets 
to be achieved under the above mentioned adjustment credits were numerous. Further, the reform 
scenario was based on the available data that proved to largely underestimate the s ize o f GDP and 
overestimate the current account deficit. For example, IMF projected a fiscal deficit o f 5 . 8 percent 
o f GDP in 2003 and three percent o f GDP in 2004 while the outcome was substantially different 
with a f i s c a l deficit o f two percent o f GDP in 2003 and 0.4 percent o f GDP in 2004. As the global 
economy entered into a period o f robust expansion with metal prices surging, the pressure to secure 
external funding for the budget and to reduce the current account deficit eased. Finally, the VAT 
revenue surge in 2006 and the prospect o f new elections, which were held in October 2006, further 
reduced the appetite to secure budget funding by pursuing tough, although much needed, reforms. 

54 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYOB-FYI1 

Annex 2 

6.4 

I D A was proactive in trying t o improve the Government’s ownership o f the reform 
agenda. The Bank consulted very closely with the BH governments as well as with key 
development partners regarding cancellation o f these loans. In January 2006, a high level retreat 
was held between the Bank team and the key government o f f ic ia ls including the Chairman o f the 
Council o f M in is te rs , the Prime Minister o f the Federation BH and the Ministers o f Finance from 
both entities, to discuss next steps in moving the reform agenda forward. On this occasion 
government officials confirmed their commitment to the reforms envisaged under the adjustment 
credits and the Bank expressed readiness to restructure some operations, subject to demonstrated 
progress over the short-term. However, there was little evidence o f such progress in the following 
months and i t was finally jointly agreed that allowing these credits to lapse was the most 
appropriate course o f action in the given circumstances. 

6.5 

The Bank team demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in allocating I D A 
resources to the sectors and operations which demonstrated capacity for further progress. 
Poorer performance in areas o f structural reform and the lack o f Government’s willingness and 
capacity to engage in corporate restructuring reform might have suggested that ID A resources 
allocated in this CAS would not be used. Instead, the Bank’s teams identified sectors where new or 
additional financing may be used productively. While such flexibility was welcomed by the B H 
Government and ensured maintenance o f a good relationship between the Bank and i t s client, this 
carried a risk o f abandoning certain projected outcomes. Nevertheless, a l l new and additional 
financing was in line with the MTDS and CAS objectives. 

6.6 
The Bank maintained a strong relationship w ith the BH Governments and i t s services 
are still considered as highly valuable. I n spite o f the problems encountered with adjustment 
credits as discussed above, the Bank maintained a strong relationship with the client. The client 
survey, carried out in October - November 2006, interviewed about 250 stakeholders, two thirds o f 
whom were Government o f f i c i a l s at different levels. The client survey indicated high level o f 
satisfaction with the Bank. In terms o f the Bank’s effectiveness in BH, clients have had a favorable 
impression with an average rating o f 7.52 on the sca le from 1 to 10. This compares favorably to the 
World Bank global average o f 6.4. Interestingly, almost 60 percent o f respondents wanted more 
Bank involvement and only about five percent thought that the Bank should be phasing out and be 
l e s s involved than before. The Bank’s knowledge combined with i t s financial resources still 
seemed to be highly (and equally) valuable. Limited use o f local experts and bureaucratic policies 
and procedures were identified as the two greatest weaknesses. Government’s commitment and 
weak capacity were assessed as the most significant factors inhibiting future sustainable growth 
and development in BH. 

6.7 

Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) carried out during this CAS period have 
provided strong input f o r the current and future policy dialogue. The key pieces o f ana ly t ic 
work included: Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR); Labor Market Update; 
Financial Sector Assessment Program; Debt Sustainability Analysis; and Fiduciary Update. 
Although these pieces o f analytic work, and the PEIR in particular, triggered some important 
policy dialogue during this CAS period, the contribution o f these reports w i l l extend beyond this 
CAS and w i l l form an ana ly t ic basis for the next CAS. In addition to providing an excellent 
analysis o f public expenditures that informed and triggered policy dialogue on this subject, the 
PEIR dissemination was also highly satisfactory. PEIR dissemination and discussions on particular 
sector issues involved sector teams and has contributed to broader understanding o f problems 
related to public spending in BH. The PEIR dissemination i s summarized in Annex I11 to this 

5 5 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08 -FY I1 

Annex 2 

report. In addition to these, the Bank provided a set o f t e n Policy Notes2’ to the newly elected 
governments. These policy notes provide a summary assessment o f the areas that require actions 
over the next four years and provide recommendations about priorities. 

6.8 

Overall, BH’s portfolio performance indicators compare well with E C A and Bank 
averages (see Table 3 below). The average age o f projects at the end o f F Y 0 7 was 3.3 years and 
the overall disbursement ra t io was 15.4 percent. In ECA, the average age was 3.2 years and 
disbursement ratio was 18.8 percent while for the Bank as a whole the average age was 3.4 years 
and the disbursement ra t io was 22.8 percent. Effectiveness delays were the main reason for the 
lower disbursement ratio in FY07 . The percentage o f commitments at risk was 3.3 compared with 
10.1 in ECA and 14.7 for the Bank.

This CAS marked the end o f exceptional post-conflict levels o f I D A for BH . IDA 
commitments were reduced from an average o f over U S $ l 00 million per year during the immediate 
post conflict reconstruction (FY96 - FY03 ) to an average o f about US$40 million per year during 
this CAS period. The number o f projects has been reduced from 20 at the end o f the last CAS 
period to 16 at the end o f FY07 . The active portfolio of Bank financed operations at the end o f 
F Y 0 7 amounts to about US$300 million. About 37 percent o f the committed amount has been 
disbursed (US$112 million). The l i s t o f projects i s attached as Annex I1 to this report. BH’s 
continued exceptional access to IDA, despite a per capita income now three times higher than the 
IDA threshold, was justified given i t s lack o f access to IBRD or capital market finance. However, 
in the next CPS, B H w i l l need to graduate to IBRD terms, which may also improve the 
Government’s ownership and planning o f the use o f resources borrowed on l e s s concessional 
terms.

producer o f generic pharmaceutical products to substantially increase variety o f domestically 
produced drugs and replace expensive imported medication. In particular, support to further 
development o f the microfinance industry in BH represents a success story o f complementarities 
between IDA and IFC. The microfinance industry which had been initially launched and 
developed with support o f ID A continues to develop into a commercially viable industry with 
support from LFC. Also, IFC has been closely following opportunities to support private sector 
participation in infrastructure. However, slow progress on privatization prevented IFC from 
engaging with financing and advisory services in infrastructure projects. I n addition to B H specific 
investments, IFC has also invested in one regional project and two private equity funds, which 
operate in Southeast Europe, including in BH.

I F C Advisory Services in BH are provided through PEP-SEt4 and have been focused 
on specific programs covering four business lines: 
Value Addition to Firms: which seek to increase knowledge and improve practices 
through a combination o f direct company-level assistance, public awareness campaigns 
(combination o f trainings, seminars, workshops), and in-company consultancies. Expected 
impact o f the programs are: (i) improving management practices in both financial 
institutions and industrial companies, with the objective o f attracting more investment; (ii) 
increasing competitiveness o f loca l companies looking for export opportunities in the EU 
as well as global markets; (iii) improving supply-chain practices i n scrap metal, plastic and 
glass recycling industries and increasing collection and re-use o f recyclable materials. 
Business Enabling Environment: with programs on alternative dispute resolution, and 
sub-national competitiveness. The alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program has been 
active since 2003 and seeks to introduce quicker, cheaper and better access to justice for 
companies and individuals through mediation. In cooperation with FIAS, IFC has been 
streamlining regulations related to business inspections, permits and l icenses , and 
increasing the efficiency o f regulators. The program i s expected to increase private sector 
investment and reduce the cost o f doing business in selected municipalities. 
Access to Finance: with programs on housing f inance , micro-finance, and sustainable 
finance. IFC has supported the development o f micro-finance institutions, through a 
combination o f financing and advisory services, to develop new products such as energy 
efficient home improvements. IFC has also supported the transformation o f microfinance 
institutions into fully regulated financial institutions. Current investment and advisory 
services clients include MI-BOSPO and EKI. 
Infrastructure: promoting private sector participation in a l l infrastructure sub-sectors. 
Slow progress on privatization has prevented IFC from engaging in a more active advisory 
role in the privatization o f key infrastructure projects and in attracting private sector 
participation.

Annex 2 

8. LESSONS FOR SUBSEQUENT CPS DESIGN 

8.1 
Ta i lo r the Bank supported program to the level and areas o f Government 
commitment and capacity to deliver on reforms. Government capacity and commitment to 
reforms i s the key. While rather obvious, such a principle has proven its full value in BH. The Bank 
seemed to misjudge the political complexity o f B H and i t s Government’s expressed commitment to 
pursue structural reforms was taken at face value. Identifying areas o f intervention that would have 
unconditional ownership by the Government and would have the greatest development impact w i l l 
be the key challenge for the next CPS. The Bank team should involve counterparts in the early 
stage o f the CPS preparation. 

8.2 

Improve political economy analysis when deciding about the instruments to pursue 
development priorities. Recent experience with structural adjustment loans and technical 
assistance operations should not be interpreted as failure to recognize the country’s main 
development challenges. On the contrary, in the design o f both SOSAC I 1 and EMSAC the 
priorities that should be urgently addressed were identified by the government, but frustrated by 
political factors. However, while developing the reform agenda to be addressed under these two 
credits, the Bank teams also overestimated capacity o f the Government to deal with several parallel 
reform processes (military and police reduction, constitutional changes, EU integration, public 
administration reform, soc ia l sector reform, education reform, investment climate, privatization 
etc.). Better analysis o f the political economy in the BH should be applied during the preparation o f 
the next CPS. 

8.3 

Pursue reforms through investment lending and, provided there i s political 
commitment, very focused DPLs in the outer years. A substantial and tough reform agenda i s 
ahead o f the recently elected governments a t a l l levels in BH. The Bank has tried to assist with a 
combination o f structural adjustment credits (containing conditions related to progress i n almost a l l 
key areas), investment loans, technical assistance operations and ESW to strengthen BH’s capacity 
to implement needed reforms. The results o f such a multi-faced approach were not encouraging. 
On the other hand, several investment operations helped move the reform in their respective sectors 
forward (health, energy, roads, solid waste management). Efforts should be made in the new CPS 
to recognize potential o f investment operations to speed up the reform processes. Development 
Policy loans may be a feature o f a future high-case scenario, should the appetite for reform change. 

8.4 

Consider project design, which allows for performance-based flexibility, while at the 
same time deepening the single economic space, strengthening the State, and fostering social 
cohesion. Recent experience suggests that there may be a need for greater flexibility in the project 
design to support reforms and investments where they can make the greatest development impact 
using performance-based allocation o f some project financing. However, care w i l l be taken to 
ensure that such flexibility does not exacerbate divisions between the two Entities. Such an 
approach would be exercised only i f it i s requested by the authorities and i f i t w i l l not undermine 
e f fo r ts to deepen the single economic space and foster soc ia l cohesion in BH. 

8.5 
Focus on results and importance o f monitoring and evaluation using Bank financed 
operations to impact sector-wide monitoring o f results by the authorities. The Bank teams 
should ass is t the Government to set up mechanisms to monitor i t s own performance and be on top 
o f the agenda, including enhancement o f the country’s overall s ta t is t ica l capacity. The focus on 
results should clearly go beyond Bank financed operations. The Bank teams should help their 
counterparts develop appropriate results framework for a l l operations. 

5 8 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

Annex 2 

8.6 

Create an enabling environment f o r CPS implementation. As discussed in sec t ion 6.3, 
the Bank overestimated the capacity and ownership o f the Government to pursue structural 
reforms. A t the same time, the Bank should have recognized that even with the stronger 
Government’s ownership such an ambitious reform scenario would have required a carefully 
tailored communication s tra tegy that would help the Government explain the benefits o f reforms 
and the costs o f inaction. Discussion about the main pillars o f the next CPS should be followed by 
a discussion about a broad communication strategy that would help the Government better 
communicate the potential benefits o f the proposed operations. 

8.7 

Improve internal communication and greater synergy between the Bank teams from 
different sectors should be encouraged. Greater synergy between the Bank’s sector teams, and 
across the World Bank Group, may lead to better outcomes and help the Government effectively 
respond to cross-sectoral issues. Internal communication between the teams should be improved. 
The PDPC experience showed that poor communication between sector units resulted in an overly 
complex and ambitious operation for which there was little interest among the counterparts. 

8.8 

Continue to use AAA as the basis for policy dialogue and formulation of the new CPS 
program. During this CAS period, the Bank produced several important documents that should 
form a basis for CPS consultations. The P E R and policy notes i n particular w i l l be useful in 
informing policy dialogue. Finally, regional studies (Doing Business, Anticorruption in Transition, 
L i f e in Transition Survey) attracted a l o t o f interest among the policy makers and opinion formers. 
These studies provide c lear evidence about the trends in BH in comparison with other countries in 
the region and should be used strategically to develop domestic “champions” o f reforms. 

8 .9 

Reduced IDA allocations, and a likely small IBRD lending program, will necessitate 
concentration on fewer operations and a less ambitious reform agenda. This w i l l also require 
closer collaboration with other international partners to leverage World Bank Group resources. In 
particular, the Bank should complement the EC and support BH’s EU integration efforts. 

CONCLUSION 

The results o f the previous CAS and the Bank’s overall performance were moderately satisfactory. 
Most o f the investment credits maintained satisfactory performance throughout the CAS period, 
and infrastructure projects in particular continue to make positive development impact. Although 
based on stated commitments in the MTDS, the reform scenario pursued by the Bank during the 
FY05-07 CAS was complex and overly ambitious. The Bank also misjudged Government’s 
capacity and readiness to pursue such an ambitious program o f reforms. However, the Bank 
remained proactive and flexible in resolving identified weaknesses and has maintained strong 
relationship with the client. The Bank Group’s analytic and advisory activities remain highly 
valuable in informing policy dialogue and w i l l play an important role beyond this CAS period. 
Finally, portfolio performance indicators suggest that the appropriate actions were taken to ensure 
that a healthy portfolio i s carried forward into the next CPS period. Important lessons can be drawn 
from this CAS that should influence design o f the future program. The importance o f the 
Government’s demonstrated commitment and ownership i s obviously the key. However, better 
assessment o f the political economy, complexity o f the environment and well defined 
communication strategy are as important in developing a sound program.

Annex 5 

The s igna ture o f the S A A w i l l require evidence that the police restructuring i s irreversibly on track, 
as well as fu l l cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
(ICTY). Progress in the areas o f public broadcasting and public administration reform w i l l also be 
required before the SAA i s signed. Furthermore, B H needs to address key economic issues, in 
particular improve f i s c a l sustainability through increased revenue collection and efficient control o f 
expenditure; resolve satisfactorily restitution and internal debt-related issues; establish a framework 
favoring private and foreign investment and promote enterprise development. 

Top EU and OHR officials have called for a responsible and constructive approach from the 
politicians and warned that i f the stalemate continues, the European perspective for Bosnia and 
Herzegovina w i l l be delayed or even suspended, which would leave the country trailing far behind 
the rest o f the former Yugoslavia in i t s efforts to integrate with Europe. 

3) EU financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina 

Despite the absence o f a signed SAA the majority o f products from Bosnia and Herzegovina can 
enter the EU duty-free, thanks to a preferential trade regime adopted in 2000. The regime i s valid 
until 2010 in i t s current form. Trade with the EU represents over 50 percent o f Bosnia and 
Herzegovina’s total trade. 

Between 1991 and 2006, the EU has given B H approximately EUR 2.6 billion in financial 
assistance. In the immediate post-war years funds were focused on refugee programs and 
reconstruction projects and were distributed through the EU’s humanitarian aid arm ECHO. 

S ince 2001 Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a beneficiary o f the CARDS program, with aid 
shifting from post-war assistance to institutional capacity-building and economic development. In 
2001-2006, the total EU assistance to Bosnia has been in the region o f EUR 600 million. Key 
CARDS target areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been public administration reform (including 
customs and taxations), issues related to justice and home affairs (police restructuring, border 
management, and judicial reform) and improvement o f investment climate (including trade, 
education, environment and infrastructure). 

I n order to simplify and harmonize the different external a id components, to fac i l i ta te coherence 
and improve consistency and to achieve better results, the EU i s currently adopting a new f inanc ia l 
aid mechanism ca l led IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) to replace a l l previous 
external assistance programs for candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkan 
region. In i t s current form, P A w i l l cover the period 2007-2013. The overall financial IPA 
envelope for Bosnia and Herzegovina amounts to EUR 226 million in 2007-2009. Assistance 
under the 2007 IPA program totals EUR 62.1 million. P A w i l l support B H in strengthening the 
rule o f law, human rights, social inclusion and the protection o f minorities. Support w i l l be also 
given to the reform o f the media sector, public administration improving the functioning o f the 
judiciary, overcoming high unemployment, and reform the education and public health systems.

Annex 6 

Annex 6: Governance Assessment 

The Dayton Peace Agreement created a complex institutional structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
that laid the foundations o f the current governance26 environment. This structure was designed to 
promote peace and stability, which i t has achieved remarkably well, however, i t has also had 
unintended consequences, such as undermining governments’ efficiency, transparency and 
accountability. Complex and opaque institutional structures allow entrenched interests and 
informal networks along ethnic, professional and economic interests to thrive. 

An international presence under UN auspices has been in place in B H since 1995 . The High 
Representative has executive powers to impose legislation and remove o f f ic ia ls (known as the 
“Bonn Powers”), which have been used extensively. 
Legislative work in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina’s Parliamentary Assembly has been adversely affected by voting along ethnic lines 
and insufficient administrative resources. The election o f BH’s tripartite Presidency continues to 
be in contravention o f European human rights protocols as i t does not allow citizens not belonging 
to the three constituent people to stand as candidates and determines the ethnicity o f each candidate 
elected from the Entities2’. According to the European Commission, on a number o f occasions, 
political parties have l e d negotiations on reform issues for which the government would normally 
be responsible2*. Policy-making between the State and the Entities remains fragmented and State- 
level government structures have sometimes been unable to overcome internal conflicts and 
gridlocks, which has delayed reform implementation. 

Several positive aspects o f governance and recent progress should be noted, including the 
functioning o f the supreme audit institutions, adoption o f the new law on public procurement, a 
free and vibrant press and democratic elections. B H has recently ratified the UN Convention on 
Fighting Corruption and a National Anti-Corruption Strategy and action plan was adopted in 2006 . 
However, implementation o f anti-corruption measures has been slow, due in part to a lack o f 
resources. Transparency International’s index o f corruption perception2g for the past three years 
shows a high level o f perceived corruption in BH. Strategic direction and commitment to tackle 
the governance agenda in a comprehensive manner appear to be lacking. Strategies and action 
plans are in place, but they are not properly implemented. 

According to the World Governance Indicators, BH lags behind the averages o f its income group in 
several aspects o f governance and behind new EU member states in every aspect. Government 
Effectiveness and Regulatory Quality are very low (just above the 25‘h percentile), but have 
improved steadily since the end o f the conflict. Voice and Accountability has also improved and i s 
now near the midpoint o f countries worldwide. Political Stability and Control o f Corruption remain 
at levels found immediately a f ter the war (the former near the 25‘h percentile, the latter just under 
the 50 th percentile. Considerable and focused efforts w i l l be needed to prevent B H falling behind 
its peers and to bring BH to levels acceptable to the EU. 

In the analysis o f governance, B H appears an outlier in ‘state capture’ which i s captured by BEEPS 
surveys as: To what extent have unofficial payments to influence a) parliamentary votes; b) 
government decrees; c) loca l government votes and decrees had a direct impact on your business? 

The Wo r ld Bank defines governance as “the manner i n wh ich the state acquires and exercises its authority to provide public goods and 
services” and corruption as “misuse o f public o f f ice for private financial gain.” Corruption i s a result o f poor governance and a failure 
o f accountability relationships in the governance system (Governance and An t i -Co r rup t ion Strategy, 2006)

One possible explanation for this finding i s the need to find balance between the various 
constituent peoples in BH. Transparency International (2007) writes, 'a disturbing fact i s that the 
key positions in privatization agencies as well as in managing boards in public companies are held 
by persons whose most important qualifications are that they belong to a specific political party.' 
Obfuscation o f accountability l i n e s and low transparency allow this partial reform status quo to go 
unchallenged. 

Both citizens3' and business3' consider state capture and dysfunctional and corrupt judiciary as 
major obstacles for good governance in the country, as well as revenue systems (tax and customs) 
and police. Citizens are also highly dissatisfied with the soc ia l benefits system and believe that 
education and medical systems are corrupt. A corruption barometer survey conducted by 
Transparency International in 2005 finds political parties, parliament, the legal system, police and 
customs to be perceived as the most corrupt institutions in BH. 

Despite pinpointing the corrupt institutions in society, c iv i l society i s not well organized or strong 
in acting as an accountability mechanism to the government. There i s little pressure from c iv i l 
soc ie ty to institute governance reforms. The Council o f Ministers has signed an agreement on 
cooperation with the non-government sector. C iv i l society organizations tend to register at Entity 
level and few are therefore active country-wide. The World Bank has supported the Youth Voices 
group to engage on policy matters for some years. The Community Development Project with 
WBI support facilitates participatory budgeting at the loca l level. 

The Doing Business survey implies that B H i s a difficult environment for private enterprise to 
function. Starting a business, registering a property, paying taxes are a l l much more difficult than 
in regional comparator countries. BH's overall rank has fallen in the past two years from 91 in 
2005 to 105 in 2 0 0 7 . While there has been no backsliding on reforms, there has been l i t t l e progress 
either and other countries are reforming faster. Again, the ability o f B H to implement reforms i s 
hampered by the complex governance structure. 

The Bank-supported Business Adjustment Credit has played a significant ro le in improving the

inspection and business l icense regime, which has reduced the burden on business. I n the next CPS 
period, the Bank w i l l support implementation o f BH’s Strategy and Action Plan on enhancing the 
corporate financial reporting environment.

EU accession i s one o f the key entry points for the Bank on governance reform in BH. To move 
towards EU accession, B H w i l l need to create European administrative space, characterized by i) 
distinct separation between politics and administration; ii) clearly set accountability lines for the 
professional c iv i l service, iii) clear administrative procedures, iv) solid management control o f 
public funds, and v) overall strength o f administrative and judiciary systems in applying and 
enforcing these arrangements. To do so w i l l involve B H addressing major governance challenges. 
However, current EC governance interventions are concentrated on public administration reform to 
prepare the administration for particular tasks relating to EU accession. Other bilateral donors are 
also involved in governance-related areas in BH, including: SIDA, USAID and the Netherlands 
involvement in the Government Accountability Project; USAID’s support for the Center for 
Investigative Journalism and tax administration reform; and DFID, SIDA and the Netherlands 
collaboration on public Administrative Reform. 

I n applying the Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption strategy in B H during this CPS, the World 
Bank w i l l identify sectors where governance reforms are possible and visible so as to create a 
demonstration effect, while also stimulating demand fo r good governance through loca l level 
accountability interventions and strategic communication. The Bank w i l l work with the 
international community to agree on the key principles and priorities for supporting governance 
efforts in BH. As governance reform i s not explicitly part o f the governments’ agenda, the Bank 
w i l l approach reform directly through sectoral initiatives in the core lending program and through 
advocacy and communications in the non-core part o f the program.

K e y opportunities and challenges 

BH i s making steady progress in i t s economic recovery f rom an aid-dependent to a s e l f - 
sustaining economy. Economic expansion and growth have remained robust over the last few 
years, despite slow re form implementation. However, much remains to be done in order to 
achieve long-term, sustainable, private-sector led growth. 

The private sector’s contribution to GDP stands at 5 5 percent in BH, wh ich i s be low regional 
averages. Serbia had an equivalent private sector contribution to GDP in 2005, Croatia’s 60 
percent and F Y R Macedonia’s 65 percent are relatively close, but Bu lgar ia and Poland w i t h 75 
percent or Hungary and the Czech Republic’s 80 percent o f GDP produced by private sector are 
far ahead. The current h igh share o f pub l ic expenditure to GDP i s crowd ing out private sector. 

Privatization, restructuring and bankruptcy 

Accord ing to the 2007 W BG en te rp r ise survey, there were some 34,000 companies registered 
in BH in 2005, w i t h a further 800 yet to be privatized ( o f which, some 130 are strategic 
companies). In 1999, the Government adopted a voucher pr iva t iza t ion program, supported b y 
the international community, resulting in large numbers o f privatized SMEs. However, the 
program resulted in fragmented ownership and d i d no t introduce new management or new 
capital. Many o f these companies need further restructuring to make them commercially viable 
and to make them attractive to private buyers. Public and private companies alike have poor 
and deteriorating business performance. Produc t iv i ty and capacity u t i l iza t ion i s relatively low , 
export levels are s t i l l significantly be low that o f imports and many companies are indebted. 
Privatization and corporate restructuring are urgently needed to release the productive assets 
tied up in these companies in to the economy. 

Some key strategic companies s t i l l awaiting pr iva t iza t ion are the large u t i l i t ies , inc lud ing 
power, telecommunication, railways etc. In addition to restructuring, successful pr iva t iza t ion 
w i l l also require sound legal and regulatory frameworks, t a r i f f re form and improved corporate 
governance. The private sector should also be encouraged to participate in major infrastructure 
investments through public-private partnerships. 

Financial sector 

Reforms o f the banking sector have advanced reasonably well, compared to other sectors. The 
bank ing sector i s now ma jor i ty private- and foreign-owned. However, progress in advancing 
non-bank pr iva t iza t ion has been slow, particularly in the Federation. A consolidation o f the 
banking sector m igh t be appropriate. 

Business Environment 

The business environment in BH i s not perceived to be conductive for investment, due to: a 
small and fragmented market; fragmented ownership structures; the slow pace o f privatization; 
and perceived risks o f regional instability. As part o f the former Yugoslavia, B H specialized in 
raw materials, semi-finished products, heavy industry and energy production. The drivers o f 
export growth are food processing, base metals, textiles, wood and chemicals. 

Creating an investor-friendly business environment and attracting F D I w i l l be o f particular 
importance given the large trade and current account deficits. Some progress has been made 
through the last CAS period. F irs t stage reforms have been completed o r are being 

83 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for F YO I - F Y I 1 

Annex 7 

implemented, including, but not limited to: improved access to financing through a pledge 
registry (BH i s ranked 13” on “Getting Credit” indicator, due to the reforms done in this 
sector); modern and transparent bankruptcy system that improved the bankruptcy process; 
reform o f the inspection regime that reduced the burden on business and improved the 
efficiency and effectiveness o f inspections (the Bank’s own survey showed that the inspections 
reform succeeded in bringing down the average number o f inspection days per company to less 
than 9 days countrywide);.a new business registration system that already influenced some 
reduction in number o f days and aims to further reduce the number o f days required to register 
a business; strengthening o f the legal framework for financial sector, in particular insurance and 
banking. 

Overall, the business environment improved somewhat, but more remains to be done. There i s 
an urgent need to speed up the pace o f the reforms. With little reform changes recorded i n the 
Doing Business reports, BH’s relative rank in the Ease o f Doing Business table has stagnated 
(ranking unchanged at 150) as other countries’ reforms outpace those in BH. BH made 
im rovements in the category “Trading across Borders”, where the ranking improving from 
67 to 53 rd place i s due to continued improvement i n facilitation o f cross-border flow o f goods. 
But the report also identified problems with licensing, where BH i s ranked very low. 

IR 

B H should now move to second-stage reforms including: strengthening bankruptcy courts and 
capital markets; reforming l icenses and permits; and reviewing and rationalizing different taxes 
and levies imposed on businesses by various levels o f government. B H has to be able to attract 
more “brown-field” investment in order to fuel private sector growth. To do so, stronger and 
more regulated capital markets and better corporate governance are needed. 

SMEs 

According to the European Bank f o r Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) 2005 report, 
B H i s at the bottom o f South-East Europe (SEE) countries together with Serbia in fueling 
private sector development through strong SME growth. SMEs are likely to be the vehicle for 
short-term growth and employment. The introduction o f VAT i n 2006 has helped to formalize 
many small businesses. 

Labo r market 

B H has high levels o f unemployment and a low labor force participation rate. High taxes on 
wages raise the cos t o f formal sector employment, resulting in a large (perhaps one third o f a l l 
jobs) informal sector. Wage-bargaining mechanisms are figid, contributing to low job creation 
and low worker mobility. Labor mobility i s further hindered by the lack o f harmonization o f 
labor policies between the two Entities. 

Modernized and harmonized corporate (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) laws were enacted 
i n 2006 in the RS and in late 2007 in the Federation, setting the CIT rate at 10 percent and the 
PIT rates at 10 percent and 1 5 percent. This represents a major improvement over previous 
legislation and should help to start improving the demand for labor. 

I n summary, B H i s faced with the following challenges in promoting sustainable private sector- 
led growth: 

A small and fragmented market; 
Serious indebtedness and low capacity utilization o f enterprises, which seriously 
undermines real-sector competitiveness and corporate governance in the country; 

84 

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

Annex 7 

Enterprise assets that are not being released in to productive use; this cou ld be done 
either through privatization, restructuring or bankruptcy; 
Incomplete institutional and legal frameworks to promote private sector participation in 
infrastructure and to se lec t investors through transparent, open and competitive 
processes; 
Poor corporate governance in the real sector, in particular lack o f ownership 
concentration in voucher-privatized enterprises; 
A financial sector, wh ich needs to be streamlined, strengthened and unified, inc lud ing 
leasing, insurance, banking and financial markets; and 
0 Regulatory burdens on business operations (such as non-harmonized taxes, extensive 
time/cost/processing for obtaining certain permits and licenses, 
lengthy court 
enforcement time); 
Labor market r ig id i t ies and social pressures stemming f r om any adverse side-effects o f 
large scale restructuring o f en terpr ises . 

The World Bank Group’s ro le 

The Wo r ld Bank Group provides assistance on several o f the challenges iden t i f ied above. 
Through the last CAS period, the Bank supported a Business Enab l ing Environment Credit 
(BAC ) that yielded several notable results, inc lud ing improved access to finance, faster 
bankruptcy and a more e f f i c i e n t inspection regime. 

However, another adjustment credit that focused on corporate restructuring was dropped due to 
a lack o f commitment by the authorities. In this CPS period, an Enterprise Restructuring Grant 
f rom the European Union, administered b y the Bank, w i l l a im to move the corporate 
restructuring agenda forward w i t h a restructuring o f over a dozen Voucher-Privatized 
Enterprises and w i l l pave the way for further corporate restructuring. 
In response to stated 
demand, technical assistance b y the Bank w i l l also be prov ided to strengthen financial markets, 
as w e l l as to insurance sector. W B I and the Bank are cooperating on a j o i n t project wh ich 
promotes private sector led-growth through focusing o n IC T and competitiveness. 

Bank projects on labor redeployment and assistance to labor and social sectors can help to 
alleviate some problems in these sectors. Instances o f such activities cou ld invo lve dealing 
w i t h the existing poo l o f ‘ f ic t i t ious ’ or ‘waitlisted’ workers and implement measures that wou ld 
systematically resolve this issue in a financially prudent manner that does not create imbalances 
elsewhere in the economy. Similarly, the Bank cou ld support efforts to re form the system o f 
pay ro l l contributions to strengthen bo th supply and demand-side incentives i n the labor market. 

The Wo r ld Bank Group anticipates p lay ing an important ro le he lp ing the government to 
structure possible PPP transactions. Du r ing FY07, the Bank he ld a tra in ing seminar on PPPs 
that was very w e l l attended by a cross-section o f regulators and o f f ic ia ls f rom BH. Fo l low-up 
ac t iv i ty has been requested and w i l l be implemented through the CPS period. In addition, IFC 
i s seeking opportunities to support private companies that w o u l d consider investing in the 
infrastructure through long term financing, inc lud ing PPP in the road and energy sectors. In 
addition, F IAS I IFC ’s advisory services w i l l continue to focus in 4 business l ines : SMEs and 
linkages; business enabling environment; access to finance; and infrastructure advisory 
operations. 
In particular, sub-national competitiveness w i l l focus on reducing burden to 
business i n terms o f obtaining some permits and licenses, wh i le Alternative Dispute Resolution 
(ADR ) program w i l l somewhat address the stock o f outstanding disputes, thereby releasing 
additional capital fo r investment.
