EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 

Introduction. T h i s Country Partnership Strategy covers the pe r iod July 2007-June 201 1 
(FY08-1 l), and follows the 2003-2007 (FY04-07) Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (Report No. 
26747-MOZ). I t s purpose i s to support t h e Government o f Mozambique (GoM) in implementing 
i t s second Poverty Reduction Support Strategy, or PARPA I 1 (the Portuguese acronym fo r 
Second Ac t ion Plan fo r t h e Reduction o f Absolute Poverty). As the harmonization agenda has 
made significant progress in Mozambique, development partners and Government have 
collaborated to j o i n t l y analyze development needs and t o coordinate t h e development o f country 
assistance strategies. T h i s i s the f i r s t Country Partnership Strategy fo r the W o r l d Bank Group in 
Mozambique. I t i s the second assistance strategy developed j o i n t l y between IDA, I FC and MIGA 
for the i r support to Mozambique. 

ii. Development Context. Mozambique has been a strong economic performer over t h e past 
decade. Between 1996 and 2006, fo l low ing the devastating c i v i l war that ended in 1992, the 
economy grew at an average annual rate o f 8 percent. The poverty headcount index f e l l by 15 
percentage points be tween 1996/7 and 2002/3. Economic expansion was made possible by 
overall macroeconomic stability, sound po l icy reforms, g row th in agriculture, post-war 
reconstruction, mega-projects, and strong support f r om development partners. However, .part o f 
this g row th i s attributed to a post-conflict catch-up effect that cannot last indefinitely. Sustained 
fu tu re g row th i s expected to be driven b y coordinated infkastructure development, natural 
resource extractive industries, energy, agriculture, tourism, private sector development, and 
increased regional trade. 

iii. In addition to physical investments, many o f key sectors requ i re second-generation 
reforms in order t o create t h e enabling environment t o unleash a new round o f growth. 
Governance reforms are a priority, and are especially important in pub l ic financial management, 
decentralization and pub l ic sector management, as also i s legal and j u d i c i a l reform, inc lud ing 
re fo rm o f regulatory frameworks (e.g., 
in re la t ion t o land administration and markets, tax, 
business licensing). These reforms need to be combined with ins t i tu t ion and capacity-building, 
especially at t h e loca l level, resu l ts monitoring, and increased c i t izen participation in the design 
and oversight o f pub l ic interventions. Such re fo rm w i l l foster improvement in t h e investment 
climate, and ensure that t h e poor also continue to benefit f r om growth. 

iv. 
Despite impressive growth, Mozambique remains one o f the poorest countries in the 
wo r ld with high l e v e l s of absolute poverty and malnutrition, ranking 168 out of 177 countries in 
the Human Development Index fo r 2004. W h i l e t h e country i s o n track to achieving t h e 
M i l l e n n i um Development Goal (MDG) fo r poverty reduction, significant progress needs to be 
made in increasing access to health care services, water and sanitation services, and quality 
higher education, especially in ru ra l areas, in order t o attain the other MDGs. 

v. 
H I V / A I D S poses perhaps the single greatest threat to Mozambique’s continuing g row th 
and development. Governance issues pose another significant risk. Upcom ing elections in 2007 
(provincial assemblies), 2008 (municipal), and 2009 (national presidential and parliamentary) 

may also affect d i f f icu l t decisions needed for second generation reforms. Inadequate fiduciary 
controls and a failure to strengthen pub l ic financial accountability mechanisms cou ld result in 
increased corruption, wh ich wou ld undermine government c red ib i l i ty and private-sector 
confidence. Finally, Mozambique i s also vulnerable to exogenous shocks, inc lud ing weather- 
related shocks, terms-of-trade shocks, and external private investment decisions that have a 
significant macro-economic impact. 

vi. 
Bank Group Strategy. W i t h i n this context, t h e W o r l d Bank Group, in collaboration with 
Government and development partners, has developed a strategy that: (i) incorporates lessons 
f rom the previous CAS; (ii) leverages t h e Bank Group’s comparative advantages; and (iii) 
exploits partnership opportunities; while (iv) p r io r i t iz ing the country’s harmonization agenda and 
supporting Government’s poverty reduction objectives. T h e strategy includes th ree pillars, within 
wh ich five major result areas encompass 18 development outcomes, as follows:

vii. Delivering the Bank Group Program. Assuming progress under the performance 
framework relative to other IDA beneficiaries - and an ID A 1 5 replenishment broadly 
comparable to IDA 14 - the annual financing available t o Mozambique over FY 0 8 - 1 1 i s expected 
to be approximately $155 m i l l ion . This i s s i m i l a r to the $680 m i l l i o n over fou r years allocated 
under the 2003-7 CAS. Given t h e resu l ts o f the Deb t Sustainability Analysis, Mozamb ique i s 
expected to receive financing in t h e f o rm o f credits. I f i t maintains t h e current leve l o f 
performance, PRSCs w i l l comprise approximately 40 percent o f IDA’S commitments over the 

CPS period. Should performance shift significantly in e i the r direction, especially in the core 
governance areas, t h i s amount w i l l be adjusted in consultation with Government and G18 
partners. SWAPS and common fund arrangements will be used to m in im ize transactions costs for 
a l l development partners. 
viii. Analytical and Adv iso ry Ac t iv i t ies (AAA) will be a ma jo r ins t rumen t o f support. In some 
sectors or themes, AAA w i l l f o rm the sole source o f support f r om the Bank Group, as financing 
f rom other development partners i s leveraged. AAA w i l l be organized around the ma in p i l la rs o f 
the strategy, and w i l l address knowledge gaps o r deepen understanding in particular areas; 
facilitate po l icy dialogue; and provide greater support fo r government programs, as requested. 

ix . 
The r i s k s discussed above have been taken in to account in the engagement framework. 
R isks o f exogenous shoFks are generally beyond the direct con t ro l o f Government, and their 
actual occurrence should in principle justify greater commitments o f resources f r om the Bank 
Group in t h e fo rm o f financing and advice. R isks o f HIV/AIDS, governance deterioration, and 
po l icy reversals are within Government’s grasp, and wou ld justify a more nuanced response. 

x. 

As a relatively small country with correspondingly small market power and resources, 
Mozambique’s longer-term g row th strategy needs to be built o n i t s comparative and strategic 
advantages and complementarities within southern Africa. Collaboration with neighboring 
countries and even the w ide r international community i s also necessary t o address pub l ic goods 
and trans-boundary issues such as water resources management, energy, transport, trade, 
migration, and, above all, HIV/AIDS. Du r ing the next four years, the W o r l d Bank Group w i l l 
support Government’s efforts to take advantage o f regional integration and g row th opportunities, 
especially relative to the Southern A f r i c a Development Community (SADC). 

x i . 
The development context i s also changing for t h e W o r l d Bank Group in Mozambique. 
Supporting the Paris Declaration with i t s focus o n collaboration among development partners, 
and the entry o f new partners such as the Government o f China, t h e Millennium Challenge 
Corporation and the Gates Foundation, present new opportunities fo r partnership. In addition, the 
maturing needs o f development in Mozambique will offer opportunities t o the widest suite of 
Bank Group products - fo r national and regional IDA resources, IFC, MIGA, IBRD partial risk 
guarantees, carbon financing and various t r u s t funds, inc lud ing the G loba l Environmental 
Facility, and so on. The W o r l d Bank Group w i l l consider creative business, operational and 
organizational models that will leverage i t s comparative advantages in t h i s new environment and 
wh ich w i l l best achieve i t and GoM’s overarching goal o f poverty reduction.

Suggested Top ics fo r Board D iscuss ion . Boa rd members may w i s h t o discuss the 
fo l low ing aspects o f this partnership strategy: 
(a) 
Does t h e draft CPS adequately address the key development challenges that 
Mozambique faces, especially given t h e Bank Group’s comparative advantages? 
I s the proposed program appropriate for a well-performing but poor country 
operating in a changing environment with emerging n ew development partners (e.g. 
Government o f China, Gates Foundation) and meaningfil governance challenges? 
(c) A r e t h e economic and po l i t ica l r i s k s adequately assessed?

1. 
T h i s Country Partnership Strategy covers the pe r iod July 2007-June 201 1 (FY08-1 l), 
and fo l lows the 2003-2007 (FY04-07) Country Assistance Strategy (Report N o . 26747-MOZ) 
wh ich was discussed at the Boa rd o n October 20, 2003 - and the completion report fo r wh ich i s 
at Appendix 6. I t s purpose i s to support t h e Government o f Mozambique (GoM) in imp lemen t ing 
i ts second Poverty Reduction Support Strategy, o r PARPA I1 (the Portuguese acronym fo r 
Second A c t i o n Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty). PARPA 11, approved by Cabinet in 
September 2006, covers 2006-2009 and continues many o f the objectives l a i d ou t in the f i r s t 
PARPA (200 1-2005) but with the next stage o f r e s u l t s largely expected through inves tmen ts in 
ru ra l areas and second-stage reforms. PARPA I1 also adds focus o n key cross-cutting objectives 
that require coordination across key sectors. This Country Partnership Strategy i s t im e d to be in 
sequence with the development o f Government’s strategy, and t o facilitate coordination and 
alignment among development partners’ country assistance strategies. 

2. 
The Wo r ld Bank Group has been wo rk ing with Governrpent and development partners t o 
harmonize development assistance with the ultimate goal o f helping Mozamb ique achieve i t s 
poverty reduction goals e f f ic ien t ly and effectively. Since t h e s ta r t o f the last CAS, the 
harmonization agenda has made significant progress in Mozambique. In 2004, development 
partners s igned a Memorandum o f Understanding to: (i) provide harmonized, predictable and 
effective general budget sup o r t through a j o i n t mon i to r ing framework, 
the Performance 
Assessment Framework (PAF) ; and, (ii) implement the Paris Declaration o n Aid Effectiveness. 
In 2006-7, development partners and Government worked together to j o i n t l y analyze 
development needs and to coordinate the development o f country assistance strategies. T h i s j o i n t 
analysis and review has resulted in t h e development o f the f i r s t Country Partnership Strategy fo r 
the W o r l d Bank Group in Mozambique. 

P 

3. 
The fourteen o r so development partners who were to prepare support strategies in 2006- 
7 undertook f rom late 2005 f ive common j o i n t analyses o n subjects ranging f r om evaluation o f 
progress under PARPA I to significant po l i t ica l economy considerations in Mozambican 
development. These analyses were shared among a l l partners fo r use in t h e i r strategy 
preparations. Government then launched in mid 2006 a formal peer review process (with donor 
and consultant input) o f each proposed d ra f t strategy - through document rev iew and l i v e 
discussion with each partner; t h e i r written, detailed conclusions on each proposed strategy be ing 
shared among a l l donors. W h i l e there were discussions among partners about do ing some j o i n t 
strategies, in the end donors f e l t that p rov ided they each supported P AR P A I1 and took in to 
account the peer rev iew recommendations, especially on areas o f donor concentration and 
collaboration, t h i s was as significant harmonization as could be expected o f j o i n t strategies - and 
was achievable w i t h considerably less bureaucracy, time and effort. As a result, n o j o i n t 
strategies were prepared. 

The Performance Assessment Framework i s the subset o f PARPA I 1 indicators that the G18 development partners 
track on an annual basis as the monitoring fiamework for general budget support. Th e G18 partners are: Afiican 
Development Bank, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, EU, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, 
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the World Bank (IDA). 

4. 
This strategy i s the second country assistance strategy developed j o i n t l y within the W o r l d 
Bank Group between IDA, IFC, and M I G A , continuing t h e practice that started during t h e 
development o f the FY04-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). I t i s the fifth in a series o f 
strategic frameworks that, over t h e past t w e l v e , years, have contributed t o a constructive 
partnership with the GoM . 

5 . 

Mozambique has achieved impressive economic growth since the conclusion o f almost 
three decades o f pre- and post-independence con f l ic t in 1992 and t h e f i r s t democratic election in 
1994. T h e poverty headcount index f e l l by 15 percentage points between 199617 and 2002/3. T h e 
8 percent average GDP g row th rate be tween 1996 and 2006, t h e highest in A f r i c a over that 
period fo r a n o n oil-producing country, i s attributed to consistent sound macroeconomic 
management and po l icy reforms, g row th in agriculture, post-war reconstruction, implementation 
o f mega-projects, and strong support f r om development partners. However, part o f t h i s g row th i s 
attributed to a post-conflict catching-up effect that cannot last indefinitely. Thus, t h e challenge

I. THE CHALLENGE: MORE BROAD-BASED GROWTH 

Overview 

7. 

Mozambique has been a strong economic performer over the past decade. Economic 
expansion was made possible by overall macroeconomic stability, p o l i c y reform, g row th in 
agriculture, post-war reconstruction, mega-proj ects, and strong support f r om development 
partners. 

8. 

T h i s pattern o f development has been accompanied by a steady pace o f change in t h e 
governance structures o f the country. However, the expectation and practice o f participation and 
accountability are s t i l l young, and ins t i tu t ion building i s in the early stages. Under t h e 
circumstances, Mozambique’s performance as a country in recovery and transition i s 
exceptional. However, despite increasingly specific government attention, the challenges o f 
limited public and p r iva te sector capacity and corruption rema in serious. Together, these 
concerns need to be continually addressed to ensure that they do n o t put at r i s k the country’s 
broader growth and pove r ty reduction goals.

Recent Political Developments. Mozambique’s parliamentary elections o f 2004 
reaffirmed Frelimo’s h o l d o n power wh ich i t o r ig ina l ly secured during t h e f i r s t elections in 1994. 
These elections were judged b y international mon i to rs t o be f ree and fair. Mozambique’s track 
record o f po l i t ica l stability has allowed the elections to focus largely o n socio-economic and 
issues - by no means a small achievement. Moreover, democracy and 
governance 
decentralization have encouraged a diversity o f po l i t ica l representation t o emerge. 

10. At the same time, however, many analysts have expressed concern that an imbalance in 
the po l i t ica l system can undermine the effectiveness o f po l i t ica l and institutional checks and 
balances. As t h e dominant party, Frelimo’s influence 
i s significant in a l l th ree branches o f 
Government. Moreover, the Parliamentary passage o f laws has been slow, and th&e are 
complaints that the jud ic ia ry i s not independent. Social accountability i s no t common as citizens, 
c i v i l society organizations and the media have weak capacity and limited participation and 
oversight o f government activities and institutions. Many observers po in t to increasing pub l ic 
dissatisfaction with t h e predictability o f po l i t ics in an environment o f patronage and clientelism; 
t h e h is to r ica l ly l o w participation (40 percent) in t h e 2004 parliamentary election was taken by 
some as an indication o f disillusionment among voters at the absence o f significant party 
o p t i om 2 

11. During t h e next th ree years, th ree sets o f elections w i l l impact the po l i t ica l landscape in 
Mozambique. In 2007, there w i l l be elections o f p rov inc ia l assembly members, implementing a 
requirement o f the revised 2004 constitution. In 2008, the third round o f mun ic ipa l elections w i l l 
OCCUT, and in 2009, the fou r th round o f presidential and parliamentary elections w i l l take place.

Poverty Trends. Income poverty, measured by the headcount ratio, has fa l len steadily 
f rom 69 percent o f the population in 1996/7 to 54 percent in 2002/3. The poverty gap (wh ich 
takes i n t o account t h e distance separating t h e poor from t h e poverty line) has also decreased

poverty reduction (see Appendix 8a, 8b). Desp i te t h i s performance, Mozambique remains one o f 
the poorest countries in t h e w o r l d with h igh leve ls o f absolute poverty and m a l n ~ t r i t i o n , . ~ Per 
capita income was US$340 in 2006, compared with t h e Sub-Saharan A f r i c a average o f US$500. 
Moreover, income inequality has increased slightly since 1 997.5 

13. 
Recent poverty reduction trends po in t to greater progress in rural areas relative t o urban 
areas. However, absolute poverty in 2002/3 was s t i l l mo re prevalent in rural areas (55 percent), 
where t h e ma jo r i ty o f the population live and work, than in urban areas (5 1 percent). T h e poverty 
headcount also differs significantly across regions, ranging f rom 45 percent in the center o f the

country, where the greatest reduction took place over t h e period, t o 66 percent in the south; and 
across provinces, ranging f rom 36 percent in Sofala (in t h e center) to 81 percent in Inhambane 
(in the south). In general, these differences pa r t ia l ly reflect provinces’ relative access t o markets 
and opportunities fo r economic diversification. 

14. 

Access to Pub l ic Services. Pub l ic services are more accessible in urban areas than in ru ra l 
areas, further compounding t h e already d i f f i c u l t realities o f poverty among the ru ra l poor and 
l im i t i n g their opportunity for economic advancement. Sub-regional disparities in enrollment and 
completion rates f o r bo th primary and secondary education are significant: enrollment and 
completion rates are much higher in Maputo, the capital city, than in the more r u r a l northern and 
central provinces. Supply, quality and access t o basic health se rv ices are also mo re limited in 
ru ra l locations. Finally, wh i le the MDG fo r urban water provision should be achieved, i t i s 
unlikely that t h i s w i l l be t h e case fo r rural water provision. 

15. 
Educa t ion . Access to primary education increased f rom 2 m i l l i o n in 2001 to almost 4 
m i l l i o n in 2006, t h e period o f PARPA I. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain. F o r 
example, the primary completion rate i s s t i l l be low 50 percent. Girls’ enrollment, especially at 
the post-primary levels, lags significantly behind that o f boys. Mozambique i s thus at risk o f no t 
being able to achieve the MDG fo r universal p r ima ry education and gender equity in education. 
Progress in imp rov ing access to post-primary education has also been slow. O n l y 500,000 
students are enrolled in secondary education p r o g r h s , and 30,000 
in tertiary programs. 
Significant disparities remain between ru ra l and urban locations, and are exacerbated b y t h e 
demand fo r secondary, technical, and tertiary education wh ich i s h ighe r in wealthier urban areas, 
making i t ever more d i f f icu l t fo r government education policies to be e f fec t ive ly pro-poor. 

16. 

The quality and relevance o f education continues to be a concern. O f the seven m i l l i o n 
people active in the labor market, more than 90 percent have completed o n l y f i v e years o f 
primary education o r less. There i s a significant shortage o f technical and higher leve l skills, 
especially in math and science. O f t h e 30,000 students enrolled in the sixteen higher education 
institutions, less than one-third ma jo r in natural sciences, agriculture, engineering and health 
sciences, and fewer eventually graduate. Nationwide, less than 300 people have Ph.D. degrees. 

17. 
In addition to t h e challenges o f coverage and quality, corruption in the education sector 
diminishes the efficiency and qua l i ty o f service delivery, especially t o the poor. D ive rs ion o f 
funds ensures that less money than intended reaches schools and beneficiaries. Co r rup t ion also 
occurs at the leve l o f ind iv idua l teachers, with children and the i r parents subjected t o varying 
i l lega l practices including: unauthorized charges levied o n school admission forms; bribes t o 
obtain good grades o r exam scores, o r t o buy exam questions; forced payment fo r p r iva te 
tu to r ing in order to get quality instruction; and sexual coercion o f students. These abuses 
pa r t icu la r ly affect poor children as their parents are less l ike ly t o have t h e means, knowledge and 
access t o counter them. Finally, the education sector i s impacted by t h e general c i v i l service 
“ghost worker” problem.6

Health. Even though there has been consistent improvement in some indicators in recent 
years, Mozambique’s health and human development indicators rank among t h e lowest in the 
world. Maternal mo r ta l i ty f e l l f r om more than 1,000 per 100,000 live b i r ths in t h e early 1990s to 
408 in 2003, compared t o the 2000 average o f 910 Sub-Saharan Africa.’ Under-5 mortality 
decreased f r om 219 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 152 in 2004, compared to the Sub-Saharan 
average o f 171 per 1,000 births in 2004.* However, under-5 mo r ta l i ty and maternal mo r ta l i ty are 
higher in t h e more ru ra l northern and central provinces, where the lack o f health care facilities 
limits access t o care. Remote ru ra l areas are also more affected by t h e human resource bottleneck 
faced by the health system: there are no t enough health care workers. The increase in 
government spending o n hospitals in urban centers (partly driven b y the r i s e in non- 
communicable and chronic diseases, and the related increased cost o f care and treatment) 
exacerbates t h e disparities in pub l ic p rov is ion between urban residents and t h e ru ra l poor. As 
with the res t o f Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS and malaria are t h e leading causes of death in 
(compared to 44 years in 1999), wh ich i s lowe r than the Sub-Saharan average o f 47 years. l o y

H I V / A ID S poses one o f the most serious socio-economic problems today fo r the country. 
Mozambique has the seventh highest prevalence rate in t h e world; 16 percent o f the population i s 
currently living with HIV/AIDS. In 2005, the re were 123,000 AIDS-related deaths and 400,000 
children were orphaned when the i r parents died f r om AIDS. Mozambique i s surrounded by 
countries that have some o f the highest prevalence rates in the w o r l d (South Africa, Swaziland, 
Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania). T h e epidemic has devastating effects on 
Mozambique’s economic growth. S tud ies estimate that H I V / A I D S reduces A f r i c a n countries’ 
economic growth by 1 to 2 percentage points per year. T h e Food and Ag r icu l tu ra l Organization 
(FAO) estimates that Mozambique may lose more than 20 percent o f i t s agricultural labor force 
by 2020 because o f t h e disease. Institutions are also losing their professional wo rk force at an 
alarming rate. If the epidemic i s no t curbed, social networks cou ld collapse as the most 
productive age groups w i l l be decimated and fu tu re generations w i l l g row up w i thou t the nurture 
o f a family. Palliative care fo r patients w i l l also drain scarce pub l ic resources. Government has 
p r io r i t ized dealing with t h e HIV/AIDS problem and t h e national response continues to 
accelerate, but i s s t i l l no t commensurate with the need. T h e W o r l d Bank Group and development 
partners continue t o w o r k closely with Government t o address t h i s urgent issue (see B o x 1). 

20. 
As in the education sector, corruption in health service de l ive ry reduces t h e quality and 
quantity o f services that reach the poor. Fraudulent practices include: t h e stealing o f drugs and 
supplies; using pub l ic facilities fo r private gain; requests fo r uno f f ic ia l payments fo r services that 
a re supposed to be p rov ided at n o cost; charging bribes to provide regular services or to speed up 
the provision o f services; using access t o patients in pub l ic hospitals and clinics to t rans fe r them 
to private clinics, and; manipulating the drug registration and procurement process. Weaknesses 
in procurement and financial management at the m in is t ry leve l p rov ide another avenue fo r 
leakage o f funds in the service delivery process. l1

Box 1. The Bank Group and H I V / A I D S in Mozambique 

HIV/AIDS i s a pervasive issue in Mozambique, including for the World Bank Group. T h e Bank Group’s response to 
the epidemic includes interventions aligned with other development partners to influence government policy and 
Mozambican public behavior, to deal with the epidemic in a l l Bank Group operations, and to address t h e issue for 
Bank Group s ta f f . The Bank Group and other partners have played a significant ro le in bringing the attention o f 
Government and political leaders to publicly address the epidemic. T h e Bank Group also discusses H IV IA IDS 
frequently in i t s external relations and public speaking engagements. An HIV/AIDS specialist has been employed in 
t h e Bank’s Mozambique Country O f f ice since 2004 to support our program in general and, more recently, to help 
mainstream H IV /A IDS interventions into a l l Bank Group operations across t h e AFCS2 countries (Mozambique, 
Angola, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe). IFC has a program t o help private businesses address HIV/AIDS. The 
Mozambique Bank Country Office has an in terna l HIV/AIDS confidential counseling and treatment program for 
staff, the counselor being a person living with the disease who benefited fiom a HIV/AIDS treatment program 
supported by IDA and other partners. In addition, t h e second HIV/AIDS project that IDA supports, the MAP 
HIV/AIDS Project, i s instituting a grant management mechanism to support public institutions in implementing 
HIV/AIDS programs. Over t h e next four years, the World Bank Group w i l l support a MAP HIV/AIDS SWAP that 
aims to s treng then the implementation capacity o f the National AIDS Commission, extend the Treatment 
Acceleration Program (TAP), and help develop a regional project with southern Afiica neighbors to deal w i th 
transborder HIV/AIDS issues 

2 1. Water supply and sanitation. A l though poor data qua l i ty and disputes over measurement 
issues make reporting o n access to water indicators a challenge, current data and development 
partner estimates indicate that the MDG fo r access t o water in urban areas has a chance o f b e i n g 
met although i t i s unlikely that the MDG fo r access to water in ru ra l areas w i l l be met unless 
investment i s increased substantially (see Appendix 8a, 8b). Access t o water in urban areas, 
currently estimated at 37 percent, l2 has significantly imp roved through t w o consecutive na t iona l 
water rojects (where IDA i s t h e lead partner) w h i c h have increased access to water in five ma jo r 
cities, strengthened sector institutions and t h e regulatory framework, and successfully p i lo ted 
t h e delegated management model wh ich contracts ou t management to private sector operators 
with oversight by a regulatory body. The urban water strategy no t on ly provides fo r increased 
coverage, i t also aims to secure full cost recovery fo r larger cities so that in f u t u r e investment 
needs can tap market funds, wh ich w i l l enable sector budget allocations to be directed primarily 
to ru ra l and small towns where cost recovery i s limited. IDA i s preparing an operation in FY07 
(Water Services and Institutional Support Project) w h i c h leverages funds f r om the Millennium 
Development Corporation and the A f r ica Catalytic G row th Fund t o scale up t h i s model. 

22. 

Access to safe water in ru ra l areas i s currently estimated at 41 percent. However, the rate 
o f delivery by Government o f new and rehabilitated ru ra l water supply infiastructure has n o t 
increased measurably over the last four years, partly due to implementation problems associated 
with decentralization o f service provision t o districts and municipalities. With t h e central 
ministry n o t yet decentralized, a key issue has been the aligning o f t h e national strategy with the 
processes o f decentralized service delivery institutions. A G o M ru ra l water supply and sanitation 
strategic plan has recently been approved. 
I t secured a consensus among Government, 
development par tners and local governments o n the appropriate ro le o f loca l government in 
service p rov is ion and maintenance, although implementation o f t h i s approach (wh ich w i l l be

development o f t h e SWAP through the F Y 0 7 Water Services and Ins t i tu t iona l Support Project. 

23. 
The incidence o f water borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea indicates that 
imp rov ing urban sanitation i s an important objective in Mozambique. Though G o M has clearly 
g iven water supply (and education and health) a higher p r io r i ty than sanitation, a Strategic 
Sanitation Plan (SSP) was completed in 2004 w i th funding f rom IDA’s first Na t iona l Water 
Development Project. The SSP covers Maputo, Matola, Beira, Dondo, Nampula, Pemba and 
Quelimane, and provides complementary sanitation developments over a 1 5-year planning 
horizon. I t encompasses storm water drainage, and wastewater and so l id waste management, and 
considers infrastructural, institutional, financial and economic aspects. Some in i t ia t ives to 
implement the SSP have been taken. Fo r example, the EU i s implementing a US$27 m i l l i o n 
sanitation project in Beira, and i s mak ing sanitation investments in Maputo. The M C C i s 
planning significant Sanitation investments in Quelimane, Pemba, Nampu la and seven other 
larger municipalities. Nonetheless, the re remains a considerable sanitation challenge in the 
country, especially in paying fo r the recurrent costs o f services. The F Y 0 7 Water Services and 
Ins t i tu t iona l Support Project w i l l a l low IDA to continue i t s engagement with the water sector in 
Mozambique where opportunities can be explored fo r contributing I D A ’ s extensive country and 
sector experience to ongoing and future initiatives to effectively address sanitation issues. 

24. 
In general there i s less concern about corruption in service delivery in t h e water sector as 
compared to the health and education sectors. The ma jo r i ty o f water p rov is ion in ma jo r cities i s 
p rov ided by regulated u t i l i t ies using private sector operators whose accounts a re audited 
regularly. Nonetheless, poor planning and financial management, inc lud ing the accumulation o f 
pub l ic debt in t h e sector, have adverse impacts o n water systems development and delivery. 
Because the Ministry o f Finance has no t made available counterpart funds and processed VAT 
refunds in a timely manner t o the implementing contractors, t h e latter have increased t h e i r prices 
fo r goods and services, thus increasing the cost o f service p rov is ion fo r all. Also, pub l ic 
institutions have no t been paying their water bills o n time, i f at all, wh ich in turn increases t a r i f f s 
fo r private users, inc lud ing t h e poor. Consequently, re fo rm p r io r i t ies fo r the water sector, 
especially for t h e ru ra l water sub-sector, 
include the implementation o f a performance 
mon i to r ing system and better linkages between plans, budget execution, and outputs. 

A Sound Mac roeconom ic F r a m e w o r k 
25. 
Mozambique has pursued sound fiscal and monetary policies fo r m u c h of the past decade. 
I n f l a t i o n was brought to single digits in the 1990s, but then peaked again at 17 percent in 2002 as 
a result o f devastating floods in 2000 and 2001 and a banking crisis. Since then, in f la t ion has 
been kept under control through conservative fiscal and monetary policies (see Table 2). The 
dollar exchange rate has remained broadly stable since 2002, except fo r a pe r iod o f appreciation 
in t h e second h a l f o f 2004 and early 2005, fo l lowed b y several months o f exchange rate 
fluctuations (mainly as a result o f the issues with exchange rate management and a rap id rise o f 
o i l prices in the international markets). Since 2006, the exchange rate - w h i c h i s a managed f loa t 
- has remained fa i r ly stable, responding to supply and demand changes within a na r row band.

Box 2. Relations with the IMF 

The relationship between the G oM and the I M F has been anchored b y A r t ic le I V consultations and ESAF and PRGF 
program negotiations. Mozambique has had four IMF-supported programs s ince 1987. The fifth review o f the most 
recent PRGF arrangement was success fu l ly completed in December, 2006. G o M has requested that the PRGF be 
followed by a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The s ix th rev iew o f the PRGF and the preparation o f t h e PS I i s 
expected to be concluded b y June, 2007. T h e relationship has been consistently constructive, as demonstrated by 
Mozambique’s strong macroeconomic performance since 1987, early accession to full debt r e l i e f under the H I PC 
In i t ia t ive in 1999, and t h e relatively low level o f waivers requested for ESAF/PRGF program reviews. The IMF has 
been prov id ing about 1000 staff hours o f technical assistance per year to respond f lex ib ly to Government fo r macro- 
financial advice. 
The outlook for the IM F / G OM relationship remains favorable, as the G o M has engaged the IMF in a dialogue that 
extends beyond t h e current PRGF arrangement’s closing in mid 2007. Development partners are also invo lved in 
specific po l icy discussions, since a l l stakeholders agree that many macroeconomic po l icy outcomes have structural 
foundations that development partners can usefklly support. Even though the I M F i s no t a member o f the G18 
General Budget Support donors group, the t im ing o f i t s missions i s such as to be synchronized w i th the Joint and 
Mid-Year Review process o f the G18. 
I D A and t h e I M F have worked closely together, including o n the PRSCs and PRGF, advice on the f inanc ing 
package o f Mozambiques’s purchase o f the Cahora Bassa Hydro-power system, and on the re fo rm o f the fiscal code 
governing mineral resources. T h e practice o f holding j o i n t IM F - ID A missions has bo th had synergistic benefits, and 
has reduced the burden on Government o f multiple missions. 

29. 
Pr,ospects fo r 2007-10 remain favorable, inc lud ing fo r strong growth and t h e maintenance 
o f a sustainable external position, as Government i s committed to take t h e necessary f isca l 
measures and pursue a monetary program consistent with a further reduction o f in f la t ion . E n d - o f 
period in f la t ion was 13.2 percent as o f end-December 2006, but i s expected to continue t o 
decrease t o an average 5.9 percent in 2007. W i th slower expansion in credit and some leve l ing 
o f f in o i l prices, in f la t ion i s expected to rema in in single digits through 2009. Central t o th is 
strategy w i l l be a gradual strengthening o f the f isca l pos i t ion underpinned b y an average increase 
in revenue o f 0.5 percent o f GDP per annum. Factors that have contributed to a pos i t ive 
macroeconomic outlook include conservative f isca l policies, efforts to increase revenue 
mobilization, no external borrowing on commercial terms , minimal subsidies to productive 
sectors, and targeting two-thirds o f pub l ic expenditures to p r io r i ty sectors fo r pove r ty reduction. 

30. 
Mozambique i s h igh ly dependent upon o f f i c i a l development assistance, with about half 
o f government expenditure derived f rom external aid. Among development partners, IDA i s the 
largest single financier, accounting for about twen ty percent o f a l l development partner 
contributions. The 18 development partners (“G18”) who provide general budget support 
contribute about 80 percent o f Government’s external financing needs. Such dependency o n 
external a id presen ts a r isk in that Government may be more accountable t o development 
partners than to i t s own citizens. However, the Memorandum o f Understanding signed by t h e 
G18 contains t h e p r inc ip le that Government’s performance w i l l be assessed based o n the same 
reports that i t submits t o Parliament - t h i s e l im ina t ion o f a parallel reporting system fo r external 

- 9 - 

partners i s an essential step to strengthen domestic accountability. Furthermore, Government’s 
development strategy includes a plan t o modernize t h e tax system and broaden t h e tax base 
w i thou t raising tax rates. Revenues are programmed t o increase by h a l f a percentage po in t o f 
GDP per year in the coming years, an objective met in 2005 and 2006. As GDP grows faster than 
aid, Mozambique w i l l reduce a i d dependency and domestic accountability w i l l be strengthened. 

Growth through the New Economy 

3 1. 

Sources of Growth. Strong economic g row th has contributed significantly t o the decline 
in economic poverty. G row th has averaged about 8 percent annually since 1996, a dramatic 
improvement over the performance o f the previous decade, when real GDP g row th averaged 4 
per~en t . ’~ This growth has been sustained by continuing agricultural growth, post-war 
infrastructure rehabilitation, construction o f mega-projects and associated g row th in natural 
resource sectors, growth in manufacturing, and investment in public service provision, The 
sectors wh ich have grown most rap id ly between 1996 and 2005 (as reflected by the percentage 
po in t increase in their share o f GDP over t h e 10 year period), include: transport and 
communications (5.2 percent), manufacturing (3.8 percent), construction (3.5 percent), pub l ic 
service provision (3.1 percent), m in ing (0.9 percent), and restaurants and hotels (0.5 percent). 
These sectors are l ike ly to see a continued relative increase. 

32. 
B y contrast, the two most important traditional activities - agriculture ( inc lud ing 
fisheries) and commerce -- grew less than average GDP growth. A l though agriculture grew b y an 
average 6.6 percent between 1996 and 2005, i t s share o f GDP declined by nearly 12 percentage 
points (to 18.7 percent) while commerce’s share declined by tw o percentage points (to 21.8 
percent) over the same period. Nonetheless, these two sectors remain the largest, and the largest 
employers, accounting together fo r almost 40 percent o f GDP. Agriculture’s importance t o the 
livelihoods o f the ma jo r i ty o f the population requ i res a proactive stance in m i t iga t ing volatility, 
p rov id ing supporting infrastructure, and disseminating productive technologies. 

33. 
The IMF and IDA estimate that fu tu re g row th w i l l be at least 7 percent per annum 
through 2009 under t h e assumption that the re fo rm agenda continues t o be implemented, that 
donor support stays broadly at the current level, and that no ma jo r natural disaster happens. Any 
scaling-up o f aid or increased p r iva te investments should lead t o higher g r ow t h rates. As ou t l ined 
in PARPA 11, a package o f governance reforms, improvements in the business environment, 
investments in physical infrastructure, and the strengthening o f human and ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
i s necessary to achieve the objective o f high, sustained growth and poverty reduction. 

34. 

Drivers o f g row th w i l l continue t o be in infrastructure development, mining, energy and 
manufacturing mega-projects, agriculture, and increasingly tourism. Excep t fo r the mega- 
projects, these activities w i l l facilitate ru ra l development, a central theme o f P AR P A 11. 
Moreover, to ensure that the g row th i s broad-based, promotion o f small and med ium enterprises 
(SMEs) in needed. Finally, Mozambique will need to collaborate with ne ighbo r ing countries to 
leverage economies o f scale fo r markets, t o enhance trade and risk management, and t o find

1985 and 1990 to 15 percent in 1987, and including negative growth rates during 1982,1983, 1986 and 1992.

Mozambique’s continued rap id development depends o n further large and efficient investments 
in infrastructure, inc lud ing an increased energy supply available fo r t h e domestic market and 
improved access to it, roads and transport, water resource management, agriculture, and 
telecommunications. A particular challenge w i l l be t h e strengthening o f smallholder agriculture, 
agribusinesses and SMEs that w i l l have t o occur f o r g row th t o be shared; otherwise, growth 
generated b y the mega-projects w i l l benefit only a small part o f t h e population. 

36 . 

Energy. Currently, on ly 7 percent o f Mozambican households have sustainable access t o 
electricity. Government’s goal i s to increase access t o 10 percent by 2009. Many institutions in 
ru ra l areas, such as schools and clinics, do not have sustainable and affordable access to energy. 
PARPA I1 includes a target o f connecting 500 new institutions t o an energy source b y 2009. IDA 
and the Global Environmental Fac i l i ty (GEF) a re already i n v o l v e d in the ro l l -ou t o f renewable 
energy systems fo r remote schools and clinics. I t i s anticipated that continued support in this area 
w i l l leverage additional resources, as well as po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l developments to support a 
scaling up o f this approach. Potential shortages o f energy supply t o industry may hamper 
Mozambique’s growth. G row th in domestic demand fo r electricity, exclusive o f any significant 
new industrial loads, w i l l increase at about 6-7 percent annually over the nex t decade. Currently 
a number o f new industrial projects are in the advanced stages o f preparation, inc lud ing t h e 
Moatize coal mine, Chibuto I titanium and z i rcon imum mine, and M o z a l I11 aluminum smelter 
projects, but power supply i s a potential constraint t o the i r development. T o meet the g row th in 
domestic demand and planned new industrial demand, Government i s planning significant new 
generation and transmission infrastructure with considerable p r iva te sector participation. 
Government has already begun the process o f selecting private sector strategic investors fo r th ree 
new generation projects wh ich require investments o f around U S $ 4 b i l l ion . ” 
I t i s planned that 
these generation projects w i l l be complemented by a new 1 5 0 0 km transmission l i n e f rom Tete 
to Maputo and beyond, wh ich w i l l become t h e “backbone” o f the national transmission grid. 
F rom a regional perspective, 
there are also opportunities 
f o r m e r
 transmission 
interconnections, inc lud ing between M a l aw i and north-west Mozambique and with Tanzania. I t 
i s anticipated that the WBG w i l l support Government in rea l iz ing these projects, possibly 
through advisory services as well as financing instruments, inc lud ing guarantees. 

37. 

Roads and Transport. Inadequate rural access to t h e road ne two rk and high transport 
costs hinder bo th social development and production. Limited roads means that access to 
education, health and other government services i s more d i f f i c u l t f o r ru ra l populations - and they 
a re more d i f f icu l t t o s ta f f , anyway, as s t a f f generally prefer t o be in less isolated locations. They 
also mean that commercial activities are limited: traders and f inanc ia l services su f fer . And, poor 
road access seriously hinders agricultural g row th and p roduc t iv i ty , limiting access to markets 
and storage facilities fo r Mozambique’s farmers.

Road density per land area in Mozambique i s l o w at 0.05 kilometers o f road per square 
kilometer. T h e present road network provides potential access16 to around 41 percent o f t h e rural 
population; due to the poor condition o f the network, especially in the wet season, the percentage 
o f t h e rural population that has reliable a l l year access i s much smaller. Consequently, one o f t h e 
ma in objectives o f t h e national 2007-201 1 Road Sector Strategy and PARPA I1 i s to increase the 
number o f the ru ra l population with access to an all-season road. Another part o f t h e strategy i s 
to improve connectivity for rural producers and communities, wh ich involves increasing access 
to ports and railroads and decreasing costs o f transport. T h e concessioning o f major po r t and 
ra i lway systems to private o erators fo r rehabilitation has met with m ixed results. The ma jo r po r t 
concessions are ~pe ra t iona l !~ However, t h e concessioning o f railways has met with less success 
due to non-performance o f concessionaires, insufficient mon i to r ing and enforcement o f 
concession stipulations by Government; o n l y 
the Machipanda 
l i n e (Dandomeira 
t o 
Zimbabwehlutare) o f t h e Beira ra i lway i s presently operating satisfactorily. Government i s also 
starting to focus o n the rehabilitation o f ferry t ra f f ic . 

39. 
A l though air transport has an important ro le fo r some activities with h i g h g row th and 
export revenue earnings potential (e.g., business travel, tourism, and high value exports), 
privatization plans have been put o n hold. The planned concession agreement fo r the Mapu to 
International A i rpo r t was drafted but Government decided to cancel the concession and rather 
study options fo r financing and private participation. Government also put o n h o l d the 
p r iva t iza t ion o f LAM, the national airline, in part due to t h e company’s indebtedness. The 
Communications Sector Reform Project (Cr. 35770) supports t h e development o f a i r safety 
regulation and c i v i l aviation law, and capacity development o f t h e C i v i l Av ia t ion I n s t i t u t e . M a i n 
challenges include: financing o f airport infrastructure, particularly in t h e provinces, and 
iden t i fy ing an appropriate medium-term strategy f o r LAM. As the f i r s t Communications Sector 
Re fo rm Project comes to a close, t h e Bank Group team (IDA and IFC) w i l l support Government 
with p o l i c y advice to find strategic investors fo r airports and the national airline. However, IDA 
does n o t expect to provide financing fo r air transport during the period o f the CPS. 

40. 
Agriculture. The agricultural sector i s central to Government’s growth strategy. However, 
challenges a re great: overall agricultural productivity i s very low, many rural people l i v e at near- 
subsistence levels, there i s very l i t t l e water harvesting (in a country alternatively struck by drought 
and flood), even where existing, irrigation systems a re seriously underutilized, and access t o rural 
financing i s negligible. Enhancing agricultural productivity, developing efficient irrigation, 
imp rov ing access to finance and markets, strengthening and expanding value chains, p romo t ing 
agro-processing for exports, and encouraging private sector participation are major objectives o f 
the agricultural growth strategy. In order to support t h i s strategy, PARPA I1 contains targets for: (i) 
increasing access to technologies, extension information, and selected agricultural inputs; (ii) 
p romo t ing the construction and rehabilitation o f agrarian infrastructure, especially i r r iga t ion 
schemes; (iii) improving access to information and input/output markets; (iv) promoting the private 
sector, especially in export markets for cashew, cotton, and sugar; and, (v) imp rov ing commun i ty 
access t o natural resources in a equitable manner fo r sustainable use and management. There i s a 
pressing need to use irrigation resources effectively and t o expand and develop agribusinesses and 
exports. Recent work o n biofbels could open up significant new markets for the agriculture sector.

41. Wafer Resource Munugemenf. Water resources are a ma jo r natural asset 
for 
Mozambique, and are instrumental t o all economic sectors, inc lud ing agriculture, energy, 
industry and commerce, ru ra l development and health. T h e combination o f h i g h climatic and 
hydrological variability, high dependency o f the country o n international rivers, and g row ing 
competing water demands b y some neighbors and productive and domestic users in Mozambique 
represent a serious challenge t o long-term growth. The W o r l d Bank G roup has prepared with 
Government and development partners a Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy that 
could help plan investments in water infrastructure and improvements in water management 
institutions and management practices. T h e objective o f t h i s strategy i s to he lp reduce 
vulnerability to water shortages, and t o provide a minimum p la t fo rm o f water infrastructure to 
underpin g row th in water dependent sectors. P r io r i ty areas o f in te rven t ion identified in the 
strategy include: (i) water resources development and management in the water-stressed south, 
specifically in the Incoma t i and Umbe luz i basins; (ii) small scale water resources development to 
support smallholder i r r iga t ion and provide infrastructure fo r small towns; (iii) assistance to 
Government in iden t i fy ing and implementing t h e environmental and social requirements fo r the 
development o f large water infrastructure (particularly o n t h e Zambezi River); and (iv) 
ins t i tu t ion bu i ld ing in the water resources sector. 

42. 
Telecommunications. Government, with support f r om t h e IDA - f inanced Communica- 
tions Sector Reform Project (Cr. 35770), has fostered an increase in teledensity ( f ixed and 
mob i le l ines) f rom 1 percent in 2000 t o 9 percent in 2006. Desp i te t h i s accelerated growth, tele- 
density i s s t i l l very low, and needs to continue to increase in order to enable growth, especially in 
ru ra l areas. The impact o f increased teledensity - and o f in fo rma t ion and communications 
technologies (ICT) in general - o n productivity, commerce, education, communication and 
governance (through more transparent access to information) i s w ide ly accepted. GoM’s 
ambitious telecommunications targets include: (i) increasing te ledens i ty t o 22 percent by 2009; 
(ii) expanding in te rne t access points by 2009; and (iii) rap id ly scaling up the number o f central, 
provincial, district and mun ic ipa l government institutions linked to the electronic government 
network. Government has also p r io r i t ized development o f Mozambican s k i l l s in science and 
technology, inc lud ing in ICT . PARPA I1 includes targets fo r increasing the number o f 
Mozambicans studying fo r graduate degrees in science and technology, and t h e number o f 
communities trained in and hav ing access t o in fo rma t ion and communications technologies. 

43. 

Mega-projects. Mega-projects, inc lud ing M o z a l Aluminum I and 11, and the Southern 
A f r ica gas pipeline, are estimated to contribute about 1.6 percentage po in ts to GDP growth 
annually. This contribution w i l l l i k e l y increase as a number o f proposed mega-projects come o n 
stream, including: t h e M om a Heavy Sands titanium mine, wh ich starts p roduc t ion in 2007; the 
Moatize coal mine; and t h e power plant and transmission l i n e associated with Moatize. Further 
large projects in the energy sector are under preparation, inc lud ing the Mphanda N k uw a hydro- 
power project and a gas-fired power plant in Temane in t h e South. Furthermore, M o z a l i s 
planning to bu i ld a third a lum inum plant. Several large international mining corporations are also 
analyzing investment opportunities in the mining sector. W h i l e these mega-proj ects are expected 
to continue to make major contributions to g row th and foreign exchange earnings, the i r impact 
on loca l employment i s likely t o be re la t ive ly l im i ted a f ter t h e construction phase. T o increase 
their impact in this regard, i t i s important to develop SME linkages as has been done by Moza l .

Private Sector Development. Development o f t h e p r iva te sector, inc lud ing helping f i rms 
move f r om t h e in fo rma l sector to t h e formal sector, w i l l be essential t o increasing and sustaining 
growth and employment generation. Two key PARPA I1 objectives that w i l l help promote broad- 
based g row th are increasing support t o SMEs, and p romo t ing t h e tou r ism sector. S M E s and t h e 
tourism sector h o l d greater promise fo r broad-based g row th as they help develop the domestic 
private sector, generate employment and develop the ru ra l economy, and they can be a n effective 
way to link the fo rma l and in fo rma l economies. 

45. 
Regional Integration and Trade. Increasing domestic and international trade underpins 
Mozambique's g row th strategy. Emphasis needs to be placed o n regional integration t o leverage 
economies o f scale and to resolve public goods issues. Because o f the size o f the i r economies, 
human resource pools and especially, the H I V / A ID S crisis, n o southern A f r i c a country can 
generate high rates o f g row th re ly ing on ly o n domestic resources. Mozambique - like i t s 
neighbors - has particular in te res t in regional initiatives to s treng then inter-country transport, 
energy markets, use o f international water, communications, f o o d security, and trade financial 
and customs systems. M o r e generally, SADC members have defined t h e i r priorities over the next 
decade to be: (i) trade liberalization, inc lud ing the creation o f a Customs U n i o n by 2010 and t h e 
establishment o f a common market b y 2015; (ii) financial harmonization, 
inc lud ing the 
establishment o f a fbll monetary un ion by 2016; (iii) development o f regional infrastructure t o 
facilitate trade, communications, and energy trading and r i s k management; and (iv) management 
o f pub l ic health issues, especially HIV/AIDS. 

Business Environment, Governance, and PARPA 11 Interventions. Second-generation

reforms imp rov ing the investment climate, re fo rm ing t h e lega l and j u d i c i a l sector, imp rov ing 
public financial management, increasing the quality and quantity o f pub l ic services through 
re fo rm o f the pub l ic administration, decentralization, and a vigorous fight against corruption are 
essential to maintain high g row th rates and reduce poverty in Mozambique. At the same time, 
institution-building, especially at the local level, needs to accelerate, combined with better resu l ts 
monitoring, and intensified efforts to increase citizens' participation in a l l aspects o f pub l ic l i f e 
as t h i s w i l l increase the demand for accountability at the loca l level. These institutional and 
governance reforms need to complement the investments in infrastructure and social services; 
otherwise, their impact wou ld be rather limited. 

47. 
A business environment unfriendly to small and med ium enterprises and the in fo rma l 
sector has hampered g row th in bo th urban and ru ra l areas. There have been some improvements 
- e.g., due to recent legal reforms (adoption o f a new Commercial Code and L a w o n Company 
Registries) and electronic business registration, the process t o set up a firm i s expected t o 
decrease to on ly 35 days in 2007 ( f rom 153 days in 2005 and 11 1 in 2006) - but much remains to 
do; Mozambique was ranked 140 out o f 175 countries in t h e D o i n g Business indicators in 2006.'' 

48. 
The labor market i s an area in wh ich significant re fo rm i s awaited. At present, it i s 
extremely rigid, and i s considered to be among the ten mos t restrictive globally." The j u d i c i a l 
process also remains cumbersome and complex, and case resolution i s slow, pa r t icu la r ly in t h e 
labor courts. E f fo r ts are underway to improve contract enforcement, inc lud ing t h e creation o f

commercial sections in the jud ic ia l tribunals, but poor contract enforcement continues t o 
discourage private sector investment. Such hurdles in t h e bus iness environment have contributed 
t o the growing prevalence o f systemic corruption, w h i c h the 2003 Investment Climate 
Assessment flags as one o f t h e major impediments to growth. Recognizing th is , PARPA I1 
contains targets to simplify the process o f starting a business, simplify impo r t and export 
procedures, approve and implement a new labor law, and limited measures to strengthen the 
capacity o f t h e jud ic ia l system. 

49. 
Inadequate access to finance has hampered the growth o f SMEs, especially in ru ra l areas. 
Factors behind t h i s include h i g h in te res t rates, presence o f secure government investments, 
absence o f competition among banks, and weak repayment and collateral enforcement. M a n y o f 
the on ly 29 percent o f registered companies that have loans o n the i r books have no t used fo rma l 
financial sector in termed iar ies . These factors account fo r this sector’s small and fa l l ing 
contribution to GDP o f a l i t t l e above 3 percent in 2006. T h e W o r l d Bank Do ing Business su rvey 
ranked Mozambique 143 out o f 178 countries o n ease o f getting credit for 2006. PARPA I1 
includes goals t o improve the performance o f banks, increase access t o microfinance fo r ru ra l 
communities, and increase the amount o f loans to the private sector. 

50. 
Limited administrative capacity at t h e loca l leve l also hinders rural grow th and l im i t s 
demand fo r accountability. D is t r ic t and p rov inc ia l governments are imp rov ing their ab i l i ty t o 
stimulate investment in community service delivery projects. However, they have ye t t o 
demonstrate significant capability or structure t o help organize activities at the loca l leve l t o 
stimulate private sector investment. In general, smallholder fa rme rs need support t o organize 
themselves in associations that leverage t h e i r bargaining power (e.g., relative t o large industrial 
farming en terpr ises in outgrower schemes) and share productivity-enhancing agricultural 
technologies. The limited capacity o f loca l government and community organizations also 
impedes t h e demand for accountability at t h e loca l level, a major shortfall in the governance 
framework. PARPA 11’s ru ra l development strategy foresees developing economic and financial 
development agencies and agro-livestock associations, and imp rov ing ru ra l communication. 

Governance and Accountability 

51. 

Mozambique’s governance framework i s in transition; i t s system o f pa r t ic ipa t ion and 
accountability i s s t i l l young and evolving, and ins t i tu t ion building i s in the early stages. Yet, 
Government’s goal o f broad-based growth w i l l be impeded i f current weaknesses in the 
governance framework are no t addressed. Further, increasing pub l ic dissatisfaction with the 
po l i t ics o f patronage and clientelism pose a risk to the nascent democratic system and t o long - 
t e rm po l i t ica l stability. 

52. 
The W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te ’s Governance Matters survey data shows that in 2005

During 2005 and 2006, €our studies have strengthened government and development 
partners’ understanding o f issues affecting governance?’ These analyses have shared the 
following conclusions: 
* Corruption i s common in parts o f the public sector and in service delivery. In the public 
sector, corruption i s more common than elsewhere among the police, the court system, 
customs, business licensing, and tax collection. Petty corruption i s common in service 
delivery, including in education, health, water and electricity. and other public services that 
capture revenues, Ma in forms o f corruption are bribes and kick-backs. Among large 
infrastructure and transport projects, the re i s a perception that corruption has been associated 
w i th contract negotiations and procurement processes. 
Mozambique perfoms relatively we l l in the areas o f budget formulation and execution. 
However, the 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment 
indicates that weaknesses continue in: accounting and audit, especially external audit: cash 
management and monitoring o f expenditure payment arrears; 
transparency in the 
procurement process; revenue collection, especially o f the corporate tax base; internal 
controls for non-salary expenditure and effectiveness o f payroll controls; and, predictability 
in the availability o f funds for commitment o f expenditures. (See Box 4.) 

20 These are: (i} the 2005 Worfd Bank Institute Anti-Corruption Survey; (ii) the 2006 DFID Strategic Conflict 
Assessment; (iii) the 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment; and (iv) the 2006 USA ID 
Corruption Assessment.

The increasing single party dominance o f a l l three branches o f t h e State weakens checks and 
balances. Parliament that does no t have an effective opposition and t h e jud ic ia ry i s no t 
considered to be independent. 
C i v i l society organizations, t h e media, and loca l commun i ty organizations are often no t 
strong and so have l im i t e d voice and participation in po l i t ica l and legislative processes?1 
W h i l e Government i s gearing up i ts anti-corruption efforts, there have so far been few 
repercussions fo r those who a re corrupt. As i t i s now receiving more resources, t h e Anti- 
co r rup t ion O f f ice (GCCC) i s increasing the prosecution rate f o r corruption cases. (See

Access to justice i s often beyond t h e reach o f the average Mozambican, especially in ru ra l 
areas. Log is t ica l challenges limit the geographical reach o f t h e courts. Community courts - 
the most visible face o f justice for much o f Mozambique - receive l i t t l e support f i om the 
state. Private lawyers’ services are priced well beyond the reach o f the average citizen. 

Box 3. Mozambique’s Public Financial Management 

T h e 2005 Pub l ic Expenditure F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty (PEFA) assessment rev iewed Mozambique’s pub l ic f inanc ia l 
management systems a t the end o f 2004. I t found: 
Overall, Mozamb ique pe r fo rmed w e l l in the areas o f budget fo rmu la t ion and allocation. T h e budget i s a cred ib le 
and rea l is t ic instrument tha t i s generally implemented as intended. Budge t allocations have been consistently in 
l ine w i t h sector po l ic ies and PARPA objectives. Budge t execu t ion is, o n average, close t o the i n i t i a l l y approved 
allocations, but there i s s t i l l weak capacity o f Government t o mob i l ize l o c a l counterpart f i n d i n g f o r fo re ign

(Development partners have since improved the ir repor t ing o n p ro jec t and program aid. and the use o f na t iona l

Mozamb ique scores p o o r l y o n indicators for: oversight o f aggregate f isca l risk f i o m other pub l ic sector entities; 
extent o f unrepor ted government operations; and transparency o f inter-governmental f isca l operations. 
High l e v e l o f tax exemptions (particularly 
f o r mega-projects) and non-compliance of, and s ign i f ican t 
ine f f ic ienc ies in, tax enforcement limit expansion o f the tax base and revenue collection. In 2005, the revenue 
re fo rm process has focused e x p l i c i t l y on im p r o v i n g tax enforcement. 
T h e aud i t func t ion s t i l l requires s ign i f ican t attention, i n c l u d i n g expand ing the l im i t e d coverage o f ex terna l

Transparency in procurement i s weak. Less than h a l f o f contracts above the na t iona l threshold fo r sm a l l

policy-based budgeting, cash management, comprehensiveness and transparency o f budget management, and 
revenue co l lec t ion and management. The next PEFA assessment i s scheduled f o r 2008.

In response to these findings, the Government o f Mozambique prepared an Anti- 
corruption Strategy for the period 2006-2010, approved by the Counc i l o f M in is te rs in April 
2006. The strategy’s principles include: zero tolerance, emphasis o n prevention, p romo t ion o f 
investigation o f cases, and citizens’ participation. T h e Na t iona l A n t i -C om p t i o n Plan was 
approved b y the Council o f Ministers in February 2007. This plan includes sector anti-corruption 
plans f rom several 
a results framework, and institutional arrangements for 
implementation. The Inter-Ministerial Commission for Public Sector Reform, chaired by the 
P r ime Minister, i s charged with p rov id ing po l i t ica l leadership fo r the implementation and 
mon i to r ing o f the Anti-Corruption Strategy; a Technical Commission and An t i -co r rup t ion 
Forums (at national, p rov inc ia l and district levels, integrating representatives o f c i v i l society, the 
pub l ic sector and the private sector) have also been established. The Technical Commission i s 
empowered to oversee, mon i to r and implement t h e strategy and t h e forums se rve as consultation 
mechanisms. PARPA I 1 also includes actions fo r imp rov ing transparency in the budget planning 
and implementation process, and fo r increasing citizen access to in fo rma t ion concerning pub l ic 
resources and service delivery. (The pillars and focus areas o f PARPA I1 a r e presented in B o x 5.) 

55. 

During the last CAS period (2003-7), the W o r l d Bank Group and development partners 
helped raise the p ro f i le o f governance concerns. IDA and others o f the G18 focused general 
budget support on imp rov ing the supply side o f t h e governance framework, inc lud ing pub l ic 
financial management systems and pub l ic sector reform. A l though implementation o f agreed 
changes has been slower than expected, especially in c i v i l service reform, progress in these 
p r io r i t ized areas has been steady. However, development partners and Government have done 
less o n the demand side o f good governance, and the re has been g row ing realization that more 
e f fo r t i s needed to increase citizen demand fo r accountability. 

56. 
Development partners have collaborated to address governance issues in l i n e with t h e i r 
comparative advantages. Fo r example, 
the Netherlands and FA0 focus o n land and 
environmental management. Denmark has supported the modernization o f the legal framework 
and imp rov ing the quality o f the jud ic ia ry through training; recently, along with t h e European 
U n i o n and Ireland, i t also has supported audits o f the justice sector. Sweden and Ireland have 
focused o n pub l ic financial management and audit systems; the former has p rov ided support t o 
the audit section o f the Administrative Tribunal. T h e European U n i o n has focused o n electoral 
systems. The European U n i o n and U N D P have also supported institutional strengthening and 
re fo rm in the justice sector. One o f UNDP’s m a i n p r io r i t ies i s strengthening t h e c r im ina l jus t ice 
and prison systems. The UK and I re land a re p rov id ing funding fo r non-governmental and c i v i l 
society organizations to improve governance more generally. 
IDA w i l l contribute t o t h e 
development o f baselines fo r key outcomes in the Anti-Corruption Strategy results framework 
through the recently restructured Public Sector Re fo rm Project, and w i l l coordinate a second 
Anti-corruption Survey t o check progress against the 2004 Survey results. 

57. 
As Mozambique i s a diverse and large country, t h e po l icy direction taken by Government 
towards decentralization can help foster pub l ic accountability 
to citizens by bringing 
Government closer to the people. Currently, municipalities are t h e on ly truly decentralized 
en t i t ies ; mayors and c i ty councils are elected. Districts and provinces are s t i l l centrally-controlled

Box 4. PARPA J I Pillars and Focus Areas 

Unlike the sectoral approach in P AR P A I, PARPA I1 uses a pillar approach based o n t h e f ive-year government 
program. PARPA I1 has t h r e e m a i n pillars, a foundation o f macroeconomic and p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, and 
e i g h t cross-cutting topics. 
P i l l a r O n e - Governance : P AR P A I1 sets ou t a broad and amb i t ious agenda o f ins t i tu t iona l re forms in pub l ic 
administration, p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, decentralization by devolution, 
the j u d i c i a r y sector, and anti- 
corrup t ion measures. These are t o be complemented b y increasing popu lar pa r t ic ipa t ion a t t h e l o c a l level, focusing 
o n the d is t r ic t and mun ic ipa l i ty as t h e k e y unit o f service delivery. T h e re forms in p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion w i l l inc lude 
a census o f a l l c i v i l servants, the fo rmu la t ion o f a new salary po l icy , and h n c t i o n a l analysis o f t h e k e y m in is tr ies t o 
prov ide better services. Decen tra l iza t ion r e f o rm includes the devo lu t ion o f some func t ions t o the d is t r ic t 
administration, an increase in the number o f mun ic ipa l i t ies w i t h elected c i t y governments, a n d a re th ink o f in ter- 
governmental f isca l re la t ions and resource transfers t o loca l governments. Re fo rms in the j u d i c i a r y sector w i l l 
address ine f f ic ienc ies and lack o f capacity in the administration o f jus t ice w i t h the ob jec t ive o f making jus t ice m o r e 
accessible. Key elements o f the an t i-corrup t ion strategy inc lude the reduc t ion o f r e d tape, increased transparency in 
pub l ic f inanc ia l management and access t o in fo rma t ion by the public, and strengthening o f ins t i tu t ions tha t 
prosecute corruption. 
P i l l a r Two - H u m a n C a p i t a l : Improvemen ts in human cap i ta l w i l l be sought th rough in terven t ions in the soc ia l 
sectors and infrastructure. K e y ob jec t ives inc lude the reduc t ion o f c h i l d and ma terna l mor ta l i ty , a lmos t doub l ing the

ratio, increasing access t o d r i n k i n g water, and expanding social pro tec t ion programs. P AR P A I1 adopts a ho l is t ic 
v i ew towards human development and s k i l l s development by, inter alia, a t tach ing impor tance t o technical and 
vocational t ra in ing and ter t iary education. PARPA I1 further iden t i f ies science and techno logy as a cross-cutting 
p r i o r i t y sector. 
P i l l a r T h r e e - E c o n om i c Deve lopmen t : Th is pillar addresses the improvemen t o f the investment climate and 
remov ing k e y constraints t o grow th . Re forms and measures under t h i s pillar are a imed at: (i) macroeconomic 
management; (ii) imp rov ing the business environment; (iii) development o f the f inanc ia l system; (iv) p romo t ing the 
creation o f a strong, dynamic, competitive, and innova t ive pr iva te sector; (v) p r om o t i n g the p r i o r i t y sectors, 
broadening the business class, and creating j o b s ( inc lud ing in agriculture and agrarian services, na tura l resource

although deconcentration o f 
functions and 
responsibilities has begun. 
In 2007, 
provincial assemblies w i l l be elected fo r t h e f i r s t time. T h e gradual empowerment o f district 
governments and loca l consultative councils, as well as PARPA 11’s objective o f increasing the 
number o f municipalities, w i l l enhance citizen participation in government. Legislation approved 
in 2004 made districts a budget entity, and requires approval by d is t r ic t consultative councils o f 
budgets. C r i te r ia adopted in 2007 increase t h e proportion o f investment budget t o be executed by 
district governments. A comprehensive decentralization approach by the ma jo r sectors i s s t i l l 
needed; i t w i l l help ensure effective allocations o f functions, finances and human resources fo r 
local service delivery, and therefore help improve service delivery. 

5 8 . 

Despite t h e achievements o f decentralization, s low progress in institutional and c i v i l 
service re fo rm undermines the efficiency o f pub l ic institutions and t h e i r accountability t o the 
public. W h i l e organizational reforms are underway in several m i n i s t r i e s and within t h e c i v i l 
service in general, progress has occurred at a slower pace than expected. Preparatory measures to 
reform the c i v i l service and pave t h e way for salary re fo rm have been taken, inc lud ing the 
creation in 2006 of the National C i v i l Service Authority, implementation o f a c i v i l se rvan t 
census, and development o f the C i v i l Servan t Register. In l igh t o f concerns relating to leadership 
and program content, the scope o f the Public Sector Re fo rm Program (Phase 2, FY03-10) has 
been narrowed, with a greater focus on i t s impact o n service delivery. Notwithstanding these 
actions, the lack o f progress o n the re fo rm o f the administrative framework raises fundamental 
issues about h ow to e l ic i t the best performance out o f c i v i l servants, and risks undermining c i v i l 
se rvan t accountability to t h e public. 

11. THE BANK GROUP STRATEGY: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH 

59 . 

The new strategy o f the Wo r ld Bank Group t o support t h e development o f Mozambique 
over 2007-1 1 w i l l employ an integrated approach that stresses poverty-reducing growth, 
collaboration with development partners, focus o n cross-cutting themes, mainstreaming 
governance and capacity development, and focus o n results. These operating principles build o n 
lessons f r om t h e implementation o f the 2003-7 strategy. They are also in l i n e with the pillars 
stressed in the Wo r ld Bank Group’s Af i ica Action P l a n presented to the Boa rd o f the W o r l d 
Bank o n M a r c h 20, 2007: Accelerating Shared Growth, Building Capable States, Sharpening 
Focus o n Results, Strengthening the Development Parherhips. 

Building on Lessons Learned

60. 
A discussion o f lessons learned f r om the previous CAS implementation i s at Appendix 6. 
T h e ma jo r lessons relevant fo r the new strategy are: 
Understand better the country’s po l i t ica l economy and reflect in the design of studies and 
projects. Po l i t ica l economy factors are central t o the stalled implementation o f several 
projects and some non-lending initiatives, and a re k e y to effective development in general. 
Po l i t ica l realities should be taken in to account in the t im i n g and content o f projects. 
A t ten t ion has to be paid to h ow po l i t ica l economy factors impact government ownership o f 
projects. 

- 20 - 

a Effectively address recurrent portfo l io issues, especially counterpart fund ing and VAT 
refunds. Two issues that a re closely linked to t h e po l i t ica l economy and to the country's 
financial management system a re counterpart funding and VAT refunds. L a c k o f counterpart 
funds has hampered the implementation progress o f several projects in the po r t fo l io during 
the last three years; and slow or insufficient VAT refunds t o contractors has resulted in 
higher costs fo r infrastructure projects and projects that invo lve building o f pub l ic works. 
The Bank Group w i l l consider these issues in h t u r e project designs, as well as he lp 
Government address weaknesses in related budget and financial management systems. F o r 
the current and new portfolio, 100 percent financing w i l l be used as permitted in Bank 
guidelines and where ownership i s no t an issue . 
Art icu late the Bank G roup 's requirements rega rd ing country systems re la ted to f inanc ia l 
management, procurement and audits, and wo rk w i th Government and development pa r tne rs 
to develop a capacity development p l a n for these areas. This step i s required in accordance 
with the Paris Declaration but i t i s also necessary to accommodate plans fo r t h e greater use o f 
sector wide approaches and common fund arrangements. Several attempts to j o i n common 
fund arrangements in the past have been unsuccessful in terms o f Bank invo lvemen t (while 
others have worked). In addition to assessing the current state o f government procurement 
and financial management systems against Bank Group requirements, t h e Bank Group w i l l 
help Government draft a capacity development plan fo r these areas to address capacity gaps, 
especially for district administrations. A t ten t ion w i l l also be paid to enhancing t h e 
participation o f the loca l populations, in planning and budgeting, and in ensuring 
transparency and accountability in the use o f pub l ic funds at that level. 
M o r e realistic targets for the Bank strategy (CPS), and distinguishing of PAF targets (of the 
broader group of development partners) versus CPS targets. Because o f the challenge o f 
attribution, PAF targets should on ly be selectively included in t h e CPS results framework, 
e.g., i f they are triggers in t h e PRSC series, o r i f t h e Bank Group program i s the m a i n source 
o f support for achieving the target. 
Simpler design and better p ro jec t p repa ra t ion 
to ensure a f i t w i t h government 
implementation capacity, as we l l as to reinforce government capacity. Project design i s 
often overly complex. Available capacity needs to be an important des ign criterion. 
Similarly, projects need to: use project preparation facilities to ensure implementation 
readiness; reduce t h e creation o f parallel project implementation units and give more 
responsibilities t o l i n e m in is t r ies ; and include govenunent procurement and financial 
management s ta f f as part o f the preparation team. Projects also need to plan fo r more realistic 
implementation t ime f rames and rap id start-up. Stronger preparation and implementation 
readiness (through dialogue and relationship building) are also key to an effective po r t fo l io . 
Coord inate capacity bu i ld ing efforts across the Wo r ld Bank G roup w i t h Government a n d 
w i th development partners . Bank s t a f f need to develop an overall strategic framework fo r 
capacity building, in coordination with development par tners and Government. Important 
considerations in t h i s are: (i) capacity building needs and gaps (especially at the sub-national 
level), (ii) capacity needed for engagement in any field, and (iii) interventions aligned to 
available capacity. Finally, results measurement fo r capacity building needs t o be improved. 
Improve coordination and dissemination of ana lyt ic wo rk . h a l y t i c a l and advisory w o r k 
conducted during the CAS pe r iod have been relevant and of high quality. Their findings a r e 

- 2 1 - 

used to in fo rm subsequent project design and po l icy dialogue. Improvements can be made, 
however, in the collaborative selection o f topics and t h e design o f j o i n t wo rk programs, 
timing, and dissemination. Ana ly t ica l wo rk must also be unequivocally demand-driven. 
0 Address governance issues in all operations. Corruption in service delivery and procurement 
processes (even where activities are not using Bank funds) undermines the performance o f 
Bank Group operations and t h e i r impact on poverty alleviation. Strategies t o be pursued by 
the Bank Group to address t h i s issue include: mainstreaming c i t izen scorecards q d other 
local accountability mechanisms (as done by Decentralized Planning and Finance (Cr. 
H0670) and ProMaputo (Cr. 42570)); and pu t t ing in place sector governance and 
accountability frameworks (as done in Roads and Bridges (Cr.35500) and National Water 
Development I1 (Cr. 32470)), and capacity development in f iduc ia ry areas. The 
implementation o f t h e procurement code, inc lud ing at the district leve l , w i l l be monitored. 

Valued Partnerships 

61. 
Partnership with Government. The Government o f Mozambique values Bank Group 
support. I t has indicated that projects garner greater support within Government and 
communities where the re i s involvement o f t h e W o r l d Bank Group. The knowledge, capacity 
building and influence generated b y the Bank Group’s po l icy dialogue, analytical and advisory 
services, and lending support i s recognized, as i s IDA assistance pa r t icu la r ly in t h e areas o f 
education, health, and infrastructure, The Bank Group also offers significant combined resources 
fkom IDA, IBRD, IFC, and MIGA to support private sector development. Other competencies 
that are especially valued include expertise in financial management, procurement, expenditure 
management, resource mobilization, poverty diagnostics, and results management. 

Partnership with Development Partners. T h e Bank Group’s r o l e as a convener o f 

62. 
development partners and catalyst fo r re fo rm i s generally appreciated, and the increasing 
presence o f s t a f f in Mapu to enhances t h e Bank Group’s ab i l i ty to pe r fo rm these functions. A l l 
development partners and Government deserve credit for hav ing s ign i f ican t ly advanced the 
harmonization agenda in Mozambique and fo r having successfully implemented best practice 
coordination mechanisms, inc lud ing fo r p rov id ing general budget support, implementing Paris 
Declaration objectives, and general coordination o n assistance strategies. 

63. 
A Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) was signed in 2004 between Government and 
the development partners p rov id ing general budget support (G18 Program Aid Partners). Tw o 
fundamental principles o f t h i s M o U are predictability and alignment with the domestic budget 
cycle. Support fo r t h e upcoming year i s based o n t h e assessment o f a “Joint Review” o f the 
previous year, conducted among the development partners and Government, wh ich looks at 
government performance against an agreed performance 
framework 
( the Performance 
Assessment Framework, or “PAF”). The M o U also indicates that disbursements fo r general 
budget support can be interrupted i f Government does no t pursue certain undertakings, inc lud ing 
macro-economic stability and commitment to sustainable pove r ty reduction. 

64. 
Additional progress has been made in implementing the Paris Declaration fo r the 2006 
and 2007 budget cycles (see Appendix 9 ) , especially facilitated by t h e development o f 
mechanisms to b r ing p ro jec t a id on-budget (e.g., the Medium-Term F isca l Framework, and a 

- 22 - 

project database and website listing support f rom a l l development partners). Previously, 
development assistance had not been factored in to resource allocation decisions, an issue that 
undermined the principle o f comprehensive budgeting. In addition, development partners have 
set 2010 targets for Paris Declaration indicators. Since t h e 2005 rev iew o f t h e performance of t h e 
Program A i d Partners, the Wo r ld Bank Group has been making progress against most o f these 
targets. Notably, the W o r l d Bank Group i s focusing o n increasing the number o f j o i n t missions 
and j o i n t analytical work, and reducing t h e number o f PIUs. T h e W o r l d Bank Group i s also 
p rov id ing support to Government in financial management and procurement t o facilitate t h e use 
o f country systems. 

65. 

Development partners have aligned their support to the PARPA I1 and have j o i n t l y 
agreed wh ich donor(s) w i l l take lead responsibility in each focus area, building o n their 
comparative advantage. Appendix 2a l i s t s the PARPA I1 areas o f focus o f each partner and 
Appendix 2b provides a full l i s t o f participants in the respective wo rk ing groups. F o r example, 
among France’s focus areas are health and the environment; Italy’s are pub l ic financial 
management and budget management and agriculture; 
the Netherlands 
focuses o n 
decentralization, education and health; Denmark o n mun ic ipa l development and justice systems; 
Switzerland o n water and sanitation and governance reform; Germany o n pub l ic financial 
management and the financial sector; the European Commission on electoral systems, the 
jud ic ia l sector, agriculture and health; Ireland o n pub l ic sector reform; the FAO, IFAD, and 
Sweden o n agriculture; USA o n governance, service delivery, the environment and private sector 
development; t h e UK o n private sector development, the financial sector and transport; and t h e 
A f r ica Development Bank o n financial sector and infrastructure development. 

66. 

The benefits o f the growing collaboration among development partners and with 
Government are evident. Better reporting o f project expenditures by development partners has 
resulted in getting most external a id flows on-budget, wh ich facilitates budget management. 
Increased j o i n t missions and j o i n t analytical w o r k are placing less o f a burden o n government 
counterparts, and helping to 
improve product quality and service delivery efficiency. 
Collaboration in the development o f country strategies i s helping Government address resource 
gaps in the implementation o f PARPA 11. At the same time, coordination and harmonization i s 
time-consuming, and significant wo rk remains. 

67. 

Emerging partners such as the Government o f China, the US Millennium Challenge 
Corporation, and private foundations (such as t h e C l in ton Foundation and t h e Gates Foundation) 
are changing t h e development context in Mozambique. The risks and opportunities presented by 
these emerging partners have significant implications fo r the W o r l d Bank Group’s business 
model. During t h e CPS period, the Bank w i l l continue t o explore ways o f enhancing i t s business 
and operational models t o improve effectiveness in t h i s new context. Accessing the entire range 
o f products available across the Wo r ld Bank Group - national and regional IDA resources, IFC, 
MIGA, IBRD partial r i s k guarantees, carbon financing and various t r u s t funds, inc lud ing the 
G loba l Environmental Facility, and so o n - as well as systematically exp lo r ing co-financing 
opportunities with development partners i s a s tar t . 

68 . 

Partnership with C iv i l Society and the Private Sector. The Bank G roup w i l l continue t o 

strengthen i t s wo rk with c i v i l society organizations and the private sector, bo th t o facilitate 

- 2 3 - 

g row th and good governance and to strengthen demand fo r accountability. Regular consultations 
are planned with c i v i l society organizations, inc lud ing NGOs, think tanks, and academic 
institution, and private sector players. The Bank team w i l l consult with these partners during the 
design, implementation and supervision o f s tud ies and operations, as appropriate. The advice o f 
these partners was sought during the development o f t h e CPS (see Appendix 3). 

69 . 

As deeper partnering with c i v i l society and the private sector, and a focus o n citizen 
accountability and voice, are relatively n ew areas for t h e W o r l d Bank Group in Mozambique, the 
Bank team w i l l be look ing to l e a r n f rom development partners who have been more active in t h i s 
area, and f rom W o r l d Bank Group experiences in other countries. Bank s t a f f wo rk ing with 
Mozambique are in touch with t h e i r colleagues in the external relations unit to develop an 
outreach and knowledge dissemination strategy, and with the W o r l d Bank I n s t i t u t e (MI) and 
the social development unit to mainstream social accountability mechanisms in the portfolio. 
Other activities to a similar end under discussion include: building the capacity o f c i v i l society 
organizations and t h e media to monitor government; using c i t izen scorecards and surveys to 
invo lve citizens in planning and mon i to r ing pub l ic service delivery; and wo rk ing with 
Government to increase citizens’ access to in fo rma t ion o n the budget, procurement procedures 
and transactions, service delivery costs, and users ’ r i g h t s .

Partnership with Other Countries. In the longer term, Mozambique’s continuing 
development w i l l depend significantly o n t h e country’s v is ion for t h e ro le that i t should p lay in 
Sub-Saharan A f r ica and in the larger international context. As a re la t ive ly small country with 
correspondingly small market power and resources, Mozambique’s longer-term growth strategy 
needs t o be built o n i t s comparative and strategic advantages and complementarities within 
southern Africa. As mentioned in paragraph 45, Mozambique w i l l seek t o partner with other 
countries, especially with neighbors in southern Africa, to implement t h e Southern A f r ica 
Development Community (SADC) priorities, deal with pub l ic goods and transboundary issues, 
and t o strengthen inter-country 
transport, energy markets, use o f international water, 
communications, food security, and trade financial and customs systems, and t o deal more 
effectively with HIV/AIDS. During the nex t fou r years, the W o r l d Bank G roup w i l l wo rk with 
Government to help explore and take advantage o f such regional integration and g row th 
opportunities, especially relative to neighboring countries and SADC .

Guiding Principles f o r a New Partnership Strategy: Collaborate - Focus - Deliver 
71. 

Three key overarching principles will guide Bank Group s ta f f w o r k i n g o n Mozambique 
during t h e CPS period. These are: Collaborate - Focus - Deliver. 
Collaborate. T h e new Country Partnership Strategy w i l l s t r ive t o achieve significant 
impact, be cost-effective, and ensure sustainability o f reforms, capital investments, and capacity 
building efforts. In t h i s regard, ne i the r Government no r t h e Bank Group can a f fo rd to act alone. 
In addition to collaborating with Government and the partners l i s t e d above, the Bank w i l l 
continue to collaborate with neighboring Bank country departments to leverage our combined 
knowledge and human resources to imp rove our efficiency and effectiveness, inc lud ing t h e 
department wo rk ing with South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Madagascar 
and Mau r i t ius on the one hand, and that responsible fo r Tanzania and Uganda o n the other.

73. 

D raw ing upon t h e lessons o f the previous CAS, t h e new strategy w i l l emphasize a 
programmatic and cross-sectoral approach. T o leverage the Bank Group’s support, t h e strategy 
w i l l also favor activities that are linked to a larger program that i s supported by multiple 
development partners. Each Bank Group project preparation team w i l l seek to include as relevant 
specialists f rom IDA, IFC, MIGA and WBI, in order to systematically explore collaboration 
opportunities across the Bank Group. Similarly, the Bank w i l l exp lo i t opportunities f r om global 
and bilateral development partner programs and other Bank Group resources, inc lud ing regional 
initiatives such as the A f r ica Catalytic Fund and the A f r i c a capacity b u i l d i n g program, CDMAP ; 
global programs such as t h e Carbon Fund and t h e G loba l Environmental Facility; and Bank 
Group global products such as guarantees. 

74. 

Focus. T h e Bank Group recognizes Government’s 
leadership 
in coordinating 
development partners. I t also recognizes that t h e country’s needs well exceed what the Bank 
Group can provide in te rms o f advice and financing. 
I t will, therefore, continue to consult 
extensively with Government and with development partners to i d e n t i f j areas where the Bank 
Group can u t i l ize i t s comparative advantage. Fo r example, other development partners are taking 
the lead in the areas o f primary education, food security, and environmental management, while 
the Bank Group w i l l increasingly focus o n institutional reforms, and infrastructure and ru ra l 
development. A recent example o f leveraging non-traditional resources t o enable the use o f IDA 
resources in other less-funded areas (in t h i s case, water resource management) i s t h e linkages 
established with the M i l l e n n i um Development Corporation and the A f r i c a Catalytic G row th 
Fund to support the expansion o f water supply programs through the F Y 0 7 Water Services and 
Institutional Support Project. 

75 . 

Deliver. In order to help Government achieve PARPA I1 outcomes, t h e Bank Group w i l l 
aggressively address poo r po r t fo l io performance, incorporating lessons lea rned f r om t h e CAS 
Completion Report (Appendix 6). Realistic outcomes w i l l be defined fo r a l l interventions - 
through strengthened and s imp l i f ied project design. Rigorous results mon i to r ing w i l l help ensure 
that implementation o f the strategy i s on track. This w i l l also require attention to planned resu l ts 
during project design. Required changes to the po r t fo l io due t o performance issues or to 
unexpected changes in t h e operating environment w i l l be addressed qu ick ly and proactively with 
the range o f instruments and resources available within the Bank Group. T h e Bank Group i s 
redefining criteria fo r t h e use o f country systems to accelerate the harmonization o f financial 
management, procurement and auditing procedures among partners and Government. 

76. 
The Bank Group w i l l continue to invest in demand-driven analytical and advisory 
activities (AAA), drawing f r om i t s global knowledge and international experience. T h i s non- 
lending support encompasses: economic and sector work, wh ich underpins our po l icy dialogue 
with the client as well as lays the foundation fo r effective lending; and technical assistance that 
can be f lex ib ly used t o enhance capacity and help Government implement reforms. In some 
sectors or themes, analytical and advisory activities w i l l f o rm the sole source o f support f r om the 
Bank Group, as financing f rom other development partners are leveraged. AAA w i l l be 
organized around t h e three ma in pillars o f t h e strategy, and w i l l re f lec t the need to: address 
knowledge gaps and deepen understanding in particular areas; facilitate po l icy dialogue; and 
provide greater support for government programs, as may be requested. To this end, outputs w i l l 
be tailored to t h e particular issue and audience. Hence, in some cases t h e Bank Group w i l l need 

- 25 - 

to be particularly agile and responsive, drawing upon global knowledge to provide just-in-time 
advice. At other times, more comprehensive analysis w i l l be required. Incorporating lessons 
learned f rom the previous CAS period, where the poor dissemination and supply-driven nature o f 
some AAA were problems, the fo l low ing principles have been defined fo r AAA wo rk : 
L i s t e n to the client t o understand the i r needs for technical assistance and t o help them address 
key knowledge gaps, and ensure genuine demand for specific activities. 
Identify up f ron t the intended impact of t h e activity, and specify h ow t h e baseline and results 
w i l l be measured. 
Coordinate closely with Government, academic institutions, and development partners t o 
leverage resources and promote synergies, idea l ly as j o i n t products. ’ 
Ensure that the key stakeholders are invo lved in shaping the emerging ‘findings f i o m the 
earliest stages, and that dissemination i s jus t one part o f the consensus building process. 
Exp lo i t the range o f Wo r ld Bank Group resources in the preparation, implementation, and 
dissemination o f AAA, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank I n s t i t u t e and the access o f fe red by the 
G loba l Distance Learning Network. 

77. 

Th is more integrated approach has already begun in FY07 (see Box 6 fo r one example). 
Sector wide approaches and common funds w i l l be expanded to increase synergies and reduce 
transaction costs fo r the client and partners. Country systems w i l l also be u t i l ized fo r t h e same 
reason, although in some areas this w i l l require significant increase in country capacity. Budget 
support w i l l be provided through PRSCs in l i n e with the Paris Declaration, G18 targets and 
W o r l d Bank Group gu ide l ines . Annual p r io r i ty objectives defined with development par tners 
w i l l be included as indicative triggers in the PRSC series wh ich w i l l comprise approximately 40 
percent o f t h e IDA financing envelope i f P A F targets in the core governance areas are achieved. 

Box 5. The Bank Group’s Engagement Principals at Work 

Preparation o f the Maputo Municipal Development Program (ProMaputo) in FY07 illustrates the Bank Group’s 
engagement principles at work. ProMaputo a ims to strengthen the capacity o f Maputo Municipality (CMM) in 
governance, planning, financial management, and service delivery. I t also addresses cross-cutting priorities o f 
Government and the Bank Group, including enhanced accountability, combating corruption, promoting public- 
private partnerships, and addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Citizen report cards and community participation in 
planning and budgeting, both linked to a comprehensive municipal communication strategy, w i l l increase CMM 
responsiveness to c iv i l society concerns. Increased transparency, administrative reform, and systematic audits w i l l 
contribute to reduced corruption in municipal management. With the support o f PPIAF, Maputo w i l l pilot public- 
private partnerships as an option for leveraging i t s limited fmancial and management capacities to improve priority 
services. For HIV/AIDS, the municipality w i l l implement a workplace program supported by the National A ID 
Commission (CNCS). 
During program preparation, systematic consultation o f municipal interest groups, including low-income community 
residents, local political representatives, NGO/civil society leaders, private sector and public utility managers, and 
central government officials, ensured that ProMaputo both responds to and engages the contributions Maputojs key 
social, political, and economic stakeholders. A comprehensive institutional reform and capacity building process 
based on mainstreaming program activities in permanent municipal units for strategic planning, procurement, 
revenue administration and expenditure control w i l l ensure CMM leadership, ownership, and the sustainability o f 
governance and management improvements. Service improvement benchmarking, participatory monitoring and 
periodic citizen report cards w i l l serve to maintain the program’s performance focus as emphasis gradually shifts 
Eom institutional reform and strengthening in terna l capacity to i ts ultimate goals: achieving better l iv ing conditions 
for Maputo’s poor communities and more dynamic growth among the city’s businesses.

Lending and Non-Lending Strategy 

78 . 

I n line with these engagement principles, the overall goal o f t h i s Country Partnership 
Strategy i s t o promote shared growth within the context o f the country’s o w n development 
strategy (PARPA 11). The strategy encompasses three pillars, corresponding to the PARPA I1 
pillars. P i l lar I, Increased Accountability and Public Voice supports PARPA 11’s Governance 
pillar. Pillar 11, Equitable Access to Key Services, supports objectives under PARPA 11’s Human 
Development pillar. And, Piliar 111, Equitable and Broad-based Growth , supports PARPA 11’s 
Economic Development pillar. An overview o f the major objectives and outcomes defined 
each pillar i s included below. Five major resu l t areas have been defined encompassing 18 
development outcomes. The Results Framework i s at Appendix 1. A l l CPS outcomes support 
key outcomes in PARPA 11. T h e indicative lending program i s listed in Appendix 4a (with 
possible Bank Group financing sources at Appendix 4b). Appendix 5 l i s t s IDA interventions 
since 2000, and also shows current operations that w i l l be active during t h e CPS period.

79. 

The formulation o f CPS objectives and outcomes took into account PARPA 11, t h e PAF, 
the MDGs, Paris Declaration indicators, IDA-14 requirements, the World Bank Group’s Africa 
Action Plan (AAP), and the programs and priorities o f other development partners. The drivers 
o f growth selected for the CPS align with the flagships o f the Africa Action Plan, namely (i) 
strengthen t h e African private sector; (ii) increase the economic empowerment o f women; (iii) 
build s k i l l s for competitiveness in a global economy; (iv) ra ise agricultural productivity; (v) 
improve access to and the reliability o f clean energy; (vi) expand and upgrade road networks and 
t r a n s i t corridors; (vii) increase access to safe water and sanitation; and (viii) strengthen national 
health care systems and combat malaria and HIV/AIDS.

The PRSC se r ies w i l l closely support outcomes in t h i s pillar. Indicative triggers include: 
maintaining expenditures for p r io r i ty sectors in budget planning and execution in l i n e with the 
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework; expanding the ro l lou t o f basic functionality o f e- 
SISTAFE t o a l l ministries and districts; increasing the capacity o f the Central Revenue 
Authority; increasing the number o f central and p rov inc ia l l e v e l bodies with operational internal 
controls; increasing the number o f financial audits; increasing government revenues; and 
increasing the disposition o f court cases. Triggers to support milestones in decentralization (e.g., 
implementation o f t h e Na t iona l Decentralization Strategy) and to 
implement the new 
procurement system at the district leve l , w i l l also build t h e capacity o f district-level government. 

82. 

Three other existing programs and two planned programs support Government’s pub l ic 
sector re fo rm program and decentralization strategy: 

0 The Pub l ic Sector Reform Pro ject (Grant H024 -MOZ ) i s an existing program that seeks to: 
improve the organizational efficiency o f selected pub l ic sector institutions at central and loca l 
levels through restructuring the ministries; s treng then pub l ic sector capacity in t h e areas o f 
planning and financial management, inc lud ing procurement (implementation o f e-SISTAFE 
at t h e central, p rov inc ia l and district levels i s key to achieving t h i s objective); support the 
T r ibuna l Adm in istrat ivo (TA)23 in undertaking audits fo r the central, provincial, and district 
governments; improve access to and the quality o f selected p r i o r i t y pub l ic services; improve 
legal and jud ic ia l services in selected provinces; and, imp rove the qua l i ty and ava i lab i l i ty o f 
statistical data fo r pub l ic and private sector needs. T h i s project was restructured in F Y 0 7 to 
improve performance and to add the Legal Services component. 
The f i rs t phase (APL1) o f the Mapu to Mun ic ipa l Deve lopment P rog ram (ProMaputo, Cr. 
42570) began implementation in FY07. T h i s program seeks t o build the capacity o f the 
Maputo mun ic ipa l government to better deliver pub l ic services. A second phase (APL2) i s 
planned to deepen t h e reforms in i t ia ted in A P L l .

T h e Na t iona l Decentra l ized P lann ing and F inance P rog ram , a multi-donor operation, w i l l 

scale up to a l l districts the current IDA and partner program, Decen t ra l ized P lann ing and 
F inance P rog ram (Cr. H0670), wh ich supports capacity building o f selected districts in 
finance and budget management. A SWAP w i l l be explored fo r t h e fo l low -on program. 

83. 

Ana ly t ica l and advisory activities that w i l l support t h i s pillar comprise th ree main 
thematic areas, First, analytical wo rk to examine the mechanisms fo r loca l government financing 
and accountability and assessing mun ic ipa l development w i l l support Government’s 
decentralization program. T h e analysis o f mun ic ipa l development in Mozambique, inc lud ing 
lessons learned f rom IDA’S recently-closed operation (Mun ic ipa l Deve lopment - Cr.35490), w i l l 
help in fo rm whether IDA should support a fo l low -on national mun ic ipa l development operation. 
Second, the use o f pub l ic resources at t h e sector leve l (e.g., in health, education, agriculture, 
water, and infrastructure), w i l l be examined j o i n t l y with Government and t h e G18 partners 
through sector-specific Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys . A value-for-money audit o f t h e 
justice sector (also with some other development partners) w i l l give fu r the r i n s i g h t s and 
recommendations i n t o the effective use o f pub l ic resources. An assessment o f the new 
procurement system (with OECD and G18 partners) and a second Public Expenditure Financial

Accountability Assessment (also j o i n t l y with some G18 partners) will provide an update on t h e 
key pub l ic financial management reforms. T h e E SW w o r k o n procurement (FYO8) will be 
similar to a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) assessing what stage t h e 
procurement system has reached, defining performance indicators (based o n O E C D D A C 
methodology), and proposing t h e mon i to r ing system to be put in place. T h i s ESW w i l l be based 
o n extensive consultation with Government and development partners. In addition, the Bank 
Group w i l l wo rk with Government to develop a capacity development plan fo r procurement and 
financial management, inc lud ing for district governments, as discussed in paragraph 60. Third, a 
program o f analytical wo rk and technical assistance w i l l help s treng then t h e governance 
framework. T h i s w i l l include: governance assessments o f sectors in wh ich the Bank i s engaged 
and the use o f these findings to inform Government’s An t i -Co r rup t ion Plan; a legal and j u d i c i a l 
review led by the European Commission and the Netherlands ( jo in t ly with t h e G18); and 
technical assistance t o improve pub l ic demand fo r accountability, 
inc lud ing activities to 
strengthen media, N G O and community organization oversight o f government activities, build 
the capacity o f community institutions, and institutionalize citizen feedback mechanisms.

Treatment Acceleration Project (Grant No . H1040) are p rov id ing support t o Government’s 
HIV/AIDS strategy by building the capacity o f the national HIV/AIDS secretariat, CNCS, 
and by increasing access to treatment. A fo l low -on HIV/AIDS SWAP i s planned to p rov ide 
further support to CNCS and to put in place sustainable implementation arrangements. T h e 
poss ib i l i ty o f implementing a Southern A f r i c a Regional H I V / A I D S Program with 
neighboring countries w i l l be explored. H I V / A I D S interventions w i l l also be mainstreamed

the IFC-supported model fo r assistance to SMEs with HIV/AIDS education programs. T h i s 
initiative, wh ich has been successfully launched, raises awareness o f private sector 
employees and S M E s to issues related t o H IV /A IDS . 
A SWAP planned to support Government’s Hea l th Service De l ive ry Program (HSDP) w i l l 
provide financing t o implement an integrated service delivery strategy that focuses o n c h i l d 
and maternal health and that involves facility-based services, outreach, and community-based 
care. Government wou ld s ta r t scaling up services in the northern provinces that generally 
have less access to healthcare and poorer hea l th indicators, and then expand gradually south

as financing becomes available and experience and capacity improve. Also, in t h e scope o f 
the HSDP the Bank will provide assistance to t h e M i n i s t r y o f Hea l th t o imp rove i t s planning 
systems including the planning o f investments and the medium te rm expenditure framework 
that should guide p r io r i t iza t ion and spending in accordance with the existing resource 
envelope. A possible Regional Hea l th Worker T ra in ing Program w i l l a l l ow Mozambique to 
collaborate with neighboring countries to leverage economies o f scale and cross-country 
learning in the t ra in ing o f health workers. 
Tw o existing IDA projects support higher education objectives. T h e H ighe r Education 
Project (Cr.36090) aims to improve equitable access to and quality o f higher education. The 
Technical, Vocational Education and T ra in ing Project (Cr. 41 560) aims t o improve access 
and quality o f technical and vocational education. A fo l low -on higher education project 
focusing on imp rov ing s k i l l s in science and technology i s planned t o support the goal o f 
imp rov ing the quality o f higher education. 
The existing Na t iona l Water Development Project I1 (Cr. 32470) and the proposed F Y 0 7 
Water Services and Institutional Support Project a im to expand access t o urban water and put 
institutional arrangements in place t o facilitate increasing access to ru ra l water. Add i t iona l 
financing f rom the A f r ica Catalytic G row th Fund, Program o n Output-Based Aid, and 
Millennium Challenge Corporation have been leveraged for t h i s program. 
The recently restructured Energy Re fo rm and Access Project (Cr.38 190), with financing 
f rom t h e Global Environmental Facility, w i l l build solar photovoltaic systems in schools, 
clinics and administrative posts in ru ra l areas in order to increase access t o sustainable energy 
for these ru ra l institutions (as w e l l as increase household connections). A planned fo l low -on 
project (Phase 2) will pursue similar objectives during t h e latter years o f the CPS period. 

85. 
Analytical and advisory support fo r the objectives o f th is pillar will include an update o f 
t h e Benefit Incidence Analysis using national household survey data, and a series o f Beneficiary 
Assessment Surveys to gauge t h e leve l o f user satisfaction with service provision. These su rveys 
and benefit analysis, together with sector expenditure reviews discussed in Pillar I, w i l l help 
Government f ine - tune pub l ic sector reforms to further improve service de l ive ry and to ensure 
that pub l ic funds reach the i r intended targets. IDA w i l l also undertake specific poverty and 
social impact analyses o f major reforms planned by Government. This w i l l include continued 
wo rk o n t h e Poverty Social Impact Analysis, w h i c h looks at the impact o f the 2005 abo l i t ion o f

Activities in t h i s p i l la r support tw o major resu l t areas: Enab l ing Internat iona l and Loca l 
Investments and Strengthening Economic Growth Potential. Significant investments to unleash 
t h e potential o f the ru ra l economy, improvements in the investment climate, and M h e r second 
generation institutional reforms are required to achieve the nine outcomes and t h e objective o f 
sustained shared growth. T h e partnership strategy w i l l support second generation reforms and the 
removal o f binding constraints t o growth by financing investments in infrastructure, ru ra l 
development, business climate, and regional integration. These investments w i l l help lay t h e 
foundation fo r sustainable and broad-based growth. Deepening and broadening t h e private sector 
w i l l create jobs and generate significant resources fo r development, inc lud ing tax revenue, wh ich 
combined w i t h improved tax administration, could improve Government’s f isca l pos i t ion and 
thus reduce dependence o n development partner assistance. Other ma jo r po l icy areas that 
require attention are regulatory reforms in key sectors, such as transport and energy, the financial 
sector and labor market po l icy . A lso important w i l l be greater collaboration with neighbors o n 
trade, transport, energy, water resource management, communications, and HIV/AIDS. 

87. 
The rational and sustainable development o f natural resources, inc lud ing b y mega- 
projects, could: (i) a l low increased spending on poverty alleviation and the MDGs ; (ii) 
significantly augment Mozambique’s and the region’s electricity supply; (iii) a l low imp roved 
control o f water f lows o n the Zambezi and other international rivers (with bene f i ts fo r f lood 
control, power generation, agriculture and aquaculture, and urban and ru ra l water supply); and 
(iv) protect the enviro&ent. 

88. 

The PRSC ser ies and eleven current (including FY 0 7 pipeline) and thirteen planned 
operations, inc lud ing fou r t o five regional operations, support the nine outcomes in Pillar 111: 
0 A private sector development program w i l l incorporate fo l low -on objectives to the ongoing 
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Program (FSTAP) (Cr. 41320) and the recently closed 
Enterprise Development Program (Cr. 33170), and w i l l focus o n p romo t ing business 
development services and access to finance f o r SMEs and o n imp rov ing t h e business 
environment. The program w i l l build on IFC’s programs fo r SMEs, especially in t h e area o f 
promoting access t o finance through innovative products and risk-sharing mechanisms, and 
expanding business opportunities for SMEs through linkages with mega-projects. The 
program w i l l target key sectors and w i l l focus o n broadening support beyond the Mapu to 
area. 
Finally, the program w i l l support Government’s efforts at re fo rm o f the business 
environment, as outlined in t h e G o M Strategy fo r Imp rov ing the Investment Climate. 
Mozambique w i l l also seek t o j o i n the Regional Trade Fac i l i ta t ion Program, wh ich promotes 
private sector development and trade by p rov id ing po l i t ica l and commercial risk instruments. 
T h e IMF and IDA have been advising Government on imp rov ing i t s fiscal regime fo r mineral 
resource and petroleum projects, and on financing o f mega-projects, especially fo r hyd ro - 
power. The W o r l d Bank Group has been supporting, and w i l l continue t o o f fe r support for, 
such projects t o enhance the benefits fo r t h e host country and ensure adherence t o high 
environmental and social standards. A technical assistance operation (potentially regional) 
w i l l support the p rov is ion o f high quality advisory services and capacity building in t h e m a i n 
ministries invo lved with infrastructure (e. g., Energy, M ine ra l Resources, Transport and 
Communications, Public Works and Tourism).

project and t h e Regional Communications Infrastructure Program. T h i s regional program 
supports populations and businesses across eastern and southern A f r i c a t o have access t o 
qua l i ty and affordable telecommunications services. T h e fo l low -on Communications project 
w i l l continue to support increasing teledensity, increasing sustainable ru ra l access t o I C T - 
based services, especially i n t e r n e t services, and increasing the number o f central, p rov inc ia l 
and loca l government institutions connected to the e-Government network. 
The recently restructured Energy Re fo rm and Access Project aims t o expand access to energy 
fo r households and rural institutions (such as schools and clinics), and re fo rm the ins t i tu t iona l 
and regulatory framework fo r the energy sector. The FY 0 7 regional Malawi-Mozambique 
Interconnector Project (Southern A f r ica Power Poo l APL2 ) w i l l expand energy trading 
opportunities fo r bo th Mozambique and M a l aw i with SAPP member countries. Tw o f o l l ow - 
o n energy projects w i l l focus on energy generation transmission and distribution fo r bo th 
domestic and industrial use, as well as continuing support fo r sector re fo rm and ove ra l l 
improved quality o f service. IDA w i l l also wo rk with I F C to address t h e energy needs o f the 
mega-projects, including those connected with t h e Moa t ize coal project. IDA w i l l also 
collaborate with I FC to address t h e energy needs o f t h e mega-projects, e.g., through Pa r t ia l 
Risk Guarantees. 
In addition, IFC i s ready to consider investments in t h e Be i ra ra i lway and Be i ra and Naca la 
ports that a re part o f the ongoing IDA Be i ra Ra i lway (Cr. 39910) and Ra i lway and Ports 
Restructuring (Cr. 32880) projects. IDA and MIGA w i l l continue to o f fe r po l i t ica l risk 
guarantees that support private investments across multiple sectors. Increasingly, IDA, I F C 
and MIGA w i l l wo rk more closely together, and at an early stage, o n large infrastructure 
projects in order t o help optimize their developmental impacts. IDA w i l l also rev iew 
accessing carbon financing funds. Output-Based Aid w i l l also be accessed fo r additional 
financing. Finally, IDA w i l l collaborate with GEF to update i r r iga t ion infrastructure and 
improve efficient water resources management in rural areas and Maputo. 
IDA’S successful leadership o f interventions in the roads sector date back t o the early 1990s. 
T h e recently closed Roads and Bridges APL 1 (Cr. 35500) helped r e f o rm the ins t i tu t iona l 
and regulatory framework fo r the sector as well as rehabilitate the road network. T h e F Y 0 7 
fo l low -on A P L 2 project w i l l continue to support the sector strategy through the development 
o f a SWAP and continue to rehabilitate and maintain more o f the road network. APL 3 i s 
planned fo r the end o f the CPS period and w i l l continue to support the sector strategy. 
Support to two major regional transport co r r ido r opportunities (Nacala and Mtwara) w i l l also 
be considered. Development o f the former w o u l d l i k e l y invo lve Mozambique, M a l aw i and 
Zambia, and the latter, Mozambique, Tanzania, M a l aw i and possibly Zambia.

Anchor Investment Program, a collaborative in i t ia t ive with t h e Ministry o f Tourism that aims 
t o identify, develop and promote three “Anchor Investment S i tes” in different zones fo r t h e 
development o f quality tourism, as well as t o mob i l ize funds fo r infrastructure development 
and to create a positive image o f Mozambique as a tou r ism and investment destination. I F C

The regional F Y 0 7 GEF-funded Western Indian Ocean Ma r ine H ighway Development and 
Marine Contamination Prevention Project will increase the safety and efficiency of 
navigation in the Western Indian Ocean by establishing a marine h ighway to guide ships 
around environmentally sensitive areas and through selected busy sea lanes, and b y 
supporting development o f capacity fo r po r t safety monitoring. 
T h e Wo r ld Bank Global Fac i l i ty for Disaster Reduction and Recovery Mu l t i -Dono r Trust

multi-sector, multi-stakeholder process 
t o mainstream risk reduction and disaster 
management; an investment framework for hazard prevention, mitigation, and preparedness; 
and an ex-ante disaster recovery financing mechanism.

Several cross-country integration opportunities are under consideration, including: t h e 
FY07 regional Malawi-Mozambique Interconnector Project (Southern A f r i c a Power Poo l APL2), 
Western Indian Ocean Ma r ine H ighway Development and Marine Contamination Prevention 
Project, the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program, the Regional Trade Fac i l i ta t ion 
Project, t h e Regional Health Worker T ra in ing Program (discussed in P i l la r II), a regional 
HIV/AIDS project (discussed in P i l la r II), and one or bo th o f tw o ma jo r transport corridor 
opportunities (Nacala and Mtwara). Regional integration projects re f lec t intense and often 
d i f f i c u l t multi-country coordination. W h i l e their potential bene f i ts are tremendous, t h e 
transaction costs are high. Thus, t h e Bank Group w i l l need to be selective in supporting such 
initiatives; strong ownership b y a l l relevant countries w i l l need to be a c r i t ica l criterion. 

90. 

Analytical and advisory activities under this pillar will seek to deepen our understanding 
o f the sources o f sustainable and shared g row th and the determinants o f poverty, as well as the 
development o f policies to enhance productivity and competitiveness. Ou r AAA w o r k w i l l 
include a Country Economic Memorandum that analyzes constraints t o economic g row th and 
poverty reduction and an integrated country poverty, social and gender assessment. This w i l l be 
complemented by an update o f the Investment Climate Assessment, an analysis o f labor markets, 
and further analysis o f ru ra l poverty dynamics. T h e status o f the financial sector, and t h e 
measures to improve long-term finance and access to finance for SMEs in rural areas, w i l l be t h e 
focus o f additional AAA. A second Financial Sector Assessment Program w i l l also be 
conducted, j o i n t l y with the IMF. To better understand the costs o f building and ma in ta in ing 
infrastructure in ru ra l and urban areas, as well as to ga in a better appreciation o f regional 
transport opportunities, a baseline study o n t h e fiscal cost o f infrastructure w i l l be conducted; 
t h i s w i l l be part o f the A f r ican regional flagship study fo r the Bank. Analysis w i l l also continue 
o n the management and exploitation o f natural resources, b o t h to maximize the long-term fiscal 
benefits fo r Mozambique but also t o ensure environmentally sustainable resource use. Th is w i l l 
include support fo r the preparation o f a national water resource strategy. F ina l ly , we w i l l support

t h e 2007 census and the 2008/09 national household expenditure survey, wh ich w i l l provide 
insights o n poverty, as well as i n f o rm the preparation o f Government’s nex t five yeai plan. 

91. 
Cross-Cutting Themes. Reflecting t h e th ree cross-cutting themes, a l l W o r l d Bank Group 
operations w i l l systematically: (i) explore and support applicable HIVIAIDS interventions; (ii) 
promote t h e participation of the private sector; and (iii) tackle relevant capacity and institution- 
bu i ld ing aspects, inc lud ing in collaboration with other development partners. Capacity bu i ld ing 
at the local leve l w i l l be p r io r i t ized t o maximize support t o Government’s decentralization 
agenda. The W o r l d Bank Group w i l l wo rk with development partners and Government t o 
establish an ove ra l l framework to guide interventions in each cross-cutting theme. T h e integrated 
frameworks w o u l d exploit synergies and comparative advantages o f each development partner, 
help advance harmonization, and increase the efficiency and effectiveness o f interventions in 
these areas. T h e Bank Group A f r i c a capacity development initiative, CDMAP , and t h e W o r l d 
Bank I n s t i t u t e w i l l help facilitate the development o f a coordinated capacity development 
strategy; attention w i l l go to results measurement and mon i to r ing capacity bu i ld ing initiatives. 

92. 
To p rov ide intellectual underpinning o f these cross-cutting themes and to gain a better 
understanding o f t h e constraints and opportunities fo r new and existing operations, Bank s ta f f 
and development partners w i l l continue to rev iew the implications o f Mozambique’s po l i t ica l 
economy for the design and implementation o f operations. 

Resources to Implement the Strategy 

93. 
T h e IDA allocation i s performance-based, t h e amount o f financing being significantly 
influenced b y government performance (discussed below). Assuming progress under t h e 
performance framework relative to other IDA beneficiaries - and, importantly, an IDA15 
replenishment broadly comparable to I D A 1 4 - t h e annual financing available to Mozambique i s 
expected to remain similar over the FY08 -11 period at approximately $155 m i l l i o n . T h i s i s 
similar to the $680 m i l l i o n over four years allocated under the 2003-7 CAS. (Appendix 7a l i s t s 
IDA commitments, disbursements and repayments during the FY04 -07 period.) Given the results 
o f the 2006 I D A A M F j o i n t Debt Sustainability Analysis, Mozambique i s expected to receive 
financing in the f o rm o f credits rather than gran ts , 

94. 
T h e Bank Group’s presence in Mozambique has expanded and with planned recruitments 
and decentralization transfers, should be adequate t o implement the program outlined in t h i s 
strategy. At end-FY07, the country o f f ice w i l l employ 12 international staff and 28 national 
s ta f f , Sectors that have task team leader representation in t h e Country O f f ice include 
communications, energy, water and sanitation, agricultural and ru ra l development, health and 
HIV/AIDS, and poverty reduction and economic management. S k i l l s in financial management 
and procurement have also been reinforced, inc lud ing to support Government in i t s pub l ic 
financial management reforms. An internationally-recruited Senior Operations O f f ice r recently 
jo ined the o f f ice as Mozambique Country Program Manager. T h e I FC o f f ice in Maputo, wh ich 
was reopened in 2004, n ow comprises th ree international s t a f f and 14 loca l s ta f f , covering the 
areas o f investments, technical assistance and SME finance.

R i s k s t o the Strategy 

95. 

H I V / A ID S poses the most formidable r isk t o Mozambique’s development. The 
devastating effects o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic threaten Mozambique’s growth potential in many 
ways. 
I t s adverse impact o n beneficiaries, the social fabric, c i v i l service capacity and labor 
productivity i s already obvious. Failure o f leadership t o b r ing about behavioural change w i l l 
have an adverse effect o n PARPA I1 and CPS implementation. 

96. 

In addition, governance problems pose t h e other significant risk t o t h e strategy. 
Increasing one-party dominance poses a risk to the development o f the nascent democracy, and 
may limit public accountability, citizen voice and participation. 

97. 

Notwithstanding the observation made in the previous paragraph, elections also pose a 
r isk t o the implementation o f the program outlined in t h i s partnership strategy. Elections fo r 
p rov inc ia l assemblies w i l l be held in 2007, mun ic ipa l elections in 2008, and national presidential 
and parliamentary in 2009. W h i l e elections oblige a government to show resu l ts b y a certain 
date, they may also delay d i f f icu l t decisions fo r second generation reforms, particularly around 
the time o f national elections, as happened in 2004, the year o f the last national elections. 
Revenue collection as a percentage o f GDP also dropped in that year. However, b o t h the revenue 
generation and the pace o f reforms came back o n track in 2005 and accelerated in 2006. T h e 
election cycle w i l l require bo th attention and a sense o f realism about the t im ing o f reforms. 

98. 

Inadequate fiduciary controls and a failure t o strengthen pub l ic financial accountability 
mechanisms could result in increased corruption, wh ich w o u l d undermine government c red ib i l i ty 
and private-sector confidence and possibly prompt development partners to w i thho ld support. 
Moreover, a lack o f transparency in the jus t ice sector w i l l erode investor confidence. 

99. Mozambique i s also vulnerable t o exogenous shocks. Weather-related shocks, as vividly 
illustrated by t h e 2005 drought and early 2007 floods and cyclone, are temporary in nature and 
can be somewhat ameliorated with exceptional assistance. T h e Country Team i s also wo rk ing 
with the Global Fac i l i ty fo r Disaster Reduction & Recovery Mu l t i -Dono r Trust Fund t o put 
emergency management systems in place. Terms-of-trade shocks are also temporary in nature 
and require qu ick po l icy responses. Third, there are external private investment decisions that 
have a significant macro-economic impact and can be similar to external shocks. Mega-projects 
are such investments. These also require adequate po l icy responses. 

Managing Upside and Downside R i s k s : Strategy Adjustments and Mitigation 

100. 

T h e r isks discussed above have been streamlined in the engagement framework. R i s k s o f 
exogenous shocks are generally understood t o be beyond t h e direct control o f Government, and 
their actual occurrence should in p r inc ip le justify greater commitments o f resources f r om t h e 
Bank Group in t h e f o rm o f financing and advice. R i s k s o f HIV/AIDS, deterioration o f 
governance, and po l icy reversals are more firmly within Government’s grasp, and justify a more 
nuanced approach by the Bank Group. 

- 3 5 - 

101. 
I f significant improvements or slippages occur in the core governance areas and the 
quality o f service delivery does no t improve, then the overall amount o f financing, the choice o f 
lending instruments and the sector focus w i l l need to be adjusted. 

102. The financing envelope w i l l be s t r ic t ly guided by the notional allocation under t h e P B A 
framework. 
Imp rov ing Country Performance and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment (CPIA) indicators, 
especially governance-related indicators, w i l l help Government access more IDA financing. 
L ikew ise , improved project implementation performance cou ld also increase IDA allocations. 

103. 
T h e increasing leve l o f financing through programmatic budget support (the PRSC 
series) i s a direct consequence of the Bank Group’s t r u s t in Mozambique’s own country systems. 
I f the mon i to r ing o f the use o f resources improves, and shows that they were used as intended, 
the Bank Group w i l l show a willingness to expand i t s PRSC envelope. I f current issues with 
pub l ic financial management a re no t addressed rapidly, and since donor dependency i s a 
governance issue in i tse l f , 
the Bank Group w i l l consider downsizing i t s PRSC support. 
However, the Bank Group w i l l not discount the momentum that was developed in i ts po l icy 
dialogue f rom i t s decision t o move to programmatic budget support, and w i l l adjust i t s program 
after consulting with the G18 partners, and in a manner consistent with the Paris Declaration: 

104, The sector focus of t h e programs supported by the PRSC series, as well as the investment 
project po r t fo l io w i l l need t o be reconsidered depending o n the pace o f progress in various areas 
o f t h e po l icy dialogue and improvements in country systems. Regarding t h e various 
development policies that t h e Bank supports, the Bank i s committed t o a sustained financial and 
advisory engagement i f the challenges remain and t h e authorities continue to reques t i ts 
involvement. The PRSC series and accompanying updates w i l l provide the opportunity fo r such 
stock-takings and adjustments. I f l i t t l e progress i s made in addressing fundamental governance 
issues, the Bank w i l l assign more resources (financial and advisory) t o address them - resources 
that w i l l necessarily be drawn f rom the limited envelope defined by the PBA . The Bank w i l l 
increase i t s support to the GoM ’s governance agenda through targeted financial and technical 
engagement, and our po r t fo l io management. Recurrent po r t fo l io problems such as counterpart 
funding, financial management, procurement, Government ownership o f projects, and M&E w i l l 
be more insistently addressed. T o a l low fo r t h i s contingency, operations under preparation w i l l 
identify objectives and components that can be deferred w i thou t jeopardizing the primary 
objectives and components. Sustainability o f the outcomes o f scaled-down operations w i l l be 
key, so as to be leveraged b y subsequent operations that w i l l p i c k up components that w i l l no t 
have been implemented as o r ig ina l ly contemplated. 
In deciding w h i c h development p o l i c y 
dialogue t o cut back, the Bank Group w i l l pay attention to t h e risk o f irreversible damage t o 
development prospects f r om i ts disengagement, and the pub l ic good nature o f some p o l i c y areas. 

105. To mitigate this risk, the Bank Group i s wo rk ing closely with Government and other 
development partners t o imp rove the f iduc ia ry and legal framework through: t h e PRSC series, 
analytical work, support t o pub l ic sector reform, and extensive capacity-building at national and 
sub-national leve ls o f government. 

106. The Bank Group w i l l also address fiduciary r i s k s in i t s ow n projects through smarter 
design o f projects that w i l l incorporate more stringent fiduciary safeguards. Loca l accountability 

I 

- 3 6 - 

mechanisms such as citizen scorecards and sector governance and accountability frameworks 
w i l l be mainstreamed across projects. The Bank Group w i l l also provide capacity building 
support to project s t a f f and counterparts in financial management and procurement, especially at 
the district level. Procurement and financial management reviews w i l l be conducted f o r the 
po r t fo l io during the CPPR process. Recurrent issues such as counterpart fund ing and VAT 
refunds w i l l b e more insistently addressed. Projects in problem status fo r more than six months 
w i l l be considered for restructuring and other remedial measures; those in problem status fo r one 
year may be closed to limit po r t fo l io risk. 

Conclusion 

107. The Bank Group i s look ing forward to collaborating with t h e Government o f 
Mozambique and development partners to implement the above strategy during the next fou r 
years. Wh i le adhering to the principles o f engagement defined above (focus, collaborate, 
deliver), t h e Bank Group w i l l remain flexible and responsive to Government’s needs in order t o 
implement PARPA I1 e f f ic ien t ly and effectively, and in order to address unforeseen scenarios. At 
the same time, t h e Bank Group w i l l wo rk with Government and development partners t o help 
develop and implement a long-term strategic v is ion fo r Mozambique that builds on t h e country’s 
comparative advantages and wh ich in t igh t ly anchored in accelerating shared g row th that w i l l 
benefit a l l Mozambicans.

Appendix 3. CPS Consultations - Conversations with Government, C i v i l Society, and the 
Private Sector 

Du r ing the CPS planning process, the W o r l d Bank Group consulted with Government, development partners, c i v i l 
society, the pr iva te sector and loca l governments. 

Government leaders and 18 other development partners were consulted during a series o f meetings in October, 
2006 (called CS-19 f o r Coun try Strategy 19 Partners) that a l lowed Governmen t and development partners to 
comment on each other’s strategy and to ensure synergies and gaps are addressed in plans to support PARPA 11. 

C i v i l society organizations, private sector and loca l government representatives were consulted during December, 
2006 in three locations (Be ira in the north, Nampu la in the center, and Mapu to in t h e south). T h e ma in objectives 
o f these consultation sessions were t o co l lec t participants’ perceptions on: (a) the areas o f intervention t o be 
included in t h e new strategy; and (b) the su i tab i l i ty o f the geographical approach fo r the implementation o f the 
strategy. 

The most frequently selected areas f o r WBG in terven t ion include: Agriculture, Governance, Infrastructure, 
W / A I D S , Health, Education, Water and Sanitation, Private Sector and Tourism.

Participants in general preferred that the W o r l d Bank Group focus a who le suite o f projects in selected loca l ized 
geographical areas rather than imp lemen t na t iona l projects. However, they cou ld n o t agree on wh ich geographical 
sub-regions should be selected.

Introduction 
1. 
T h i s CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses t h e effectiveness o f the FY04-07 W o r l d 
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy fo r Mozambique (Report No. 26747-MOZ, dated 
October 20, 2003). I t i s based o n reviews o f : (a) po r t fo l io implementation performance reports; 
(b) the last two Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and Aide-Memoires o f each 
project active during t h e CAS period; (c) Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) o f projects 
completed during the CAS period, Independent Evaluation G roup (IEG) Reviews o f ICRs, and 
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Reviews, where available; (d) interviews with selected client 
counterparts; and, (e) self-assessments b y t h e Country Team. The findings f r om th is assessment 
have in fo rmed the preparation o f the 2007-1 1 (FY08-11) Country Partnership Strategy. 

2. 
The FY04-07 Mozambique CAS was one o f the first results-based CASs t o be developed 
in the Bank. I t specified the CAS outcomes that wou ld support Government’s long-term 
development goals, as well as targets, milestones (intermediate indicators), and indicators used t o 
measure’ the outcomes. A s such, the task o f assessing t h e achievement o f results i s re la t ive ly 
straightforward given the availability o f reliable data. 

11. 
Government’s Strategic Goals (PARPA 2001-2005 and PARPA I 1 2006-2009) 
3. 
The CAS used as i t s basis Government o f Mozambique’s strategic goals as articulated in 
the first PRSP (called PARPA for i t s Portuguese acronym: A c t i o n Plan fo r the Reduction o f 
Poverty) drafted for the 2001-2005 period and approved by t h e Council o f M in is te rs in April 
2001. These strategic goals were grouped under th ree pillars: Imp rov ing the Investment Climate, 
Expanding Service Delivery, and Building Capacity and Accountability. 

4. 
The f i rs t pillar, Imp rov ing t h e Investment Climate, emphasized g row th through greater 
private sector investment, imp rov ing access t o financial services, lowe r ing business transaction 
costs, and imp rov ing infrastructure to enhance connectivity to markets and to increase access t o 
energy, p romo t ing sustainable u t i l iza t ion and conservation o f natural resources, and increasing 
agricultural productivity. T h e second pillar, Expanding Service Delivery, focused on reducing 
the incidence o f HIV/AIDS, reducing c h i l d and maternal mortality, increasing access to safe 
water and sanitation, increasing primary enrollment and completion rates, and e l im ina t ing gender 
and regional disparity in education. Promoting efficiency and efficacy in t h e delivery o f pub l ic 
services was also a ma jo r objective in this pillar. The third pillar, Building Capacity and 
Accountability, emphasized sound macroeconomic management, with l o w inflation, stable 
exchange rates, and increased tax revenues, financial and budget management reforms, c i v i l 
service reforms, and combating corruption.

111. Bank Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes (FYO4-07) 
5. 
The FY04-07 Mozambique CAS i s w e l l aligned with Government’s strategic goals. I t 
includes a clear resu l ts framework with measurable indicators to guide program planning, 
country performance monitoring, and po r t fo l io performance monitoring. Attachment 1 compares 
the original 2003 objectives t o the 2006 retrofitted objectives. The o r ig ina l CAS results 
framework contained 14 CAS objectives aligned t o 36 outcome indicators and 54 intermediate 
indicators. In early 2006, with indicators finalized fo r t h e Performance Assessment Framework, 
the CAS Results Framework was retrofitted to a l ign better w i th t h e P A F indicators and t h e 
indicators o f t h e A f r ica Ac t ion Plan, wh ich had then been developed by the A f r i c a Region. Some 
intermediate indicators were also reformulated to reflect t h e actual progress o f t h e po r t fo l io . T h i s 
retrofitted results framework i s included in the CAS Progress Report. The re fo rmu la t ion d i d no t 
change the development objectives nor the substance o f most indicators. However, fo r some 
outcomes, the re was confusion between CAS outcomes and national outcomes. Some indicators 
included in the results framework did no t match CAS goals but rather reflected Government’s 
national goals. T h i s no rma l ly occurred where there was no t careful distinguishing be tween P A F 
indicators and CAS indicators. 

IV . Results Assessment 
6. 
Attachment 2 provides a detailed analysis o f CAS progress and W o r l d Bank Group 
performance against the 2006 retrofitted results framework. This section s umm a r i e s these 
findings b y CAS pillar and outcome. 

Improving the Investment Climate (Pillar I) 
Outcome: Improved business environment f o r private sector 
7. 
Business environment. Mozambique i s s t i l l one o f the most d i f f i c u l t places in the w o r l d to 
do business. T h e country’s rank f o r Ease o f D o i n g Business has slipped f r om 137 in 2005 to 140 
in the 2006. The country has no t met i t s 2006 targets fo r reducing the cost and t ime required for 
registering a business, although these indicators are expected to improve s ign i f ican t ly in 2007 as 
a resu l t o f computerization and electronic publishing o f two o f the most time-consuming steps in 
the process (the publishing articles in t h e o f f ic ia l gazette and app ly ing fo r an operational 
license). Mo re problematic i s the country’s inab i l i ty to meet re fo rm targets regarding the labor 
law. Mozambique has one o f the most rigid labor markets in the world, and the most rigid in 
southern Africa. T h e new Labo r L a w approved b y Cabinet in November 200625 s ta r ts t h e re fo rm 
process but falls short o f the changes necessary to meet Government’s target o f rank ing 80* in 
t h e wo r ld fo r labor rigidity.26

8 . 

The WBG has contributed to progress in imp rov ing t h e business environment through: 
the PRSC ser ies and the Enterpkse Re fo rm Project (Cr. 33 170); key AAA inc lud ing the CEM , 
the investment climate assessment, and D o i n g Bus iness surveys; pa r t ic ipa t ion in sector dialogue; 
and TA in tax po l icy re fo rm for the mineral resources sector. A l though Government did no t meet

- 53 - 

P A F targets fo r reducing administrative barriers and fo r imp rov ing labor competitiveness, Bank 
Group performance has been satisfactory in pushing fo r reform. 

9 . 
T h e Mineral Resources Management Capacity Building Project (Cr. 34860) has been 
p rov id ing technical assistance t o G o M fo r institutional development and regulatory re fo rm 
designed to encourage the expansion o f private investment in mining in a socially and 
environmentally sound way. Implementation has been satisfactory. However, t h e outcomes o f 
th is project were no t included in t h e CAS results framework. 

Outcome: Regulation and supervision o f financial system reinforced 
10. 
F inanc ia l sector. A h i g h leve l o f government sponsorship and coordination o f financial 
sector reforms has led to good progress on implementation o f reforms in the sector. IDA support 
i s through the multi-donor Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTAP, Cr. 41 320), 
the PRSC series, and through leading t h e PAF wo rk ing group. Technical assistance i s provided 
b y the IMF. T h e Financial Sector Assessment, supported by IDA, the IMF and other donors was 
also key in preventing further financial crises during and f o l l ow i n g the liquidity crisis o f t h e tw o 
national banks in 2000. FSTAP became effective in M a r c h 2006 and implementation i s o n track 
despite slow start-up. The project’s M&E framework needs strengthening. T h e project enjoys 
good donor collaboration wh ich i s partly exemplified in j o i n t missions. An attempt at setting up a 
common fund failed, in part possibly due t o ADB and WBG internal f iduc ia ry policies. 

11. 
Private sector support. A key development objective o f IDA’S Enterprise Development 
Project (Cr. 33170) and o f IFC’s program, i s to increase access to finance and support for SMEs, 
yet outcomes related to SME finance and support have no t been inc luded in the original or 
retrofitted CAS results framework, Bank Group performance in supporting SMEs could be 
improved and scaled up. The Enterprise Development Project, wh ich closed in June 2006, 
reported better than expected outputs at project closing, especially in the areas o f linkages and 
promoting business advisory and training services fo r SMEs. However, weaknesses in M&E 
prevented systematic reporting o n actual results and impact fo r beneficiary SMEs although there 
i s anecdotal evidence t o t h i s effect. Supervision for th is project was no t vigilant, as financial 
management and internal con t ro l i r regu la r i t ies wh ich escalated in the final 18 months o f the 
project were no t flagged t o Management until near project closing. The project provided a 
p la t fo rm fo r collaboration and j o i n t experience with development partners; however, feedback 
provided to the I C R team indicates IDA could have invo lved t h e development partners more in 
t h e implementation and supervision process. Support t o SMEs p rov ided by the Bank Group has 
also come at high unit cost; the support model should be reexamined. Closer collaboration 
between I FC and IDA in sharing knowledge and resources, as planned since 2007, w i l l pa r t ia l ly 
help address th is issue. The Bank Group i s developing an appropriate strategy to respond to 
Government’s reques t fo r strengthened support in private sector development. 

Outcome: Improved delivery o f infrastructure services 
12. 
On ly one out o f four infrastructure goals has been met during t h e CAS period. T h e 
telecommunications target has been exceeded while the targets fo r roads, transport, and energy 
have on ly been pa r t ia l ly met. 

- 54 - 

13. 
Communications. Teledensity has far exceeded the CAS target o f 1.6 percent with 
teledensity actually increasing to nearly nine percent in 2006. T h i s result reflects, inter a l ia , the 
Bank’s so l id performance in supporting t h e communications sector r e f o rm agenda, inc lud ing a 
well-designed and supervised Communications Sector Re fo rm Project (Cr. 35770) (albeit, with 
some delays in project implementation). 

14. 
Transport . W h i l e restructuring in t h e roads sector fo l lows industry best practice (e.g., 
through a Road Fund, private sector participation, road safety) and has led to collection o f 
revenues above target, non-performance o f p rov inc ia l wo rks departments and procurement 
delays have l e d to h i g h cost increases and to bo th the road rehabilitation and road maintenance 
targets no t be ing met. Maintenance execution and contract management need improvement. The 
Roads and Bridges A P L 1 project (Cr. 35500) achieved the upgrading and rehabilitation o f 800 
kilometers o f road as against t h e targeted 1250 kilometers. Road maintenance i s 11,949 W y r 
(as o f June 2006) against the target o f 14,000 W y r by Dec 2006. Ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm targets 
have been achieved. The ru ra l access indicator was included in the retrofitted CAS resu l ts 
framework even though IDA support to this outcome w o u l d no t begin during the CAS period. 

15. 
IDA provided advice through t h e Roads and Bridges APL 1 project that l e d to sector 
restructuring that fo l lows industry best practice. A l though l im i t e d p rov inc ia l capacity explains 
much o f the delay in meeting project targets, part o f the cost increases are attributed t o IDA 
project design flaws associated with exchange rate risk. Other cost increases are attributed to 
government delays in processing IVA refunds, causing contractors t o increase the i r costs. 
Another lesson learned f r om t h i s project, wh ich has been incorporated in to t h e fo l low -on APL, i s 
t o enhance sustainability by developing t h e capacity o f government s ta f f rather than hiring 
consultants to do much o f the work. T h e project required extensions totaling 24 months. 

16. 
O r ig ina l CAS targets fo r international rail traffic, transport time and cost, cannot be met 
and were eliminated f r om the retrofitted CAS. T h i s poorer than expected performance i s 
attributed to several factors, including weak private sector in te res t in r a i l and po r t concessions, 
poor performance o f existing concessions, poor government mon i to r ing o f concessions, s low 
implementation o f t h e Ra i lway and Ports Restructuring Project (Cr. 32880) wh ich has l e d to cost 
overruns, and the deteriorating economic situation in Zimbabwe. The restructuring o f the 
government parastatal, CFM, however, has been proceeding as planned. IDA support through the 
Railway and Port Restructuring Project has been responsive and in accordance with sector 
policy, although the design o f the project i s complex and ambitious. T h e closing date has been 
extended by a to ta l o f 30 months, attributed to slow G o M response and procurement delays. 
17. 
Energy. The target fo r 2006 o f new connections fo r 30,000 households and 3000 c l in ics 
and schools will no t be met due to Government’s change in sector re fo rm approach just as the 
IDA-supported Energy Re fo rm and Access Project (Cr. 38190, 52650) became effective. 
Government i s no longer supporting the privatization o f the parastatal EdM but instead i s putting 
regulatory mechanisms in place to mon i to r improvements in commercial and technical 
performance at EdM. IDA did no t incorporate po l i t ica l economy considerations in to t h e design 
o f the Energy Re fo rm and Access Project; IDA approved a risky privatization strategy just 
before elections w i thou t ensuring the commitment o f t h e new Government. As a result, t h e 
project was approved in August 2003, became effective in M a r c h 2004 (the elections were in 
December 2004)’ and has been in problem s ta tus since. However, a new Senior Energy 

- 5 5 - 

Specialist based in the Country O f f ice has been wo rk ing closely with Government t o restructure 
t h e project along new Bank sector po l icy and advice. The WBG i s also advising Government o n 
f inanc ing options for t h e Cahora Bassa hydroelectric facility. 

Outcome: Sustainable management o f n a t u r a l resources 
18. 
The CAS outcome o f sustainable management o f natural resources has been partially 
met. A small po r t ion o f rural land i s covered by management plans, though these a re mostly 
forest concessions. Community level natural resource management planning has been imp rov ing 
slowly; capacity t o implement management plans at a l l levels remains low . T h e primary Bank 
Group operation in t h i s area has been t h e IDA and GEF-sponsored Coastal and Marine 
B iod ive rs i ty Management Project (IDA-33660, 3366A GEF- 23844). This project has been in 
long-term p rob lem s t a t u s and i s currently set to close in June 2007; despite a 24 mon th 
extension, a restructuring and recent improvement in implementation, the key development 
objectives have not been met (although the Strategic Development Plan fo r establishing 
conservation areas w i l l have been prepared and endorsed by M ICOA ) . The project team i s 
wo rk ing with Government to address sustainability issues. These include app ly ing lessons 
learned f rom p i l o t projects; assuring the implementation o f systems; funding and s ta f f ing fo r the 
Research Center; and implementation o f t h e Strategic Development Plan. Quality-at-entry issues 
-- lack o f assurance o f government ownership, capacity, and readiness at effectiveness -- were 
t h e source o f t h e project’s 
long-term p rob lem status. Counterpart funds and financial 
management have been recurrent flags. Bank Group AAA that contributed t o progress in 
conservation and tourism include the Coun t ry Environmental Assessment and a j o i n t EU-WB 
analysis o f M ICOA ’ s performance. IDA and GEF approved the Transfrontier Conservation 
Areas and Tourism Project (IDA-41300, 56038) wh ich became effective in June 2006. T h e 
objectives o f the project support the CAS outcome although the project outcomes and indicators 
have no t been included in the CAS resu l ts framework. 

Outcome: Inc reased use o f new f a r m technologies 
19. 
The CAS targets related to the use o f new farm technologies have been met (although t h e 
sector has met on ly two out o f the fou r targets that PAF partners track). Government has 
demonstrated commitment to imp rov ing extension services inc lud ing decentralizing the 
management o f these services. However, some major donors have pulled away f i o m sector 
support (DFID, Netherlands, Italy, USAID, IDA) due t o poor performance o f the f i r s t SWAP 
(PROAGR I I). Poor po l icy and planning, budget execution and data qua l i ty continue t o be major 
sector issues. IDA interventions in the agriculture sector include participation in t h e sector 
wo rk ing group; extensive TA and supervision fo r the implementation o f two extension 
outsourcing pilots; ES W t o evaluate the effectiveness o f public extension services; supporting 
t h e f i r s t sector SWAP (PROAGRI I, Cr. 31710) and approval o f the Market-led Smallholder 
Ag r icu l tu re Development in the Zambezi Va l ley Project during FY06 (Cr. 41980). IDA w i l l no t 
support the second phase o f the sector SWAP due to poor performance o f the f i rs t SWAP. IDA 
has been responsive in supervision and has provided extensive technical assistance as 
government sector capacity i s major impediment to progress. 

20. 
Overall, the Wo r ld Bank Group’s performance in Pillar I was moderately satisfactory. 
Qua l i ty at entry and implementation support provided to projects in the financial sector, 
communications, transport, and agriculture were satisfactory. Implementation support fo r private 

- 56 - 

sector development was not su f f ic ien t ly vigilant and therefore missed c r i t ica l financial 
management and procurement i r regu la r i t ies . Management was also no t no t i f ied in a timely 
manner to t a k e corrective action. Technical advice and po l icy support also did n o t meet client 
expectations. T h e des ign o f the Coastal and Marine B iod ive rs i ty Management p ro jec t was ove r ly 
complex, especially fo r counterparts at the loca l leve l , subjecting the project t o long-term 
problem status, even after a restructuring w h i c h also contained design flaws. IDA did no t ensure 
c l ien t commitment for the energy project wh ich also lead to the p ro jec t be ing in long-term 
problem s ta tus . Po l i t ica l economy considerations were no t adequately accounted fo r in the 
design o f th is project. 

Expanding Service Delivery (Pillar 11) 
Outcome: Reduced H I V vertical transmission from mother to child 

2 1. 
The national response t o t h e H I V / A I D S epidemic continues t o accelerate but i s s t i l l no t 
commensurate with the need. Government i s making strong efforts t o broaden i ts geographical 
coverage. IDA has provided support through the (MAP) H I V / A I D S Response p ro jec t (Grant 
No. H0300), the regional HIVIAIDS Treatment Acceleration Project (Grant No . H1040), and 
po l icy dialogue with Government in collaboration with other donors th rough the Partners Forum. 
IDA support has been instrumental to Government’s expansion o f i t s HIV/AIDS control 
program. T h e M A P HIV/AIDS Response Project provides 60 percent o f to ta l financing f o r 
H IV /A IDS . The project was a p rob lem project f r om M a y 2004 until February 2007 due to poo r 
government capacity and coordination, and inadequate Bank supervision. Add i t iona l support by 
IDA since the M id -Te rm Rev iew in February 2006 (when i t was transferred t o t h e Hea l th sector 
fo r supervision) has resulted in imp roved performance. The Bank has decided t o channel i t s 
funds with other donors through a Common Fund, wh ich w i l l reduce transaction costs fo r 
Government; however, the re have been significant delays in processing the legal amendment 
needed to that effect. 

22. 

The regional HIV/AIDS Treatment Acceleration Project received an Unsatisfactory 
overall rating during QAG’s seventh Qua l i ty at Entry Assessment fo r i t s f lawed design because i t 
was no t apparent h ow the Bank wou ld have received clear answers t o key questions o n c l in ica l 
effectiveness, impact o n health systems, and fiscal sustainability. Since t h e n t h e Bank team has 
elaborated a specific learning agenda t o address these questions. This project has p rov ided 
essential funding for Mozambique’s treatment needs. I t provides funding through th ree NGO s 
whose patients represent about 30% o f to ta l patients treated in Mozambique. 

Outcome: Improved coverage o f health services 

23. 
A l l CAS targets with respect t o health service coverage have been met. The budget fo r 
health i s increasing in absolute terms, and more i s going to t h e provinces and in a mo re equitable 
way, in l i n e with the recommendations o f IDA and development partner analytical wo rk and 
po l icy dialogue. IDA p rov ided n o lend ing support to health services during the CAS pe r iod 
(other than fo r HIV/AIDS). Indicators l i s t e d are fo r P A F partners. IDA’S recent analytical work, 
“Better Health Spending to Reach the MDGs” has been instrumental in in f luenc ing the 
government health service delivery strategy. IDA has pressed Government to use an integrated 
service delivery approach inc lud ing t h e development o f outreach services and commun i ty health 
services, in addition to facility-based services, wh ich have been the m a i n focus o f government 

- 57 - 

efforts. IDA has also urged Government t o focus o n less-served rural areas. A new Hea l th 
Services De l ive ry Program SWAP i s currently under preparation in response to Government’s 

request. 

Outcome: Sustainable increases in access to safe water 
24. 
A national indicator o f access to safe water was inc luded in t h e CAS resu l ts framework 
even though t h e CAS program only intervened in f i v e cities. Access has increased on ly 
marginally overall (current overall access i s 40.2%) but i s expected to increase significantly in 
the five cities o f the IDA project. Re l iab i l i ty o f water supplies has imp roved significantly over 
the last 18 months. The number o f connections i s expected to increase by an average 34 percent 
(to about 122,000) in the next 12 months in the IDA -p ro jec t cities. The re i s potential to serve 
over 2.4 m i l l i o n with improvements in water production made under t h e project. 

25. 
IDA’S interventions have included the Na t iona l Water I Project (Cr. 30390) wh ich closed 
in June 2005 and t h e current Na t iona l Water I1 Project (Cr. 32470, 32471). Na t iona l Water I 
achieved significant resu l ts , inc lud ing strengthening o f sector institutions, p r iva t iza t ion o f water 
management fo r five cities, and the successful p i lo t ing o f the demand-driven approach for ru ra l 
water provision. Nonetheless, Government and development partners, inc lud ing IDA, did no t 
collaborate t o ensure scaling up o f t h i s best-practice mode l after the IDA project closed. Quality- 
at-entry issues contributed to significant start-up delays. The current Na t iona l Water I1 Project i s 
expected t o dramatically increase coverage and re l iab i l i ty o f water service in the five project 
towns. Implementation progress has been satisfactory despite s low start up and disbursement, 
leading to an extension o f 24 months. 

Outcome: Increased access and quality o f primary education system, and improved quality 
o f higher education 
26. 
In the CAS period, IDA financed the Education Sector Strategy Program (1999 - 2006, 
Cr. 31720), the Higher Education Project (2002-2007, Cr. 36090), and the Technical and 
Vocational Education and T ra in ing Project (2006-2010, Cr. 41560). 
In the area o f basic 
education, ESSP was instrumental no t on ly in p rov id ing additional financing fo r basic education, 
but also for capacity building and contributing to the alignment and harmonization o f donors. 
There has been significant progress in expanding access t o a l l levels o f education, especially at 
the EP1 level. ESSP met project targets fo r gross enrollment, but data quality issues make the 
achievement o f targets fo r passing examinations and fo r repe t i t ion questionable. Primary 
completion rate remains l o w at less than 50%, posing a serious r isk to the achievement o f the 
relevant MDG by 2015. Qua l i ty o f education remains an issue. ESSP outcomes and indicators 
were no t included in the CAS resu l ts framework. 

27. 
IDA was the f i r s t donor to support the ESSP. However, there was no agreement among 
donors o n the procurement and financial instruments c r i t ica l fo r IDA financing and no legal 
framework fo r ensuring donor funding, and t h i s resulted in failure t o establish a common fund o r 
SWAP arrangement. Th is short-coming caused donor funding issues, w h i c h contributed to s ta r t - 
up delays and a complex project design, making i t d i f f i c u l t fo r IDA and Government to assess 
the performance o f the project during implementation. T h e less than satisfactory implementation 
performance o f the project during i t s early years indicates that the preparation team did no t 
sufficiently take in to account the l im i ted readiness o f project authorities to implement th is 

- 58 - 

program. Project implementation was rated unsatisfactory f rom t h e end o f 2000 to 2002. A f te r 
the project was realigned to focus o n components that required additional financing, project 
implementation was rated satisfactory. T h e closing date o f the project was extended b y 24 
months. 

28. 
T h e Higher Education Project has achieved the targets fo r three o f four key performance 
indicators, inc lud ing the internal efficiency rates, annual number o f graduates, and the 
introduction o f new degree programs. The fou r th indicator, increase by 5 percentage points t h e 
number o f students f rom the No r th and Center, was on ly pa r t ia l ly achieved. The p ropo r t ion o f 
students from the Center reached on ly 27% in 2004, short o f t h e target w h i c h was 35%. 
' Expansion at secondary l e v e l has no t been commensurate with that at the primary level. 
Secondary gross enrollment ratio i s on ly 16%, a serious bottleneck in the education system. T h e 
government fu r the r made progress in t h e p o l i c y f ron t by approving t h e ESSP 11, TVET re fo rm 
program, and the second phase o f Higher Education Operational Plan. The implementation o f 
the Higher Education Project i s o n track with a slight delay. The design o f the project has raised 
sustainability concerns as much o f the higher education directorate remains staffed by 
consultants hired under the IDA credit. T h e Technical and Vocational Education and T ra in ing 
Project on ly recently became effective (June 2006) and i ts outcomes are no t part o f the resu l ts 
framework. 

Outcome: 
Improved public service delivery planning, budgeting, and financial 
management 
29. 
Transparency o f pub l ic procurement practices that reinforced IDA interventions in this 
area include budget support through the PRSC series, t h e Public Sector Re fo rm Project (Grant 
No. H0240), the Decentralized Planning and Finance Project (Grant No. H0670), and the 
Mun ic ipa l Development Project (Cr. 35490). Deconcentration o f functions and responsibilities to 
districts has begun although a comprehensive decentralization approach to the ma jo r sectors 
needs to be undertaken in order to ensure effective allocations o f functions, finances and human 
resources fo r loca l service delivery. Criteria were defined and adopted fo r d is t r ibu t ion in t h e 
2007 Loca l In i t ia t ive Investment Budget (O I IL ) and the proportion o f investment budget t o be 
executed by district governments has increased. W o r k o n t h e inter-governmental fiscal 
framework has therefore made progress but i t s t i l l needs further e f fo r t to establish a predictable, 
stable and equitable system and to provide specific guidelines fo r execution responsibilities. The 
framework needs to be developed fo r a l l subnational en t i t ies inc lud ing provinces, districts and 
municipalities. Wo rk o n the National Decentralization Po l icy i s under way but does no t as yet set 
out specific strategies or targets. The M u n i c i p a l Development Project demonstrated that there i s 
significant wo rk needed t o increase t h e fiscal autonomy and institutional capacity o f 
municipalities to be able t o finance and implement service delivery. IDA i s wo rk ing with 
partners o n preparing a Na t iona l Decentralised Planning and Finance Programme (PPFD) to 
complement t h e budget allocations to districts as well as a multi-donor and government 
supported AAA on mun ic ipa l development. 

30. 
The Mun ic ipa l Development project was in long-term problem status until the last year o f 
t h e project. The design o f this project was also overly-ambitious especially considering the 
capacity o f municipalities. Moreover, ownership was also a problem again re f lec t ing inadequate 
incorporation o f po l i t ica l economy factors. Disbursement on the Decentralized Finance and

Planning Project has been s l igh t ly slower than planned. However, t h e p ro jec t supported 
significant progress on po l icy re fo rm and capacity development through learning by doing at the 
loca l level. M a j o r po l icy steps have been taken inc lud ing the L a w o n Loca l Organs o f S ta te (and 
i t s associated regulations) wh ich were approved in 2004 and are under implementation. These 
make the districts a budget entity and require consultative council approval. Plans have been 
prepared fo r most districts ( the P A F indicator i s fo r a l l districts supported by donors, no t on ly 
IDA) although t h e quality i s poor in many cases. The first district audits were also conducted and 
t h e Tr ibuna l Administrativo ’s institutional assessment and Corporate Plan were funded under the 
DPFP. Close supervision and realistic reporting by the IDA team has kept the project on track 
despite a d i f f icu l t po l i t ica l environment. 

31. 
Government’s s low progress in pub l ic sector re fo rm continues to raise concern among 
donors. Mos t targets have no t been met. Inter-ministry coordination and government-wide 
commitment and championship o f these reforms pose significant risk t o t h e Pub l ic Sector 
Re fo rm Project, wh ich was restructured in 2006 due to poor performance. One m a i n design f l aw 
was the installation o f a parallel P I U that competed with m i n i s t r i e s f o r con t ro l o f reforms. 
Another was that complex po l i t ica l economy considerations were no t incorporated in to t h e 
design o f the project, leading to commitment issues wh ich impacted implementation progress 
later on. 

32. 
T h e Wo r ld Bank Group’s overall performance fo r P i l la r I1 was moderately satisfactory. 
W h i l e satisfactory support was provided in the education, health and water sectors and for t h e 
DPFP project, quality-at-entry and implementation problems associated with the HIV/AIDS 
projects, t h e ESSP program, the Mun ic ipa l Development project and the Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm 
project po in t to the need for IDA to better l e a r n the recurrent lessons o f over-complexity of 
project design and inadequate incorporation o f po l i t ica l economy factors that affect client 
ownership o f projects. 

Building public-sector capacity and accountability (Pillar 111) 

Outcome: Improved budget allocation and budget execution 
33. 
IDA’S ma in ins t rumen t fo r supporting financial and budget management reforms i s the 
PRSC series. Reforms are mostly o n track. M o s t targets have been met, except fo r one: recurrent 
expenditures in p r io r i ty sectors are no t greater than expenditures fo r non -p r io r i ty sectors. Own 
revenues included in the budget are 70 percent h ighe r in real terms in 2007 than in 2006. 
External funds reporting in the single treasury account (CUT) have continually increased. Budget 
allocation in accordance with PARPA requirements (65%). Budget execution fo r 2006 o n track 
to meet PARPA target. Implementation o f e-SISTAFE has been progressing steadily i f slower 
than expected. Operationalizing e-SISTAFE at the district and mun ic ipa l levels i s n o w a p r io r i ty . 
A l though the targets fo r internal and external audits w i l l be met, the capacity o f t h e external 
auditing body, Tribunal Adrninistrativo, i s a concern as t h e body was allocated ve ry l i t t l e budget 
fo r the auditing function in 2005 and received none. The creation o f the Revenue Au tho r i ty 
f ina l ly commenced in November 2006 after significant delays.

IDA’S collaboration with the IMF on macroeconomic issues and with Program A id 
Partners in p rov id ing budget support within a clear p o l i c y framework ( t h e Performance 
Assessment Framework - a p r io r i t ized subset o f PARPA I1 Strategic M a t r i x indicators) has been 
instrumental in helping Government achieve steady targets in a sound po l icy framework. 

Outcome: Stronger M&E capability in Government 
35. 
A l l CAS targets related to monitoring and evaluation have been met. IDA support i s 
provided through the PRSC series, technical support, and donor harmonization activities. 
Government meets w i t h Program Aid Partners tw ice yearly to rev iew progress o f implementation 
o f the PES (Economic and Social Plan) and t o set targets fo r the P A R P A R A F wh ich get 
incorporated in the CFMP (Country Financial Management Plan). T h e P A F targets are annexed 
to the PES. Government has made significant progress in M&E at the national leve l , especially 
for mon i to r ing the PARPA I1 and aligning t h e PARPA I1 t o budget documents. Nonetheless, 
there has been very l i t t l e progress at t h e sector level; most sectors do not have sector results 
frameworks, and M&E capacity i s weak, especially at t h e p rov inc ia l and district levels. 

36. 
IDA has provided M&E support to G oM and development partners fo r t h e development 
o f the PARPA I1 Strategic Ma t r ix , the Performance Assessment Framework and t h e alignment o f 
IDA projects to PARPA and PARPA I1 objectives. IDA also participated in wo rk ing groups t o 
ensure consistency and alignment be tween PARPA, CFMP, PES and the OE (Budget Execution 
Report). 

Outcome: Reduced corruption 
37. 
IDA supports t h e corruption reduction objective ma in ly through t h e Public Sector 
Reform Project and po l icy support through t h e PRSC series, although a l l projects have f iduc ia ry 
safeguards in place to fight corruption at the project leve l . The ma in anti-corruption target 
relating to t h e number o f cases prosecuted, has n o t been met: the High Au tho r i ty fo r Combat o f 
Corruption did no t prosecute any cases in 2005. In 2006, however, more action has been taken 
resulting in 194 pub l ic officers expelled, 164 dismissed and 73 penalized; 249 other cases are 
due t o be concluded, inc lud ing one concerning the Director o f Prisons. The 2007 Doing Business 
Report ranked Mozambique 93rd out o f 146 countries fo r corruption. The 2004 W B I Anti- 
corruption Survey indicated that Mozambique performs worse than average fo r countries in 
southern A f i i c a with respect to control o f corruption, though better o n accountability, p o l i t i c a l 
stability and other areas o f governance. The A c t i o n P lan fo r Government’s An t i -Co r rup t ion 
Strategy was finalized in Ma rch 2007; apart f rom t h i s and some h igh - leve l events and meetings, 
implementation o f the Strategy i s about to start.. 

38. 
At t h e request o f Government, W B I provided comprehensive assistance in developing 
and conducting bo th t h e Anti-corruption Survey and the subsequent Anti-corruption Strategy. 
However, despite continuous delays in implementing the An t i -co r rup t ion Strategy, IDA did n o t 
use triggers in the PRSC t o ensure Government delivers in a t ime ly manner the resu l ts in the 
Anti-corruption Strategy, especially in t h e prosecution o f cases.

Outcome: Increased efficiency in the provision o f serv ices by the justice system 
39. 
IDA’s support for t h e justice sector has ma in ly been through t h e PRSC ser ies p lus t h e 
Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm Project. The specific outcomes associated with t h i s project are no t 
included in the CAS results framework. Instead, t h e resu l ts framework includes sector indicators. 
In the Joint Review 2006, two o f the five indicators were considered to have been met, one 
pa r t ia l ly met and the other no t met (see Attachment 2). Poor quality o f dialogue and progress in 
the justice sector poses a serious concern fo r development partners. Discrepancies in priorities, 
content, and relevance o f indicators are an issue. 

40. 
D i rec t IDA involvement in t h e justice sector started in late 2006 th rough a $5 m i l l i o n 
component in the restructured Public Sector Re fo rm Project. Though small, t h i s component i s 
expected t o achieve modest impact o n c r i t ica l activities, including: (i) build capacity and 
s treng then institutions at the provinciallappellate jurisdictions leve l ; (ii) raise awareness o f 
citizens’ r i g h t s and responsibilities through wo rk ing with c i v i l society; (iii) imp rove access to 
courts, con f l ic t resolution mechanisms, and legal services; and, (iv) provide support fo r sector 
institutions to provide outreach activities and to advance the dissemination o f legal and j u d i c i a l 
information. IDA also plans to propose supporting a system-wide in fo rma t ion and planning 
system beginning in December 2006 through the legal component o f t h e Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm 
Project, wh ich should improve the overall availability o f sectoral data. IDA has rightly been 
cautious to proceed s low ly in this area as government ownership and commitment have n o t yet 
f u l l y materialized. 

41. 
T h e Wo r ld Bank Group’s performance f o r Pillar I11 was satisfactory. Exce l len t p o l i c y 
advice and technical assistance by IDA and t h e IMF helped Government make significant 
improvements in budget management. M&E support provided by IDA was also appreciated by 
t h e client and helped improve PARPA monitoring. IDA’s support for t h e co r rup t ion outcome, 
however, cou ld be more strategic and coordinated across the portfolio. IDA did no t have an 
integrated and coordinated strategy fo r addressing corruption within the portfolio, no r did i t have 
a de f in i t ive strategic position on h o w to deal with corruption in the country. Nonetheless, t h e 
Bankwide strategy fo r governance and anti-corruption was on ly finalized recently. Finally, IDA 
cou ld have also been more decisive in i t s u s e o f t h e PRSC instrument in order to accelerate 
implementation o f t h e procurement and An t i -Co r rup t ion plans, and to imp rove compliance fo r 
P A F anti-corruption objectives (e.g. prosecution o f cases). 
World Bank Group Performance - Portfolio Management 
I D A Lending 
42. 
Portfolio Composition. During t h e FY04-07 C A S period, 12 IDA lending operations and 
one supplemental credit were approved, to ta l ing $683 m i l l ion , inc lud ing an estimated $2 15 
m i l l i o n commitment fo r FY07. Three GEF operations, with a value o f $6 m i l l ion , were also 
approved (see Attachment 3). T h i s i s in l i n e with t h e base case scenario ou t l ined in t h e CAS . O f 
t h e 12 IDA lending operations, three were PRSCs, w h i c h totaled $250 m i l l ion , or 38 percent o f 
a l l lending. Mos t o f the projects planned in the C A S were implemented during t h e latter h a l f o f 
the CAS period, during FY06 and FY07, re f lec t ing slippages in preparation; o n l y fou r projects 
were prepared on schedule. The Mapu to M u n i c i p a l Development APL (ProMaputo) was no t 
planned in the CAS and was added du r ing FY07. To ta l projects under implementation during 

V. 

- 62 - 

t h i s period averaged 21, inc lud ing two GEF projects and one regional p r ~ j e c t , ~ ’ with an average 
total commitment o f approximately $1 b i l l ion . In all, $982 m i l l i o n was disbursed f r om IDA 
credits and g ran ts to G oM during the CAS period (Appendix 7a). To ta l W o r l d Bank Group 
transfers to Mozambique during the four years o f t h e CAS to ta l $2,461 m i l l ion , along with $331 
m i l l i o n o f M I G A and IBRD guarantees and another $1,091 m i l l i o n o f H IPC and MDRI debt 
re l ie f for the IMF and the A f r ican Development Bank (Appendices 7b and 7c). 

43. 
Portfofio Age. The po r t fo l io age i s somewhat old. As o f December 2006, n i n e o f the 19 
IDA operations under implementation are at least five years old. Twelve projects (eleven IDA, 
one GEF) exited the po r t fo l io during t h e CAS period. 

44. 
Portfofio Performance. Between FY05 and FY07, three t o five projects, or one quarter o f 
the portfolio, were at risk28 at any one time, wh ich i s roughly equivalent to t h e A f r ica Region 
average. The recurrent problem projects include the MAP HIV/AIDS Response Project, the 
Public Sector Re fo rm Project, the Mun ic ipa l Development Project, the Energy and Access 
Reform Project, and t h e Coastal and Ma r ine Biodiversity Management Project. S low start-up and 
effectiveness delays were common. Start-up and implementation delays also led t o frequent 
closing date extensions. O f the 19 IDA projects currently under implementation, nine projects, or 
almost 50 percent, have had their closing dates extended, one by s ix months, two by 12 months, 
three by 18 months, two b y 24 months, and one by 30 months. S low disbursement, procurement, 
financial management, counterpart funding, and M&E are the mos t common flags raised. 

Counterpart Funding. 

45. 
Counterpart funding has been a recurrent p rob lem fo r the 
Mozambique po r t fo l io since at least 1999 when i t was flagged in some p ro jec t documents as a 
potential implementation risk. Yet, t h i s issue has continued be a ma jo r cause o f implementation 
delays fo r most projects in the po r t fo l io during FY05 and FY06.29 Counterpart funding was a 
flag for five projects under implementation in December 2006. A Bank note o n counterpart 
funding issues w r i t ten during FY 0 6 points to several causes, including: (i) the failure o f the 
M in is t ry o f Finance t o budget adequately fo r counterpart funding requirements in some projects, 
wh ich i s partly linked to the failure o f some projects to provide adequate and t ime ly data t o the 
Ministry; and (ii) insufficient commitment by G o M fo r some projects. Mozambique was among 
the th ree countries in the A f r ica Region with the h ighes t number o f flags f o r counterpart funding 
during FY05, and had t h e highest number o f such flags in FY 0 6 and FY07.30 T o facilitate 
implementation, G o M has applied fo r 100 percent IDA financing fo r selected projects. 

46. 
VAT Payments. An issue related to counterpart funding that has caused implementation 
problems i s government delay in refunding V A T payments t o contractors. T h i s delay has 
contributed to procurement delays and to some contractors ra is ing prices in order to make up for 
the loss o f V A T refunds, wh ich in turn causes cost overruns. M o s t o f infrastructure projects and 
others with c i v i l works are affected. 

27 Mapped under AFC16. 
Projects at risk include problem projects (Le., projects that have the Development Objective or Implementation 
Progress rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory or Unsatisfactory) and projects that have three or more flags raised. 
29 Many projects experienced delays related to counterpart funding but did not raise the flag. 
30 Mozambique had five projects with counterpart fund (CF) flags in both 2006 and 2007. Th e next highest number 
o f CF flags for similarly-sized portfolios was two. In 2005, Mozambique had two projects with CF flags, while two 
other portfolios had a higher number - Uganda had four and Madagascar hard three.

47. 
Design and Quality-at-entry, Only two projects were rated for Quality-at-Entry by QAG 
during the CAS period: t h e GEF Transborder Parks Project (TF-28483) and t h e Health Sector 
Recovery Project (Cr. C2788). Bo th received satisfactory ratings in a l l categories. Project design, 
however, cou ld have benefited f rom less complexity, taking i n t o account the capacity o f the 
client. In addition, implementation readiness cou ld have been better, especially in the areas o f 
procurement and financial management. Finally, the reviews found that project implementation 
wou ld have benefited from a better appreciation o f the po l i t ica l economy, inc lud ing a mo re 
realistic assessment o f client commitment. Quality-at-entry problems led t o long-term p rob lem 
status and subsequent restructurings for the Coastal and Marine B iod ive rs i ty Management 
Project, Public Sector Re fo rm Project, Energy Re fo rm and Access Project, and t h e M u n i c i p a l 
Development Project. T h e Education Sector Strategy Project was no t restructured but was in 
problem status during the f i r s t two years o f implementation. 

48. 
Closed Projects. O f the eight projects (seven IDA, one GEF) that closed b y end FY06, 
four have been rated by IEG. The Health Sector De l ive ry Project and the Second Road and 
Coastal Project received the highest ratings in a l l five performance categories (see Attachment 
7); t h e Economic Management (EMPSO) Project received t h e top ratings in th ree o f the f i v e 
performance categories, moderately satisfactory ra t ing fo r outcome and a modest ra t ing f o r 
institutional development impact; the GEF Transborder Parks Project received a satisfactory 
rating in the borrower performance category. 

49. 
Tw o projects drafted Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) during FY 0 7 but have 
no t been evaluated by IEG. T h e I C R for t h e Education Sector Strategy Project cites poor p ro jec t 
design as a major reason for project implementation to be rated unsatisfactory f r om end-2000 t o 
2002 and fo r the 24-month extension o f the closing date. The I C R fo r the Enterprise 
Development Project rated IDA Supervision Moderately Satisfactory, as financial management 
and internal control irregularities wh ich escalated in the f ina l eighteen months o f t h e project were 
not flagged to Management until near project closing. The project provided a p la t fo rm fo r 
collaboration and j o i n t experience with development partners; however, feedback provided t o the 
I C R indicates IDA cou ld have involved development partners more effectively in the 
implementation and supervision process. Recurrent lessons f r om ICRs and IEG reviews include: 
over-complexity o f design; l o w pre-implementation readiness; and poor incorporation o f p o l i t i c a l 
economy factors and assurance o f client commitment. 

50. 

IDA Non-lending 
T h e non-lending program includes 17 pieces o f analytical wo rk (see Attachment 4a), 
inc lud ing two core pieces o f economic and sector w o r k - t h e Second Public Expenditure Rev iew 
and a Country Economic Memorandum - and seven technical assistance activities. The Second 
Public Expenditure Review and the Country Economic Memorandum were completed in FY 0 4 - 
FY06, together with studies o f value chains, contract farming, 
technical and vocational 
education, health status, constraints to achieving t h e health MDG, legal and jud ic ia l status, 
governance and anti-corruption, and the poverty and social impact o f changes in primary school 
fees. The program o f technical assistance included activities aimed at strengthening capacity t o 
implement the PARPA, focusing in particular o n pub l ic expenditure management, as w e l l as

technical assistance in t h e ma in productive sectors. Technical advisories f r om I F C and MIGA 
complemented t h e non-lending program. 

5 1. 
Economic and Sector Work (ESW). E SW conducted during the C A S pe r iod have been 
relevant and o f high quality. Improvements can be made, however, in timing, dissemination, 
planning o f the output, and coordinating with Government and donors. E x p l i c i t attention also 
needs t o be pa id to ensure that the analytical w o r k i s demand-driven. F ind ings in a l l analytical 
wo rk were used to i n f o rm current or subsequent operations. Qua l i ty and peer reviews praise the 
quality o f t h e deliverables. However, slippages o f planned E SW were common (see Attachment 
4b) and (as noted during t h e 2004 Q A G rev iew o f Mozambique AAA) often resulted in 
reshuffling and a scrambling fo r funds. Some E SW products appear no t t o have been reviewed 
(or read) beyond the task team. A l though the country website posts t h e ma jo r reports, there i s n o 
central repository that keeps track o f a l l deliverables. A l though most o f t h e ESW produced have 
been demand-driven, there have been a few instances where other donors and counterparts did 
no t support the commissioning o f the work. The Country Team discussed these issues during the 
development o f the new Country Partnership Strategy, and has agreed o n measures to ensure 
better planning, coordination, funding, and dissemination o f future analytical work. 

52. 
Technical Assistance and Policy Advice. Technical assistance and p o l i c y advice efforts 
have been demand-driven, o f high qua l i ty and timely. These included f isca l p o l i c y advice 
regarding mineral resources and financing arrangements for t h e Cahora Bassa dam. S t a f f based 
in t h e Country O f f ice also provide day-to-day advice to government counterparts, especially in 
pub l ic expenditure management, financial management, procurement, ICT , energy, HIV/AIDS, 
and agricultural and ru ra l development. 

I D A Instruments 
53. 
PRSCs. The Mozambique po r t fo l io has achieved balance between projects and budget 
support. Almost 40 percent o f new lending i s through budget support using the PRSC instrument. 
In determining the amount o f budget support, the po r t fo l io balances key parameters including: (i) 
Paris Declaration and donor harmonization targets fo r lending in the f o rm o f program support; 
(ii) Government demand for the W o r l d Bank Group to lead or engage in specific projects to 
benefit f r om the knowledge base and technical expertise o f the W o r l d Bank Group; (iii) the 
readiness o f country systems fo r further budget support; and (iv) the ab i l i ty o f the country t o 
meet agreed performance targets and triggers. G18 partners who provide direct budget support 
and Government use the Performance Assessment Framework, a p r io r i t ized subset o f indicators 
f r om t h e PARPA I1 Strategic Ma t r ix , to guide decision-making o n budget support. A l though the 
performance framework i s clear, what i s less clear and subject to negotiation among donors and 
Government i s the l e v e l o f under-performance that wou ld lead donors t o p rov ide less budget 
support. 

54. 
Common Funds and SWAPS. The Bank 's program for Mozambique has in p r inc ip le 
been supportive o f SWAPS and common funds as a means o f p rov id ing low-transaction cost 
lending to Government and fo r coordinating with other donors. T h e f i rs t SWAP supported b y 
IDA was PROAGR I fo r t h e agricultural sector. This SWAP was approved in August 1999 and 
closed December 31,2006. A l though t h i s SWAP helped achieve notable ins t i tu t iona l and p o l i c y 
changes, IDA and other key donors have decided to discontinue support f o r the second phase o f 

- 65 - 

t h e SWAP due to under-performance o f the first. IDA did not participate in any additional 
SWAP during t h e CAS period. Participation in common h d s f o r projects has neither been easy 
no r particularly successful. The main challenges have been in reconc i l ing IDA’S fiduciary 
policies and procedures with those o f Government and other donors, and weaknesses in 
government procurement and financial management systems. Fo r example, the project team 
sought to include the MAP H I V / A I D S Response Project in a mu l t i -dono r common fimd but the 
actual e f fo r t to do so took almost tw o years. Similarly, an attempt t o create a common fund fo r 
t h e p rov is ion o f financial sector assistance failed due to procurement and disbursement concerns. 
Despite these obstacles, t h e country team continues to wo rk o n a l ign ing Bank wo rk better with 
national systems. 

55 . 

APLs have facilitated longer t e r m planning fo r p rom is ing programs t o tes t approaches 
before deepening reforms or expanding- to other locations, and u l t ima te ly t o achieve greater 
impact. The Roads and Bridges APL se r ies i s an example o f a program that has used t h i s 
instrument effectively. Go ing forward, the Country Team i s incorporating t h i s lesson in to the 
new po r t fo l io by planning more APLs. 

56. 
Regional Projects: On ly one regional project, the Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment 
Acceleration Project, was approved during t h e CAS period. Regional integration opportunities 
have not been explored systematically by the country team. Interviews with selected government 
counterparts reveal that most are no t aware o f t h e IDA funds available under the IDA Regional 
Integration Pilot. The country t e am has recently begun to w o r k with the Regional Integration 
Team and other country teams to prepare four regional IDA projects, two GEF projects and one 
IDF project.31 Acco rd ing t o t e am members, notwithstanding t h e merits o f such regional projects, 
high transaction costs (stemming f rom wo rk ing in more than one country), and lack o f incentives 
within the Bank for such activities discourage task t e am leaders f r om pursuing regional projects 

VI. Aid Coordination / Dono r Harmonization 

57. 
Development a id partners and Government have collaborated to implement an impressive 
donor coordination and harmonization framework in Mozambique. Government meets with 
Program Aid Partners yearly to discuss PARPA implementation, update PAF targets, and ensure 
alignment o f development partner support with budget p r io r i t ies and reporting. Joint Sector 
Wo rk ing Groups meet regularly and frequently to review sector issues, agree o n action plans, 
and divide responsibilities. Performance and participation var ies across wo rk ing groups, 
however. The G18 donors have also committed to the Paris Declaration and have se t related 
targets for themselves. The Bank Group has been responsive in making adjustments t o meet 
many Paris Declaration indicators including: reducing the use o f project implementation un i ts , 
increasing the use o f j o i n t missions and j o i n t analytical work, and in the amount o f budget 
support provided. However, several attempts to j o i n common fund arrangements have yet to 
come to fruition. Government and development partners have asked the Bank Group t o define 
requirements fo r i t s adoption o f country systems for financial management, procurement, and 
audits, and the Bank Group i s currently responding to that request.

VII. Client Feedback 
58 . 

Interviews o f selected government officials, c i v i l society, and private sector counterparts 
were conducted during the preparation o f t h i s report (see Attachment 8). Generally, client 
impressions o f the W o r l d Bank Group a r e positive and re f lec t in large part t h e responsiveness o f 
t h e growing W o r l d Bank Group presence in t h e Mapu to o f f ice . C i v i l society, especially, has 
appreciated recent Bank Group efforts to consult them o n development matters, inc lud ing during 
the preparation o f t h e new CPS, and they stress that mo re i s needed. M a j o r points highlighted 
during these consultations include: 

The Wo r ld Bank Group i s needed for i t s financing role, technical assistance, knowledge, and 
as an interlocutor and convener o f donors. Eve ry ma jo r sector has requested that the Bank 
Group continue to be a major sponsor o f i t s operations. Acco rd ing to those interviewed, 
projects gamer greater support with t h e involvement o f t h e W o r l d Bank Group and the 
knowledge and capacity bu i ld ing generated by projects i s h igh ly valued. 
Better coordination i s needed bo th within IDA, within the W o r l d Bank Group, and be tween 
IDA and other donors, including more e f fo r t in explaining their respective roles t o 
stakeholders (clients sometimes get confused about the organization and roles o f W o r l d Bank 
Group staff). W o r l d Bank Group capacity building efforts, especially, need to be mo re 
integrated and coordinated across sectors and providers. 
Government has requested that t h e Bank Group provide strengthened and more coordinated 
support for private sector development. 
Country demand fo r regional integration i s increasing. At t h e same time, many government 
clients did no t k n ow about the IDA Regional Integration P i l o t program and funding available 
for regional integration efforts. 
T h e W o r l d Bank Group’s fiduciary processes can be burdensome, especially given capacity 
constraints. Government and other donors w o u l d l i k e the Bank t o f u l l y embrace Paris 
Declaration requirements with respect t o the use o f country systems. 

VI. Conclusions and Lessons 

59 . 

just-in-time support 

The W o r l d Bank Group’s performance in supporting CAS objectives has been 
moderately satisfactory. CAS objectives have remained v a l i d during the CAS period. The 
Country Team has provided ongoing and valued technical assistance and po l icy advice in the 
major sectors and in fiduciary areas. T h e presence o f Maputo-based sector s t a f f has been 
particularly valued by the client. The W o r l d Bank Group has also been responsive in many 
instances, p rov id ing agile, 
t o Government 
f o r unforeseen needs. 
Collaboration between IDA and I FC and MIGA, and between IDA and IMF, i s strong. An area 
o f support that did no t meet Government expectations, however, was fo r p r iva te sector 
development, wh ich cou ld have benefited from closer coordination within the W o r l d Bank 
Group. Capacity development initiatives also lacked sufficient coordination across t h e po r t fo l io , 
nor have their results been tracked. Quality-at-entry, supervision, and po r t fo l io management 
shortcomings contributed to implementation delays, closing date extensions, and restructurings 
for some long-term problem projects. Delays o f counterpart funding payments and Government 
VAT refunds t o contractors, especially, cou ld be dealt with more effectively by the Coun t ry 
Team.

Key lessons for the Bank Group include: 

Organizational 
a. Better collaboration between IDA , IFC and M IGA . Imp roved coordination and 
collaboration i s needed to answer Government’s demand fo r strengthened support in 
private sector development. Moreover, given constrained IDA resources and reflecting 
client needs, the Bank Group needs t o better adapt i t s business mode l to exp lo i t resources 
available bo th within and outside o f the Wo r ld Bank Group, inc lud ing t r u s t fbnds (e.g., 
the Carbon Fund). 

b. Improve internal coordination across sectors. The experience during t h i s CAS pe r iod 
with HIV/AIDS , private sector development, and capacity development show that there i s 
significant potential to improve cross-sector coordination. In particular, the attempt to 
mainstream HIV/AIDS solutions across sectors and projects was haphazard rather than 
strategic or systematic, and depended largely o n the interest o f the task team leader. N o r 
has collaboration to promote private sector development across and within sectors been 
systematic (including across the W o r l d Bank Group, as noted above). A l though about 
one-third o f Bank financing i s targeted for capacity development, a focused and 
integrated strategy has no t been developed. Here, the W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te and the 
A f r ica Capacity Bu i ld ing In i t ia t ive (CDMAP) can p lay an important role, inc lud ing in 
resu l ts measurement o f capacity development initiatives. Cross-sector collaboration i s 
especially important during the next CAS period as PARPA I1 emphasizes cross-cutting 
themes (HIV/AIDS, gender, ru ra l development and private sector development) that 
require cross-sector collaboration. These challenges w i l l requ i re t h e country t e am t o re - 
think h ow i t i s organized and h o w i t interfaces with Government, development partners, 
and other stakeholders. 

c. Articulate the Bank Group’s requirements regarding country systems related to 
financial management, procurement and audits, and work with Government and 
development partners t o develop a capacity development plan f o r these areas. T h i s 
step i s required in accordance with t h e Paris Declaration but i t i s also necessary to 
accommodate 
lans fo r t h e greater use o f sector wide approaches and common fund 
arrangements. 3 P 

Project Design 
d. Better appreciation o f the country% political economy, reflected in the design o f 
projects. Po l i t ica l economy factors are central to the stalled implementation fo r at least 
four projects, specifically t h e timing o f project approvals. The Bank approved po l i t ica l ly 
risky projects jus t p r io r t o elections, leaving ownership b y the subsequent administration 
less certain. Po l i t ica l realities should be taken in to account in the timing and content o f 
projects (and AAA). Fo r infrastructure projects, especially, ESW and preparation wo rk 
should include analysis o n potential winners and losers in interventions, and adjust design 

3 2 T h e Bank Group i s currently responding to this request. 

- 68 - 

and implementation arrangements as appropriate. Th is should be done throughout 
supervision as well. Implications for the composition o f infrastructure teams, in terms o f 
broader s k i l l s , should be considered. 

e. Simpler design and better project preparation to ensure a fit with Government’s 
implementation capacity. Project design remains overly-complex, especially f o r 
locally-implemented projects. Available capacity needs to be an important design 
criterion. Similarly, projects need t o make mo re intensive use o f project preparation 
facilities t o ensure implementation readiness; ha l t the creation o f parallel project 
implementation u n i t s and give more responsibilities t o l i n e m in is t r ies ; and include 
government procurement and financial management s ta f f in preparation teams. Projects 
also need to plan 
realistic implementation timeframes in order t o avo id repeated 
extension requests. Advancing pre-preparation readiness (through dialogue and 
relationship building) and pre-implementation readiness a re also key activities. 

f. M o r e strategic, yet pragmatic exploration o f project opportunities f o r regional 
integration. Many government counterparts a re unaware o f the IDA Regional Integration 
P i lo t Program, a situation that i s being addressed. On ly one regional integration project 
was implemented during t h e CAS period. T h e country t e am i s n o w making a greater 
effort t o explore regional opportunities, but w i l l need to ensure such projects have strong 
multi-country ownership. 

g. M o r e realistic CAS targets, and careful distinguishing o f PAF targets vs. CAS 
targets. Because o f the challenge o f attribution, PAF targets should on ly be selectively 
included in the CAS results framework -- where they are specific triggers in the PRSC 
series, or where the Bank Group program i s the main source o f support fo r achieving t h e 
PAF target. 

Project Supervision and Po r t fo l io Monitoring 
h. Effectively address recurrent and cross-cutting implementation issues . R Recurring 
po r t fo l io issues such as counterpart funding have been a barrier t o implementation fo r 
many projects, yet continue to pers is t . Po l i t ica l realities should be taken in to account in 
the timing, content and commitment to projects. T w o issues that are closely linked t o the 
po l i t ica l economy and t o the country’s financial management system are counterpart 
funding and VAT refunds. Lack o f counterpart funds has hampered the implementation 
progress o f several projects in the po r t fo l io during the last three years; and s low o r 
insufficient VAT refunds to contractors has resu l ted in higher costs fo r infrastructure 
projects and projects that invo lve building o f c i v i l works. T h e Bank Group w i l l consider 
these issues in fu tu re project designs, as well as he lp Government address related 
weaknesses in budget and financial management systems. Fo r the current portfolio, the 
new parameters fo r 100 percent financing have been used t o re t ro f i t existing projects 
where ownership i s no t an issue. Fo r issues related to weak ownership, a realistic view o n 
the po l i t ica l feasibility and better project design and preparation i s key. Lack o f capacity, 
especially acute at t h e sub-national level, i s another systemic p rob lem that cuts across the 
portfolio, and w i l l need t o be addressed through better project design and preparation. In 

- 69 - 

i. 

addition, a more concerted e f fo r t needs to be taken to build capacity for projects that have 
decentralized components. 
Address governance issues in all operations. Corruption in areas like service delivery 
and procurement processes (even where activities are no t using Bank Group h d s ) 
undermines the performance o f Bank Group operations and their impact o n poverty 
alleviation for the client. Lessons can be d rawn f r om projects that have effectively 
incorporated loca l accountability mechanisms in t h e i r design o f projects (as done by t h e 
Decentralized Planning and Finance and t h e ProMaputo projects, fo r example); and have 
implemented sector governance and accountability fiameworks (as done by t h e Roads 
and Bridges and Na t iona l Water Development Project I1 projects); capacity development 
in fiduciary areas w i l l also mitigate corruption risk at t h e project level. 
j. Better coordination and dissemination o f analytic work. Ana ly t ica l and advisory w o r k 
conducted during the CAS period have been relevant and o f h i g h quality. T h e i r findings 
are used t o in fo rm subsequent project design and po l icy dialogue. Improvements can be 
made, however, in the collaborative selection o f topics and t h e d e s i g n o f j o i n t w o r k 
programs, timing, and dissemination. A t ten t ion i s needed to ensure that analytical w o r k i s 
demand-driven. 
k. Improve the monitoring o f results. A l though new projects under preparation a re 
systematically paying more attention t o results management, most projects under 
implementation require actions to improve mon i to r ing and evaluation. Data co l lec t ion 
and reporting o n outcomes needs to be imp roved across the po r t fo l io . Project teams w i l l 
also need to focus on helping sectors develop M&E systems wh ich wou ld in turn he lp 
project data collection and reporting.

Appendix 8b. Summary o f Mozambique's Progress towards the MDGs as o f End-2005 

Mozambique i s l ike ly t o achieve the Poverty MDG as w e l l as the Water MDG targets. A detailed 
discussion follows: 

Mozambique is likely to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (Goal 1). The poverty headcount 

ra t io declined f r om 69 perqent o f 54.5 percent between 1996-1997 and 2002-2003. Taking i n t o 
account demographic growth over the period covered by the t w o surveys, the number o f people w h o 
were l i f ted ou t o f poverty i s estimated at 3.7 m i l l ion , G iven that on ly tw o surveys are available, and 
assuming that the current trend wou ld continue, Mozambique i s expected to h a l f t h e population 
living in absolute poverty. 

Good progress has been made towards achieving universal of primary education (Goal 2); 
nevertheless more progress is required to meet this MDG. Substantial progress has been made in 

increasing access t o primary education, particularly in lowe r primary schools (EP1, grades 1 
through 5). Government has continued to make progress with reforms that w i l l bear resu l ts in the 
near future, however, more reforms w i l l be needed t o increase enrollment and completion rates as 
well as gender disparities and quality o f primary education. 

Mozambique remains stable with respect to gender equality and empowering women (Goal 3). 

Gender indicators at a l l levels o f education have improved, particularly in EP1 and the gender 
difference in ne t enrollment ratio was reduced to on ly 4 percentage points. Never the less , significant 
gender gaps remain at the second leve l o f primary education and f i r s t leve l o f secondary education. 
M o r e progress remains to be made also in women's involvement in the productive sectors and in 
positions o f authority. 

Substantial progress has been made towards reducing child mortality and good progress has been 
made in increasing immunization rates (Goal 4). B o t h infant mo r ta l i ty and the under-five 

mo r ta l i ty rates have declined substantially from 1996 to 2002 and immun iza t ion rates have had a 
steady increase over the past years. 

Good progress has been made in improving maternal health (Goal 5). Maternal mo r ta l i ty has 

decreased and the number o f attended births has increased slightly, however Mozambique continues 
t o have some o f the lowest indicators in the region fo r these targets. 

There has been'little progress in combating HIWAIDS, malaria and other diseases (Goal 6). 

Adult prevalence rates have increased to 16.2 percent. Despite improvements in setting up the 
infrastructure needed fo r outreach and treatment, and in securing financial resources, on ly l im i t e d 
progress has been made in reducing risky behaviors. The re has been some progress in increasing t h e 
proportion o f population using effective malaria prevention. 

The MDG for urban water is expected to be met, although little progress has been made in 

ensuring environmental sustainability (Goal 7) . The share o f people with access t o safe d r ink ing 
water in urban areas has increased significantly and The MDG fo r sustainable coverage fo r urban 
water supply to reach 70 percent i s expected to be met. In environmental management, however, 
more remains t o be done as government actions are ad hoc and no t well coordinated.
