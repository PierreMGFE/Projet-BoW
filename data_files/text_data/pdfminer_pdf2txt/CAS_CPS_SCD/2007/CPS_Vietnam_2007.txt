I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. Soc ia l and Economic Context. V ie tnam ’s p o v e r t y reduc t ion and economic g r ow t h 
achievements over the last 15 years stand as a spectacular success story. Thanks t o 
ca re fu l ly imp lemen ted economic re fo rms and steady mac roeconom ic management, the 
annual r e a l GDP g r ow t h rate has averaged around 7.5 percent and the rate o f p o v e r t y has 
fa l len f r o m around 70 percent t o b e l ow 20 percent with widespread imp rovemen ts in the 
l i v e s o f Vietnamese citizens. Mo reove r , i t has been poss ib le t o m a i n t a i n this high 
economic g r ow t h rate w i th o n l y a modest increase in inequa l i ty . 

ii. T h e p e r i o d o f the last C A S (FY03-06) has been a v e r y p roduc t ive one, with a 
cons is ten t ly high ra te o f GDP g r ow t h despite a va r ie ty o f ex te rna l shocks. Pove r ty has 
con t inued t o decline, and imp lemen ta t ion o f the far-reaching Vietnamese r e f o rm p rog ram 
i s we l l underway. V i e t n am became membe r o f WTO in January 2007, and i t i s be l ieved 
that V ie tnam ’s p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l env i ronmen t w i l l ca tch up t o that o f t h e highest- 
p e r f o rm i n g IDA countries in three-to-five years. T o safeguard and sustain past 
development achievements, the acceleration o f V ie tnam ’s b a n k i n g and an t i -co r rup t ion 
reforms, whose pace have lagged other reforms, i s pa r t icu la r ly pertinent. 

iii. The Government’s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010 lays 
ou t a p a t h o f t rans i t ion towards a ma rke t economy with a socialist orientation, and sees 
V i e t n am reach ing m idd le - income coun t ry status with a GNI per capita above US$l,OOO 
by 2010. The SEDP covers 
the Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS) principles, 
inco rpo ra t ing a p o v e r t y focus and a results orientation, and i s b road ly sound. The 
p repa ra t ion process has been open and pa r t ic ipa to ry , representing a s ign i f ican t change in 
approach t o ma ins t ream p lann ing . 

i v . Vietnam’s SEDP and World Bank Group Support. T h e n ew W o r l d Bank G roup 
C o u n t r y Partnership Strategy (CPS) f o r F Y 0 7 t o F Y I 1 i s fully a l igned t o V ie tnam ’s ten th 
SEDP. The SEDP se ts ou t fou r b road objectives, w h i c h in turn are the o rgan iz ing 
p r inc ip les o f the CPS: 

(a) Im p r o v e the business environment; 
(b) Strengthen social inc lus ion ; 
(c) Strengthen na tu ra l resource and env i ronmen t management; and 
(d) Im p r o v e governance. 

v. A c omm o n theme unde r l in ing these fou r pillars i s the need t o complete rema in ing 
structural re fo rms while m o v i n g f o rw a r d a set o f amb i t ious second-generation reforms. 
Th rough these, the r o l e o f the Government w o u l d b e transformed f r o m a m a j o r p roduce r 
o f goods and services t o the regulator and p rov ide r o f foundations f o r a we l l - func t ion ing , 
equitable, and mode rn ma rke t economy. 

vi. The B a n k G roup w i l l bring t o bear a l l o f i t s instruments o f assistance t o support 
these objectives, i n c l u d i n g ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry activities, IDA p ro jec t support and a 
series o f annual Pove r ty Reduc t ion Support Credits, IFC ’s investment and techn ica l 

v i 

assistance services, MIGA activities, partnerships and O f f i c i a l Deve lopmen t Assistance 
(ODA) coo rd ina t ion . In each o f the areas, agreements have been reached with 
Gove rnmen t and other donors t o ensure that dup l ica t ion i s avoided, synergy m a x im i z e d 
and se lec t iv i ty strengthened. 

v i i . Country-led Partnership the Basis for Bank Activities in Vietnam. T h e n ew CPS 
w i l l assist Vietnam and i t s development partners achieve the H a n o i Co re Statement 
(HCS) goals o n ownership, alignment, harmonization, results and accoun tab i l i ty . Dono rs 
have p ledged t o a l i g n the i r respective ODA strategies t o the SEDP, m o n i t o r the results o f 
the i r assistance using the Government 's resu l ts m o n i t o r i n g f ramewo rk , and j o i n t l y 
conduct progress rev iews o n the rea l iza t ion o f the H C S targets. T h e Consu l ta t ive G roup 
meeting, w h i c h the B a n k co-chairs with the Government, p lays an impo r tan t r o l e in th is 
regard. 

v i i i . Results. The Government 's SEDP uses loca l ized Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals t o 
develop a system o f ind ica to rs t o m o n i t o r and evaluate progress. The n ew results-based 
CPS p rog ram m a t r i x l i n k s the SEDP higher-order goals with CPS outcomes and outputs 
supported by spec i f ic B a n k in te rven t ion , as w e l l as by other dono r partners. I t i s expected 
that annual SEDP m o n i t o r i n g repo r ts w i l l guide discussions at Consu l ta t ive G roup 
meetings, and p r o v i d e an essential input t o the CPS Progress Reports. 

ix . Support for Pillar 1: Improving the Business Environment, Support f o r this 
theme w i l l i n v o l v e a shift in focus f r o m "design" t o " imp lemen ta t ion " o f the p o l i c y

competitiveness, and m o r e e f f ic ien t and re l iab le p r o v i s i o n o f in f ras t ruc tu re services. I F C 
and MIGA w i l l con t inue the i r w o r k o n investment c l ima te r e f o rm and expand e f fo r ts t o 
catalyze the p r iva te sector response t o imp rovemen ts in the business environment. M o s t 
IDA credits w i l l support po l icy , ins t i tu t iona l and in f ras t ruc tu re support f o r Vietnam's 
ongo ing transition, with annual PRSCs p l a y i n g an especially impo r tan t ro le . 

x . Support for Pillar 2: Strengthening Soc ia l Inclusion. P r io r i t ies f o r Bank G roup 
support are: (a) better understanding o f pove r ty and p i l o t i n g new instruments t o reach the 
poor; (b) ma ins t ream ing gender issues across the p o r t f o l i o and i n c l u d i n g peop le with 
d isab i l i t ies in the development process; (c) 
increasing access t o qua l i ty , basic

period, Vietnam’s GNI per cap i ta i s p ro jec ted t o m o v e s tead i ly towa rds the IDA 
graduation threshold. T h e Vietnamese government has expressed i t s desire t o seek an 
oppo r tun i ty f o r b l e n d i n g IDA and IBRD resources. In this regard, the W o r l d B a n k has 
scheduled a creditworthiness r e v i ew in FY 0 8 . T h e I F C and MIGA p rog rams are also 
expected t o g r ow in the c om i n g years. The IFC inves tmen t p r o g r am i s expected t o reach

V ie tnam ’s p o v e r t y reduc t ion and economic g r ow t h achievements ove r the last 15

The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) was 
the foundation of the last Vietnam Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). I t was an 
impo r tan t m i les tone in t h e mode rn iza t ion o f planning processes in Vietnam, focused o n

some cases m o r e amb i t ious Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs). 

5 . 

Vietnam’s ove ra l l development achievements during the CPRGS period have 
been remarkable. F r o m 2001-05 annual rea l GD P g r ow t h averaged 7.6 percent. T h i s 
g r ow t h was driven by r a p i d expo r t g r ow t h and p r iva te sector development and was 
supported by strategies with strong na t iona l owne rsh ip and by sound mac roeconom ic 
po l ic ies . This annual g r ow t h rate corresponds t o 6.1 percent increase o f per capita GDP. 
The comb ina t ion o f r a p i d rea l g r ow t h and a gradual appreciation o f the rea l exchange rate 
resu l ted in an imp ress ive increase o f GN I p e r capita measured in do l la r t e rm s : f r o m 
US$415 in 2001 t o an estimated US$620 in 2005. V i e t n am has p r o v e d i t s e l f t o b e a 
res i l ien t economy, as this strong pe r fo rmance was accomplished despite ex te rna l shocks, 
such as severe acute resp i ra to ry syndrome ( S A R S ) , av ian in f luenza , rising o i l prices, and 
na tu ra l calamities. 

6. 
Increased competition in product markets was a key driver of reform. Since 
2001, tariff reductions under the A S E A N F ree Trade A rea (AFTA) and the V ie tnam -US 
B i la te ra l Trade Ag reemen t have fo rced adjustments in the state sector. In teg ra t ion with 
the w o r l d economy was strengthened s ign i f ican t ly , with exports accoun t ing f o r 7 1 
percent o f GDP in 2005, up f r o m 56 percent in 2001, and p r iva te business emp loymen t 
inc reas ing f i v e - f o l d be tween 2001 and 2005. Accession t o the W o r l d Trade O rgan iza t ion 
(WTO) was agreed by the WTO General C o u n c i l in Novembe r 2006, and V i e t n am 
became WTO ’ s 150th membe r in January 2007. Because o f i t s w ide - rang ing imp l ica t ions 
beh ind the border, especially in re la t ion t o the lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk , WTO 
accession i s seen as a mechan ism t o l o c k in k e y economic re fo rms f o r subsequent years. 

7. GDP growth was led by a dynamic manufacturing sector, w h i c h recorded an 
average annual r e a l g r ow t h o f 11 percent f r o m 2001-05. W h i l e the mos t r a p i d l y 
expanding products, such as garments and footwear, have bene f i ted f r o m s t rong exports, 
domestic sales also have been robust. The ag r icu l tu re and fisheries sectors overcame 
adverse weather and wide f luc tua t ions in c omm o d i t y p r ices t o g r ow by m o r e than 3.5 
percent per year o n average during 2001-05. Services have p i c k e d up in the last 2 years 
t o reco rd an average annual increase o f 7.2 percent ove r 2001-05. Tou r ism - re la ted 
services have also been especially buoyan t . Investment, as reco rded in the na t iona l 
accounts, increased f r o m 3 1 percent o f GDP in 2001 t o 36 percent in 2005. The share o f 
the domestic p r iva te sector in t o t a l inves tmen t rose f r om 23 percent in 2001 t o over 3 2 
percent in 2005. In contrast, the share o f the state-owned sector in t o t a l investment 
dec l ined f r om app rox ima te ly 60 percent in 2001 t o 52 percent in 2005. 

8. 
From a slow start in 2001, export growth accelerated to average 2 1 percent 
per year during 2001-05. In the same period, impo r ts g rew by 23 percent pe r year. T h e 
trade balance d e f i c i t widened f r o m 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2002 t o 5.2 percent in 2004, 
re f lec t ing the im p o r t needs o f a r a p i d l y expand ing economy, but na r rowed t o 1.6 percent 
in 2005. Strong rem i t tance f l ow s we re also recorded in th is pe r iod . Transfers th rough 
f o rm a l channels rose f r o m a l i t t l e ove r U S $ 1 b i l l i o n in 2001 t o nea r ly U S $ 3 b i l l i o n in 
2005. A s a resu l t , V ie tnam ’s current account registered a surplus o f app rox ima te ly 0.4 
percent o f GDP in 2005, compared t o a d e f i c i t o f 1.9 percent in 2002. Past current 

2 

account de f ic i ts we re f inanced m a i n l y by f o r e i g n d i rec t inves tmen t (FDI) i n f l ow s and 
concessional lending. V ie tnam ’s external debt s tood at a manageable 33 percent o f GDP 
in 2005, w i th debt service at app rox ima te ly 5 percent o f exports. Ex te rna l reserves rose t o 
US$8 .6 b i l l i o n (app rox ima te ly 11 weeks w o r t h o f im p o r t s o f goods and services), 
compared with US$3 .4 b i l l i o n at the end o f 2001. 

9 . 
The economic transition during the last CAS period was accompanied by an 
institutional overhaul. With the imp lemen ta t ion o f a new State Budget L a w in 2004, 
P u b l i c F inanc ia l Managemen t (PFM) has made s ign i f ican t achievements in i n f o rm a t i o n 
disclosure and p u b l i c pa r t ic ipa t ion in decision-making. T h e entire 2005 budget was 
disclosed t o the p u b l i c f o r the f i rs t t ime . The N a t i o n a l Assemb ly i s n o w responsible f o r 
the app rova l o f budget, i n c l u d i n g a l loca t ions t o 
l ow e r 
leve ls o f government. 
Decen t ra l iza t ion i s another impo r tan t t ra i t o f the ongo ing ins t i tu t iona l transition. By 
now , a lmos t h a l f o f budge t expenditures are dec ided by authorities at sub-national levels. 
T h e n ew Grassroots Democ racy decree mandates considerable disclosure and 
consu l ta t ion in re la t ion t o commune - leve l budgets. The planning process, as evidenced 
by the d r a f t i n g process o f SEDP , has also become cons ide rab ly pa r t ic ipa to ry . 

10. There has been some progress o n the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion r e f o rm agenda as we l l . 
Service d e l i v e r y u n i t s have been separated f r o m the adm in is t ra t ive organization, and 
clear progress has been made in streamlining government procedures with the adop t ion o f 
the One-Stop Shop mode l . Service delivery u n i t s are inc reas ing ly h e l d accountable f o r 
the i r services, as they a l l are n o w mandated t o have use r feedback under the new Decree 
43. Im p r o v e d lega l and regu la to ry p o l i c y f ramewo rks f o r e lec t r ic i ty , water, and forestry, 
as w e l l as f o r inves tmen t and enterprises, have been established. L o o k i n g forward, 
V ie tnam ’s a b i l i t y t o p l a n and implement inves tmen t p ro jec ts s t i l l needs t o be 
strengthened t o fu r the r reduce f inanc ia l r i s k s and po ten t ia l con t ingen t l iab i l i t ies . 

11. The fight against corruption also has gained momentum with a new systemic, 
preventive approach to replace past ad-hoc punitive practices. This n ew approach 
reduces the scope f o r co r rup t ion by simplifying adm in is t ra t ive procedures and making 
p u b l i c 
transactions m o r e transparent. 
I t re l ies o n new legislation, strengthened 
government systems, and increased transparency. A h i g h - l e v e l an t iconup t ion comm i t tee 
with considerable powers, set up under the au tho r i ty o f the P r ime Minister, and 
Vietnam’s f i rs t an t ico r rup t ion l a w are central elements o f the n ew strategy. 

12. Although Vietnam’s development i s rightly regarded as a success story, there 
a re certain fault lines that could put Vietnam’s future progress at risk. The r e f o rm o f 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state-owned comme rc ia l banks (SOCBs) has lagged 
b e h i n d other re fo rms . L i m i t e d p r o f i t incentives in the SOCBs, and the i r close ties with 
l o c a l governments and SOEs, have led t o a p o o r q u a l i t y o f the i r lend ing p o r t f o l i o . 
F igu res o n the share o f non -pe r fo rm ing loans ( N P L s ) vary depending o n the d e f i n i t i o n 
used. But a p r o v i s i o n i n g o n the order o f 8 t o 10 percent o f outstanding c red i t m a y b e 
needed t o o f fse t poss ib le losses. The numbe r o f SOEs 
and their share o f the economy 
have dec l ined steadily, but n o t as r a p i d l y as planned. 
In the medium term, increased 
fo re ign compe t i t ion coup led with the enforcement o f 
h a r d budget constraints f o r the 

3 

SOEs i s expected t o lead t o a m o r e r a p i d pace o f re fo rm . Add i t iona l ly , with WTO 
accession, the government i s t a k i n g a m o r e dec is ive approach t o banking re fo rm . Based 
o n the recen t ly adopted r o a d map f o r accelerated banking re fo rm , the government sets ou t 
t o equ i t ize a l l five SOCBs and t rans fo rm the State B a n k o f V ie tnam 's (SBV ) mandate t o 
focus o n b a n k i n g supe rv is ion and the conduct o f mone ta ry p o l i c y . 

13. A joint Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) placed Vietnam at a 
low risk of external debt distress from 2006 to 2011. V ie tnam 's external debt ra t ios 
w i l l r em a i n b e l ow applicable po l icy -based debt thresholds unde r the baseline and under 
standard stress scenarios p r o v i d e d that ex te rna l b o r r ow i n g po l ic ies con t inue t o b e gu ided 
by the prudence that has characterized V ie tnam 's po l ic ies ove r the last f ew years. 
Howeve r , the expansionary po l ic ies contained in the SEDP c o u l d endanger this re la t ive ly

14. Vietnam's ove ra l l Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating

poverty reduction. New [ 
househo ld data ind ica te that

16. Poverty reduction has been driven primarily by rapid economic growth. 
Sustained and r a p i d reduc t ion in pove r ty demonstrates that V ie tnam 's high economic 
g r ow t h rate o f the past years continues t o translate i n t o better living standards f o r i t s poo r . 
O the r factors have also been impo r tan t in exp la in ing the recent imp rovemen ts in welfare: 

0 Massive government transfers to poorer parts o f the country have p r o v e n 
e f fec t ive in reduc ing pove r ty . R u r a l in f ras t ruc tu re development has increased 
access t o schools, hea l th c l in ics , and markets. 

0 Rapid creation of private sector jobs and wage employment. T h e reduc t ion in 
pove r ty coincides with a massive sh i f t in emp loymen t f r o m ag r icu l tu re t o the 
wage sector. The p r o p o r t i o n o f the wo rk ing -age popu la t ion w h o are farmers 
dec l ined f r o m app rox ima te ly 50 percent in 1998 t o less than 4 0 percent in 2004. 
Wage emp loymen t rose f r o m 1 1 percent o f the wo rk ing -age p o p u l a t i o n in 1998 t o 
16.5 percent in 2002 and t o 18 percent in 2004. 

0 A r i s e in the world market prices o f agricultural export commodities, such as 
coffee and rice, has boos ted incomes f o r m a n y o f those w h o r em a i n in agriculture. 

17. Poverty reduction continues to be widespread across the country, but poverty 
remains overwhelmingly rural. In the past s ix years, r u r a l p o v e r t y has decreased by 
3.4 percentage points pe r year, w h i c h i s faster than f o r the coun t ry as a who le (3.0 
percentage po in ts pe r year). Tha t said, pove r ty in Vietnam remains o v e rw h e lm i n g l y ru ra l , 
with r u r a l pove r ty at 25 percent compared t o 4 percent f o r u rban areas. 

5 

18. W h i l e a l l e ight regions have made progress, the pove r ty r a t e rema ins much 
h ighe r in some. The N o r t h West stands ou t as being p a r t i c u l a r l y poor, with 59 percent o f 
i t s popu la t ion living in pove r ty . Only 3 percent o f the t o t a l p o p u l a t i o n l ives in the N o r t h 
West, yet the r e g i o n i s h om e t o 9 percent o f the poo r . T h e Cen t ra l H igh lands and the 
N o r t h Cen t ra l Coast have made reasonable progress during the past 11 years and have 
m o r e than ha lved the numbers in pove r ty since 1993. Howeve r , b o t h reg ions reco rd 
app rox ima te ly one - th i rd o f the i r popu la t ions as living in pove r ty . 

19. T h e gender gap also has been n a r row ed in a numbe r o f respects. There i s n o w 
l i t t l e d i f fe rence be tween the ne t enrolment rates f o r girls and b o y s th roughou t the school 
system p r i o r t o te r t ia ry education, and w om e n pa r t ic ipa te o n l y s l i g h t l y less ac t ive ly in the 
labo r force than d o men . Da ta o n earnings also suggest tha t the gender gap i s closing. 
V i e t n am has the h ighes t percentage o f w om e n in a N a t i o n a l Pa r l iamen t in the As ia - 
Pac i f ic r e g i o n (27 percent since 2002). In all, V i e t n am i s one o f the countries in East A s i a 
that has seen the m o s t r a p i d change in c los ing the gender gap in the last 2 0 years. I t has 
im p r o v e d i t s rank o n the Gender Deve lopmen t I n d e x f r o m 89 (out o f 136 countries) in 
2001 t o 80 in 2004. 

20. S t rong progress has also been achieved on most o the r social MDGs. V ie tnam i s 
expected t o a t ta in a numbe r o f other V ie tnam Deve lopmen t Goa ls (VDGs ) (Annex 3). 
Targets f o r p r im a r y schoo l attendance, un ive rsa l education, and im p r o v e d education 
q u a l i t y have already been achieved. G o o d progress has also been made in reduc ing c h i l d 
m o r t a l i t y and ma lnu t r i t ion . There has also been success in c o n t r o l l i n g vaccine- 
preventable illnesses, a long with progress in d iagnos ing and c u r i n g a high p ropo r t ion o f 
n ew TB cases, and in c o n t r o l l i n g m i c r o nutrient de f ic iency diseases, such as goiter. The 
rate o f n ew HIV/AIDS infections, w h i c h rose d rama t ica l ly be tween 1998 and 2002, 
recen t ly has begun t o decline. Howeve r , there s t i l l remains a need f o r determined and 
c a r e h l l y considered p o l i c y responses t o meet the targets set f o r HIV/AIDS. 

21. Despite the s t rong gains in the hea l th MDGs, and budge t increases ra is ing the 
sector share beyond 5 percent, variations in hea l th ind ica to rs by r e g i o n and province, and 
by e thn ic i ty and income, p o i n t t o con t inu ing differences in the levels and qua l i ty o f 
hea l th care received. In addition, some longstanding disease threats, such as TB, malaria, 
and dengue fever, r em a i n serious threats in many regions, w h i l e the last f i v e years have 
shown the country’s suscep t ib i l i ty t o emerging in fec t ious illnesses. In particular, V ie tnam 
p roved highly vu lne rab le t o H IV w h i c h l i n k e d up with a resurgent f o rm o f TB, S A R S , 
and A v i a n In f luenza . The 2000-2005 SEDP did n o t anticipate this need t o scale up 
disease con t ro l activities, n o r the associated demands made o n sector resources and o n 
the a t ten t ion o f hea l th p o l i c y makers. 

22. 
Vietnam’s 
imp ress ive achievements in reduc ing p o v e r t y nonetheless exist 
alongside slower progress fo r a n impo r t an t g roup o f the popu lat ion: ethnic 
m ino r i t ies . Pove r ty f o r b o t h the Kinh and ethnic m i n o r i t y popu la t ions has fa l len steadily 
f r om 1993 t o 2004. Howeve r , progress has been m o r e r a p i d f o r the Kinh and Chinese 
populations. In 2004, 14 percent o f the Kinh and Chinese peop le were living in poverty, 
compared t o 6 1 percent o f ethnic m ino r i t ies (figure 2.4). A l t h o u g h ethnic m ino r i t ies 

6 

account f o r o n l y 13 percent o f the to ta l popu la t ion , they constitute 39 percent o f the poo r . 
Their p o v e r t y i s also deeper than the p o v e r t y o f o the r groups.

23. Rapid migration generates new vulnerabilities. The Vietnamese popu la t ion has 

become inc reas ing ly mob i le , b o t h p h y s i c a l l y and occupationally. I t i s estimated that the 
u rban popu la t ion i s g r ow i n g at 1 m i l l i o n peop le a year. A recent census f o r H o C h i Minh 
C i t y showed that nea r ly one - th i rd o f the p o p u l a t i o n i s recent migrants. Y e t a system o f 
househo ld reg is t ra t ion p resen ts s ign i f ican t adm in is t ra t ive barriers f o r those choosing t o 
m ig ra te in search o f better l ive l ihoods . Urban p o v e r t y i s l i k e l y t o b e underrepresented in 
mos t p o v e r t y data because migrants o f t e n are absent f r o m sample surveys. M o r e 
impo r tan t ly , since m ig ran ts are also absent f r o m some o f the data used t o plan and budge t

111. VIETNAM’S VISION FOR 2010 

25. The Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-10 envisages Vietnam 
reaching middle-income country status by 2010, with a GNI per capita above 
US$l,OOO. T h e p l a n emphasizes the ove ra l l ob jec t ive o f ach iev ing sustainable 
development based o n fou r pillars: (a) im p r o v e the business environment, (b) strengthen 
soc ia l inclusion, (c) strengthen na tu ra l resource and env i ronmen t management, and (d) 
im p r o v e governance. A c omm o n theme unde r l in ing these p i l l a r s i s the need t o complete 
rema in ing s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms w h i l e advanc ing a se t o f amb i t ious second-generation 
re fo rms t o establish the ins t i tu t ions f o r a m o d em ma rke t economy. Th rough these 
reforms, the r o l e o f government w o u l d b e t rans fo rmed f r o m p roduce r o f goods and 
services t o p rov ide r and regu la to r o f foundations f o r a we l l - func t ion ing , equitable, and 
m o d em ma rke t economy. 

A. IMPROV ING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

26. Business development i s the key to building a prosperous and inclusive society. 
The new SEDP acknowledges the impo r tance o f p r iva te businesses as the engine f o r 
economic g r ow t h and j o b creation. The plan c lea r ly defines the r o l e o f the state t o create 
an enab l ing env i ronmen t f o r business focused o n building ins t i tu t ions and imp lemen t ing 
appropriate economic and soc ia l po l ic ies . T h e p l a n spec i f ica l ly refers t o fos te r ing p r iva te 
business pa r t ic ipa t ion in a l l economic sectors, especially in key i n d u s t r i a l sectors. 
A c c o r d i n g t o the SEDP, the state shou ld support p r o d u c t i o n o n l y in sectors in w h i c h 
other economic actors do n o t want, o r a re unable, t o invest. 

27 . Sustaining business development in Vietnam requires completion of the 
structural reform agenda. The k e y p r io r i t ies in this respect are fully deve lop ing land 
markets, res t ruc tu r ing the f inanc ia l sector, manag ing state assets in a m o r e e f f ic ien t and 
transparent manner, m o b i l i z i n g resources t o meet the considerable 
in f ras t ruc tu re 
development needs, and imp lemen t ing re fo rms t o imp rove the e f f ic iency and timeliness 
o f in f ras t ruc tu re inves tmen t and services. B o t h g loba l in teg ra t ion and domestic re fo rms 
are needed t o sustain r a p i d economic g r ow t h while avo id ing the accumu la t ion o f la rge 
contingent l i a b i l i t i e s by the government. Further in teg ra t ion with the w o r l d economy, 
especially th rough V ie tnam ’s accession t o the W o r l d Trade O rgan iza t ion (WTO), 
i s 
b o u n d t o l o c k in some o f the requ i red changes and l e v e l the p l a y i n g f i e l d be tween 
domestic and fo re ign enterprises. A lso , WTO comm i tmen ts generates s t rong incen t ives 
t o accelerate re fo rms in the banking sector. Concurrently, a comp lemen ta ry r e f o rm 
agenda i s a im i n g t o l e v e l the p l a y i n g field be tween the domestic p r iva te sector and SOEs 
t o e f f i c i e n t l y m o b i l i z e and u t i l i z e capital, b o t h p u b l i c and p r iva te . L o o k i n g ahead, the 
coun t ry faces a set o f challenges in this area. V ie tnam s t i l l lacks a range o f finance and 
business related laws, such as a t r u s t law, secu r i t iza t ion law , de r iva t ive law , and a p r iva te 
pens ion law, a l l o f w h i c h w i l l b e ins t rumen ta l in deve lop ing cap i ta l markets.

B. STRENGTHENING 

SOCIAL INCLUSION 

28 . T o ensure that growth continues to be equitable and pro-poor, renewed 
emphasis i s required to reach out to marginalized groups. The n e x t five-year cyc le 
o f fe rs the prospect f o r V i e t n am t o complete i t s t rans i t ion across several dimensions: 
increased re l iance o n ma rke t mechanisms, full membe rsh ip in the g loba l economy, and 
m idd le - income coun t ry status. However, success in these multiple transitions w i l l also 
requ i re that business development benefits the p o p u l a t i o n at large, as i t has so far. T h e 
labo r market, r u r a l development, and the soc ia l sectors are fundamen ta l in this respect. 

29 . A s the economy restructures and V i e t n am becomes a g loba l player, e f fec t ive safety 
nets and budge t a l loca t ion no rms can help households and reg ions cope with adverse 
shocks, whe the r f r o m na tu ra l calamities, economic shocks, o r inc reas ing economic 
disparities. As p o v e r t y continues t o have a s t rong spatial d imens ion in Vietnam, i t w i l l b e 
impo r tan t t o con t inue p rev ious success in inc reas ing access t o basic in f ras t ruc tu re 
services f o r the r u r a l poo r . Renewed e f fo r ts a re also needed t o ensure that development 
does n o t ma rg ina l ize ethnic m ino r i t ies . F ina l ly , pockets o f deep p o v e r t y within c i t ies are 
o f g r ow i n g significance, pa r t icu la r ly those associated with migrants, who have limited 
access t o basic soc ia l services. Urban p o v e r t y i s l i k e l y t o increase in com ing years. 
Because o f the r a p i d pace o f m i g r a t i o n and urban growth, addressing eme rg ing urban 
p o v e r t y issues w i l l requ i re imp rovemen ts in l o c a l planning and f inanc ing to ensure that 
in f ras t ruc tu re ne two rks and soc ia l services are p r o v i d e d “in time” in the right places. 

30. Looking forward, as part of the second generation of economic reforms, social 
services need to be upgraded. Under cen t ra l p lann ing , V i e t n am managed t o build 
inc lus ive basic hea l th and education systems that reach the vast m a j o r i t y o f the 
popu la t ion and de l ive r social ind ica to rs comparable t o those o f m idd le - income countries. 
Howeve r , these systems have n o t coped w e l l with the t rans i t ion t o a market economy, 
and they are i l l - s u i t e d t o address the m o r e comp lex and expensive needs o f an 
inc reas ing ly prosperous popu la t ion . The challenge n o w i s t o comb ine the e f f ic iency o f 
ma rke t mechanisms with the b road coverage that characterized educa t ion and hea l th 
services unde r cen t ra l planning. Success in th is comb ina t ion c o u l d l a y the foundations f o r 
un ive rsa l systems. T h e ob jec t ive o f the government shou ld b e t o m o v e f r o m supply- t o 
demand-side financing, t o foster compe t i t ion among p rov ide rs and increase e f f ic iency . 
Howeve r , the d e l i v e r y and q u a l i t y o f basic services has been neglected in favo r o f fo r - fee 
services, and the p o o r have suffered. The recent i n i t i a t i v e o f the government t o strengthen 
the accoun tab i l i ty o f service de l ive ry units while i n t r o d u c i n g po ten t ia l ly mo re e f fec t ive 
moda l i t ies t o support the p o o r i s encouraging in this regard. At the same time, i t w i l l be 
impo r tan t t o tack le c r i t i c a l p u b l i c hea l th func t ions i n c l u d i n g respond ing t o AI, S A R S , and 
other p u b l i c hea l th r isks w h i c h by d e f i n i t i o n pe r ta in to the en t i re popu la t ion , and 
reo r ien t ing some government resources t o k e y p u b l i c hea l th functions, such as A I con t ro l 
and prevention. 

3 1. The links between social inclusion and business development a re stronger than 
they may seem at first. P u b l i c funding shou ld n o t b e confused with p u b l i c p rov is ion . 
Over time, businesses c o u l d become impo r tan t suppliers o f social services. Te r t ia ry 
education, hea l th care services, and, maybe in a not-so-distant future, pens ion programs, 

9 

a l l c o u l d b e supp l ied by non-state organizations, 
i n c l u d i n g p r iva te enterprises, 
cooperatives and nongove rnmen ta l organizations (NGOs). Meanwh i le , i f p rope r ly 
reformed, soc ia l insurance c o u l d accumulate a massive amount o f resources be fo re the 
ac t ive wo rke rs o f today start retiring. These resources w i l l need t o b e invested. I f 
managed in a sound and transparent manner, they c o u l d make a m a j o r con t r ibu t ion t o 
cap i ta l accumulation. M o s t obv ious ly , good h um a n resources cannot b e dissociated f r o m 
a hea l thy and capable popu la t ion . In particular, the development o f the education system 
i s the k e y t o tap a l l the talent available and t o build up the s k i l l s that the business 
c omm u n i t y needs. Las t but n o t least, inc lus ive development i s at the r o o t o f social 
s tab i l i ty . I n c l u s i v e development has been one o f V ie tnam ’s m a i n advantages over other 
coun t r ies at the same l e v e l o f development. 
c. STRENGTHENING NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 

32. The new SEDP sets out directions to address unsustainable and inequitable 
patterns of natural resources use, access, and control. Es tab l ish ing the f ramewo rk f o r 
an e f f ic ien t land market i s an impo r tan t part o f the second-generation r e f o rm p rog ram . 
L a n d titling i s b o u n d t o increase e f f ic iency . L a n d U s e - r i g h t Certificates (LUCs ) can b e

w h i c h i s a rguab ly the m a i n constraint t o business development in V ie tnam . P rope r ty t i t les 
shou ld also p r o v i d e a m o r e sound founda t ion t o develop a rea l estate market. F r o m a 
soc ia l perspective, they c o u l d help fo rma l ize the status o f u rban migrants, w h o con t inue 
t o be registered as “temporary residents” despite h a v i n g l i v e d in the c i t ies f o r years, i f n o t 
decades. Howeve r , l a n d t i t l ing alone i s n o t enough t o ensure e f f ic iency and equ i ty . 
Strengthening l a n d management and adm in is t ra t ion i s a top p r i o r i t y t o consolidate and 
safeguard user-rights already issued, t o p romo te e f f ic iency and equity th rough enhanced 
transparency in l a n d records management as well as t o strengthen the eme rg ing r u r a l and 
pe r i -u rban l a n d markets. 

33. W h i l e V ie tnam ’s l o n g dec l ine in forest cove r i s being reversed, a m a j o r p o r t i o n o f 
the rema in ing forest l a n d i s degraded, and n ew plantings tend t o have l ow e r species 
diversity. Im p r o v e d forest resource management w o u l d bene f i t an estimated 25 m i l l i o n 
r u r a l inhabitants, many o f w h o m are ethnic m ino r i t ies , w h o rely o n forests f o r subsistence 
and income as w e l l as f o r env i ronmen ta l services. Water i s becom ing inc reas ing ly scarce, 
with compe t ing demands f r o m r a p i d indus t r ia l and urban g r ow t h as w e l l as ag r icu l tu ra l 
uses . To im p r o v e water resources management, m o v e t ow a r d in teg ra ted river bas in 
management, and use water resources m o r e e f fec t ive ly , better cooperation across sectors 
and ins t i tu t iona l boundaries i s essential. 

34. Environmental externalities from rapid industrialization, urbanization and 
agricultural growth may lead to increased pollution and environmental degradation. 
T o p reven t these f r o m happening, 
im p r o v e d env i ronmen ta l po l ic ies and a m o r e 
systematic u s e o f enforceable env i ronmen ta l standards are ca l led fo r . The standards need 
to focus o n reduc ing env i ronmen ta l degradation th rough better waste management and 
reduced a i r and water p o l l u t i o n within each sector. In recent years, V ie tnam ’s progress in 
ach iev ing i t s amb i t ious env i ronmen ta l objectives has been strong o n the p o l i c y front, 
i n c l u d i n g manda t ing env i ronmen ta l 
impac t 
assessments 
(E IAs ) . Howeve r , 

10 

imp lemen ta t ion rema ins an issue. W h i l e the coun t ry has made progress o n a l l o f the 
environment-related VDGs and targets, i n c l u d i n g wastewater treatment, so l id waste 
collection, and increased forest coverage, attainment o f the amb i t ious objectives w i l l 
requ i re add i t iona l e f fo r ts . Weaknesses rema in in the use o f p r o j ec t - leve l env i ronmen ta l 
rev iews and m i t i g a t i o n measures, during b o t h p ro jec t p repa ra t ion and imp lemen ta t ion . 
Furthermore, the in teg ra t ion o f env i ronmen ta l concerns in planning at p rog ramma t ic 
leve ls remains a challenge, especially in p u b l i c inves tmen t planning and in reg iona l 
p l a n n i n g f o r l a n d and resource use. In addition, many regu la t ions f o r env i ronmen ta l 
p ro tec t ion are n o t fully operational, as p r o v i n c i a l and l o c a l governments 
lack 
adm in is t ra t ive capac i ty and human and f inanc ia l resources. 

D. IMPROV ING GOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION 

35. Relationship between the state and soc iety i s taking new forms. 
The 
Commun is t Party continues t o b e the dom inan t p o l i t i c a l force. T h e three-person 
co l lec t ive leadership cons is t ing o f the Commun is t Pa r ty General Secretary, the P r im e 
M in is te r , and the President, was recon f i rmed by the ou tcome o f the l o t h Pa r ty Congress 
in the spring o f 2006. But the leadership i s ac t ive ly emb rac ing the concepts o f 
transparency, accountability, and good governance. Juxtaposed t o the highly centralized 
structure at the center, a decentralized p o l i c y -m a k i n g process - characterized by 
consensus-building and devo lu t ion o f powe rs t o p rov inces and fu r the r d o w n to d is t r ic ts - 
i s evo lv ing . This is, in part, in response t o the need f o r decentralized dec is ion -mak ing in 
a ma rke t economy. Increasingly, a v igo rous p u b l i c debate i s occu r r ing o n issues o f 
economic and soc ia l p o l i c y . The N a t i o n a l Assembly has assumed m u c h stronger 
oversight and leg is la t ive roles. A case in p o i n t i s the cons t i tu t iona l in t roduc t ion o f a 
mechan ism f o r a vo te o f n o confidence, w h i c h was used f o r the f i rs t t im e in 2004, when 
the M i n i s t e r o f Ag r icu l tu re and R u r a l Deve lopmen t was h e l d t o account f o r a m a j o r 
co r rup t ion scandal. Mo reove r , th rough the na t iona l ly televised Q&A sessions o f the 
N a t i o n a l Assembly, m in is te rs have had t o assume respons ib i l i ty f o r l a c k o f performance 
in their sectors and func t iona l areas. Furthermore, g r ow i n g pa r t ic ipa t ion o f citizens in 
p lann ing and imp lemen ta t ion b o t h at the na t iona l and l o c a l levels, i n c l u d i n g ethnic 
m ino r i t ies , has systematically occurred during the SEDP preparation. Increasing the 
independence f o r the State Bank o f V i e t n am as a m o d em Cen t ra l Bank as we l l as the 
establishment o f the new State Audit o f Vietnam i s b e i n g ac t ive ly considered. And 
f ina l ly , the m e d i a i s being g i v e n m o r e leeway in addressing issues o f malfeasance and 
co r rup t ion . The i r k e y r o l e in th is fight i s n o w w i d e l y recognized. 

36. For Vietnam to achieve middle-income status by 2010, it i s imperative that the 
foundations of a modern market economy be established. K e y challenges inc lude 
comp le t ing the r e f o rm o f p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, r e f o rm i n g tax administration, 
setting up mechanisms t o manage p u b l i c debt at a l l levels, and inc reas ing transparency in 
p u b l i c procurement. There i s also a pressing need t o fully imp lemen t the Grassroots 
Democ racy decree and fight corruption, especially at a t im e in w h i c h r a p i d economic 
g r ow t h w i l l increase oppo r tun i t ies f o r g ra f t faster than government systems imp rove . In 
addition, the lega l and j u d i c i a r y r e f o rm agenda, w h i c h i s m u c h in f luenced by the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the V ie tnam -US B i la te ra l Trade Agreement and the accession t o the 
WTO, needs t o be pursued v igo rous ly . A s the economy develops and domestic f i r m s 

11 

grow, 
t rad i t iona l 
transactions based o n t r u s t and r e l a t i v e l y simple enforcement 
mechanisms w i l l become inc reas ing ly i l l - s u i t e d t o the needs o f businesses. 

37. 
I n a country as decentralized as Vietnam, some o f the most important changes 
w i l l have to take place at the loca l level. 
Increased de lega t ion o f dec is ion -mak ing 
p ow e r t o l o c a l authorities has created vast gaps in the q u a l i t y o f business-enabling 
environments across V ie tnam , while innova t ive and entrepreneurial l o c a l governments 
advance reforms and streamline bureaucratic processes t o p romo te businesses. 
Con t iguous provinces, with similar endowments but d i f fe ren t comm i tmen t o f the l o c a l 
authorities t o econom ic re fo rm , o f ten a re w o r l d s apart in te rms o f enterprise registration, 
inves tmen t by f o r e i g n companies, and the a v a i l a b i l i t y o f wage employment. R igo rous ly 
measu r ing the q u a l i t y o f governance (either l o c a l l y o r at the na t iona l leve l ) i s n o t easy. 
Howeve r , benchma rk ing p rov inces o n key aspects p o t e n t i a l l y a f fec t ing business a c t i v i t y 
i s a step in the right d i rec t ion . The mode rn iza t ion o f p r o v i n c i a l planning processes, a long 
the l ines observed at the na t iona l level-relying 
o n consu l ta t ion with the l o c a l business 
c omm u n i t y and broader c i v i l society-should 
encourage add i t iona l improvements. 
Comb ined with appropriate budge t allocations f o r the p rov inces with greater needs, the 
p r om o t i o n o f l o c a l leaders w h o succeed in fos te r ing g r ow t h and reduc ing pove r ty w o u l d 
p r o v i d e a p ow e r f u l incen t ive f o r change. 

5 

38 . Corruption remains an important issue, perhaps a more complex one than 
may be apparent. R a p i d g r ow t h creates enormous oppo r tun i t ies f o r corruption, at a time 
when the ins t i tu t ions o f a mode rn ma rke t economy are s t i l l b e i n g established. Pe t ty 
co r rup t ion i s rampant, but adm in is t ra t ive re fo rms have b rough t some improvements, as 
evidenced in repo r t ca rd surveys o f several p u b l i c services. There i s also co r rup t ion in 
l a n d administration, SOEs, de l ive ry o f social services, and management o f p u b l i c 
inves tmen t projects. Howeve r , the extent and moda l i t ies are n o t a lways clear, and a 
cu l tu re o f "sharing the boun ty " further blurs the p ic tu re . On the other hand, there seems 
t o be l i t t l e state capture. P o l i c y re fo rms have n o t favo red any obv ious i n t e r e s t group; they 
c lea r ly weaken the mos t p ow e r f u l p u b l i c sector conglomerates. 

39 . A clear commitment by the government to tackle corruption i s encouraging, 
but firm implementation o f the new strategy w i l l be crucial. The government, 
recogn iz ing that co r rup t ion undermines investment, growth, and social progress, and also 
s t rong ly damages V ie tnam 's image in te rna t iona l ly , has taken a s t rong resolve t o fight 
co r rup t ion . T h e in t roduc t ion o f the first L a w o n Co r rup t ion P reven t ion and C o n t r o l was 
a k e y step in the n ew strategy.6 The l a w ho lds senior c i v i l servants d i rec t ly responsible 
f o r co r rup t ion in the units that they oversee. I t also facilitates wh is t le -b low ing and 
introduces a mechan ism t o m o n i t o r the assets o f p u b l i c o f f i c i a l s and the i r immed ia te 
fam i l ies . Howeve r , the effectiveness o f th is mechan ism v e r y m u c h w i l l depend o n the 
specifics. I t s impac t w i l l b e fully achieved o n l y i f i t i s focused o n the mos t vulnerable 

The Provincial Competitiveness Index study developed by the Vietnam Chamber o f Commerce and 
Industry and the USAID-funded Vietnam Competitiveness Initiative assesses and r a n k s 42 provincial 
governments by their regulatory environments for private sector development, controlling for differences in 
in i t ia l endowments. 
The Law on Corruption Prevention and Control was passed by the National Assembly in November 2005 
and took e f f e c t in June 2006.

40. T o reduce the opportunities for corrupt behavior, i t w i l l also be important to 
continue to strengthen key government systems. T h e in t roduc t ion o f the One-Stop- 
Shop in i t ia t ive , undertaken as pa r t o f the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion r e f o rm program, was 
ins t rumen ta l in reduc ing the oppo r tun i t ies f o r graft. T h e PFM r e f o rm p rog ram has l e d t o

A recent scandal around Project Management Unit 18 in the Ministry o f Transport involving the appropriation 
o f funds from public investment projects by high-level officials to gamble on European football matches, also has been 
taken as an indication that resources are diverted within the state. T h e government i s investigating this case, the details 
o f which were widely reported i n the Vietnamese press and which has already led to the dismissal o f several high-level 
officials. T h e result o f the investigation as well as the Bank’s concomitant Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) w i l l 
shed further light on the prevalence o f corruption. 

A fiduciary review carried out in 2003 o f 400 contracts i n Vietnam under 6 World Bank credits uncovered no 
irregularities in financial management or disbursements and found the overall quality o f the physical works under the 
credits acceptable. However, indicators consistent with collusion among bidders were found in most o f the transactions 
reviewed. T h e findings o f the 2003 review were used to develop a set o f concrete measures to increase transparency, 
accountability, and competition i n the Bank project implementation process, while reducing the opportunities for 
fraudulent and collusive behavior. 

E. SEDP 2006-10 AS VIETNAM’S NEXT PRSP 

41. The SEDP i s Vietnam’s new Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS). As such, i t s 
strategic focus and p roposed pa th were assessed in the I M F - W o r l d Bank Jo in t S t a f f 
A d v i s o r y N o t e (JSAN) and discussed by the B o a r d o n December 5,2006. 

42. The JSAN noted that the SEDP i s fully embedded in the government’s 
mainstream planning processes. The d i rec t ions set by the SEDP a re b road ly sound and 
likely t o generate g r ow t h and reduce pove r ty . The SEDP also covers the m a i n PRS 
p r inc ip les : inco rpo ra t ing a pove r ty focus and a results orientation. The p repa ra t ion 
process has been open and participatory, representing a s ign i f ican t change in approach t o 
ma ins t ream p lann ing . 

43. The SEDP covers a range of policy areas and includes an a r ray of measures 
for each of them. T o guide donor support to Vietnam ove r the c om i n g years and t o he lp

44. 
Improving the efficiency and transparency o f investments, and strengthening 
governance remain important challenges. The con t inued r a p i d economic g r ow t h 
envisaged in the SEDP i s unde rp inned by high rates o f investment. Some o f the mos t 
impo r tan t recommendations in the JSAN relate t o the in t roduc t ion o f measures that 
p ro tec t the e f f ic iency o f inves tmen t and the transparency o f inves tmen t decision-making. 

45. The governance agenda remains p r o f o u n d l y challenging. Re fo rms are w e l l under 
w a y t o p romo te m o r e transparent and accountable PFM at a l l leve ls o f government. 
Service units are n o w b e i n g held m o r e accountable f o r the q u a l i t y o f services. T h e lega l 
and j u d i c i a l r e f o rm agenda has been less r a p i d and shou ld b e accelerated. Co r rup t ion and 
perceptions o f high co r rup t ion represent two o f the mos t s ign i f ican t r isks t o g r ow t h and 
sustained p o v e r t y reduc t ion ove r the n e x t f i v e years. T h e government i s h l l y aware o f 
the threat that co r rup t ion poses t o the achievement o f p lanned outcomes. D o n o r support 
t o s im p l i f y and strengthen im p r o v e d government systems w i l l be an impo r tan t part o f the 
so lu t ion . 

46. Although growth w i l l continue to reduce poverty, there a re some persistent 
pockets of poverty that growth alone w i l l not tackle. M o s t no tab ly , these pockets 
inc lude entrenched pove r ty among ethnic m ino r i t ies . Measures t o tack le ethnic m i n o r i t y 
p o v e r t y c o u l d useh l ly b e reassessed, since the s low ra te o f progress suggests that n o t a l l 
past measures have been effective. As pove r ty falls, strong ta rge t ing techniques w i l l 
become inc reas ing ly va luab le in the fight against pe rs is t ing pove r ty . I t i s necessary t o 
ensure that the target p rog rams are w e l l mon i to red and adapted when p rob lems emerge. 
The w o r k that the M i n i s t r y o f F inance (MOF) and M i n i s t r y o f P lann ing and Inves tmen t 
(MPI) have undertaken in the past f ew years t o rev ise the a l loca t ion no rms f o r recurrent

landlessness among farmers hit by adverse shocks, and r a p i d u rban iza t ion m a y lead t o

47. The Joint Staff Advisory Note concluded that (a) the SEDP has inco rpo ra ted the 
necessary elements o f PRS p r inc ip les and i s a plan that can b o t h de l ive r g r ow t h and

Box 4.1 Implementing Vietnam’s CAS: What Worked Well and What Worked L e s s Well 

What Worked Well 

Strong country ownership of the development agenda has been a key factor behind Vietnam’s development 

achievements and should continue to be the driving principle for all Bank activities. Institutional and policy 
reforms are sustainable only when the country fu l ly commits itself and decides to pursue them. Thorough 
consensus building within Vietnam i s imperative i n this regard, but the Bank can nurture the process through 
carefully timed and targeted advice, such as happened for anticorruption and banking reform. T h e CPS w i l l 
support reforms that are prioritized in the new five-year plan for 2006-10. 
Effective development partnership. Government ownership i s also key for the effective development 
partnerships among government, national stakeholders, and donors, another characteristic and strength o f 
Vietnam country program. T h e Vietnam country team needs to preserve this strength and deepen and broaden 
these partnerships. 
Understandingpovei$y. Understanding poverty i n Vietnam continues to be improved through analytical 
work that increasingly i s nationally owned. Recent poverty assessments have been conducted jo in t ly by the 
government, Vietnamese academic institutions, donors, and NGOs. T h e latest update was done entirely by 
the Vietnamese Academy o f Social Sc iences . T h e result has been a shared understanding o f the nature and 
causes o f poverty, including on the need to improve the poverty targeting o f public investments. 

Use of high quality AAA to impactpolicy dialogue. T h e A A A program was used strategically to advance 

Vietnam’s reform agenda. T h e processes and products were used to engage key policy-makers, academics, 
and the business community. Analytical p ieces were disseminated to-and often carried out with-targeted 
constituents to identify options for key policy decisions. For example, the design o f new policies to make 
basic social services more affordable to the poor was supported by a number o f A A A interventions. T h e 
principles o f providing high quality analyses for policy-makers’ debate rather than imposing a course o f 
action worked well in Vietnam. T h i s approach need to be maintained. 
Bank ’s role as convener and catalyst. T h e World Bank group has played an effective role o f convener and 
catalyst for policy dialogues. Biannual Consultative Group (CG) meetings with government agencies, 
donors, businesses, and NGOs, co-chaired by GoV and the Bank; youth initiatives; and partnerships with 
NGOdacademia have expanded and deepened the scope o f dialogue. These dialogues w i l l be continued in 
the new CPS period. 

What Worked Less Well 

Exp l ic it results framework to link bank activities to Go V objectives and facilitate selectivity. T h e absence 

o f an explicit resu l ts framework i n the existing CAS complicated specific evaluations o f its effectiveness, and 
limited its usefulness as a management tool. To support Vietnam’s poverty strategy, the new Country 
Partnership Strategy w i l l use an explicit results framework based on the government’s monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) framework 

Pace ofpolicy reforms for thef inanc ia l sector and SOEs . While the country has made steady progress in 

many areas o f the reform program, the pace has been slower in certain key, sensitive areas. On the economic 
reform agenda, a slower pace o f financial sector and SOE reform was noticeable. Vietnam’s WTO 
accession, however, puts an extra premium to accelerate progress. T h e recent adoption o f an ambitious 
banking reform roadmap has been an encouraging development, and one o f the key objectives o f the new 
CPS i s to support its firm implementation. 

Addressing poverty among ethnic minorities and urban migrants. Recent poverty assessments have 

demonstrated that poverty i s not being reduced at a sufficient pace among certain ethnic minorities, 
particularly in the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands, and in pockets o f deep poverty within cities, 
particularly those associated with migrants. T h e JSAN also highlights ethnic minority poverty as an area o f 
deep concern. T h e Bank i s continuing to work closely with government to ensure more effective policy 
responses, including to increase the access o f urban residents, particularly unregistered migrants, to 
government services and to p i lo t new, more effectively targeted subsidies and output-based aid modalities. 
Preparation and implementation ofprojects. As envisaged in the last CAS, the pace o f preparation and 
implementation o f projects needs to be further improved. While addressing routine and periodic delays has 
increased disbursements, systemic issues remain. Strengthening Vietnam’s investment approval and 
implementation processes i s critical. Vietnam needs to emphasize much more strongly building the capacity 
o f the counterpart entities to manage investment projects systematically, including their financial, labor, and 
technical capabilities to meet operations and maintenance needs.

Two client surveys were conducted during the current CAS period, one in 2003 and second in 2005 . Respondents 
were asked about Bank’s work and effectiveness in the country, general issues facing Vietnam, the Bank’s 
communication outreach efforts and its CAS consultations. The 2005 survey received responses from 2 7 9 (43%) o f the 
657 stakeholders surveyed. Government employees accounted for the bulk o f the respondents (43%), followed by 
NGOs and academics (1 2% each). 
Only countries with more than 10 projects were evaluated and compared.

v. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

5 5 . CPS in support o f the SEDP. B o t h B a n k lend ing and non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies are

56. Bridging first-generation and second-generation reforms to move Vietnam 
toward middle-income country (M IC ) status. T o accomp l ish i t s goa l o f becom ing a

and imp rovemen ts in the q u a l i t y o f p rog rams and services f o r the p o o r and vulnerable. 
These re fo rms w i l l r em a i n as the core o f the n ew CPS, with m u c h o f the Bank assistance

" Vietnam issued its first international government bond in October 2005 in the amount o f $750 m i l l ion . T h e 10-year 
dollar-denominated bonds were priced at 98.223% with a coupon o f 6.875% to yield 7.125%. T h i s was 256.4 basis 
points above comparable 10-year US Treasuries, and the spread obtained by Vietnam i s lower than that o f Indonesia 
and Philippines. Given the country's level o f economic development and that this was a first-time offering, the outcome 
o f the bond issuance i s considered favorable.

A. PILLAR 1 : IMPROV ING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

61. 
Improving competitiveness with full integration with the world economy, a 
more leve l playing field, a better foundation for knowledge-based growth, and 
enhanced agricultural competitiveness. In teg ra t ion in the w o r l d economy has been a 
m a i n d r ive r o f economic r e f o rm in Vietnam. Desp i te considerable progress, the country’s 
p ro tec t ion rates r em a i n high. Further l ibe ra l iza t ion shou ld increase e f f ic iency . Ano the r 
obstacle t o business development i s a customs department focused o n c o n t r o l (legal o r

economy, SOEs rema in ing in state hands need t o be managed at arms length f r om the

rights (IPR). These changes w i l l boos t p r o d u c t i v i t y in the m e d i um t o l o n g term. 

62. A s in teg ra t ion with the g loba l economy proceeds, the na tu re o f s k i l l s requ i red w i l l 
also change. Enhanc ing the education system t o better and f l e x i b l y respond t o these 
changes w i l l h e l p V i e t n am establish the basis f o r a modern, knowledge-based economy 
that w i l l extend far beyond the CPS pe r iod . With three-quarters o f the popu la t ion living 
in r u r a l areas, enhancing the competitiveness o f the ag r icu l tu ra l sector w i l l also continue 
t o be o f v i t a l importance. The easy gains

Generate an 
improved analytical base for 
implementing the WTO 
obligations and understanding their possible social implications (AAA, TA, 
PRSCs, Multi D o n o r Trust Fund f o r pos t WTO issues) 

Deepen its integration into the world economy through IFC’s support to 
foreign direct investments, trade finance, and South-South investments 

Modernize the customs administration, resu l t ing in reduced shipment clearance

Expand the social safety net program fo r redundant SOE workers and 
increase the number of equitized SOEs, with model privatization of large 
SOEs (PRSCs, TA, AAA, IFC ’s investments) 

Improve the quality, efficiency, and equity of the higher education system to 
produce relevant skill sets and increase the proportion of graduate students

64. M o r e efficient and reliable provision of infrastructure services. At the 
beg inn ing o f the reforms, Vietnam h a d a d i lap ida ted infrastructure. Since then, the 
coun t ry has coped w e l l w i th a 16 percent annual g r ow t h ra te in e lec t r ic i ty demand and 
has run one o f the mos t successful r u r a l e lec t r i f ica t ion p rog rams in the wo r ld .

65. Howeve r , the needs are enormous, and the p u b l i c sector alone cannot cope (Box

m o r e accountable t o their l i n e ministries, 
the beneficiaries, and the external 
oversight agencies such as the State Audit. The B a n k w i l l con t inue t o w o r k with the 
government and other donors t o strengthen the p ro jec t management system so that

areas. 
Procurement management. Since the Procurement L a w was issued, the Bank has 
w o r k e d with gove rnmen t and other partners t o develop the P u b l i c Procurement

A strong ana ly t ica l p rog ram has been ca r r ied ou t in cooperation with l o c a l ins t i tu t ions

engagement has enabled the W o r l d B a n k t o a l i g n i t s e l f beh ind gove rnmen t - led strategies. 
The process has also enhanced the openness o f the domestic p o l i c y -m a k i n g process. 
Evidence-based analysis, a strong p o v e r t y focus, ample consu l ta t ion with stakeholders,

D. PARTNERSHIPS, AID EFFECTIVENESS, AND PARTICIPATION 

102. Partnership: Building on past successes. V ie tnam ’s success in f o rm i n g w e l l - 
coordinated and e f fec t ive development partnerships i s w e l l known and has been 
highlighted in the tw o High-Level Fo rums o n Aid Effectiveness h e l d in R om e and Paris. 
Vietnam receives ove r $3 b i l l i o n a year f r o m m o r e than 40 b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l 
donor ins t i tu t ions and NGOs (Annex 6). Aligning ODA m o r e c lose ly with the 
government’s development strategy and results 
f ramewo rk , while im p r o v i n g the 
country’s lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk f o r ODA, w i l l con t inue t o be a p r i o r i t y during 
the CPS period. At the same time, the current partnership architecture w i l l need t o evo lve 
in response t o the n ew ODA f ramewo rk and government’s strengthened capacity. 

103. The Bank Group w i l l continue to serve important coordinating and catalytic 
roles fo r ODA to Vietnam. The B a n k and I F C w i l l con t inue t o co-chair with 
government the b iannua l Consu l ta t ive G roup and Business F o r u m meetings, w h i c h have 
become impo r tan t vehicles f o r p o l i c y dialogue among government, p r iva te sector, and 
donor commun i ty . T h e Bank w i l l also continue t o lead the PRSC process, fac i l i ta te multi- 
donor credits and ana ly t ica l products, and assist government in ma in ta in ing the O D A 
partnership w o r k i n g groups.

104. Partnership w i l l continue to be the basis o f a l l types of Bank activities. Jo in t 
f inanc ing o f inves tmen t projects has been the strength o f the V i e t n am p o r t f o l i o . At a 
p ro jec t level, m o r e than a h a l f o f the Bank’s ongo ing inves tmen t p ro jec ts have co - 
f inanc ing arrangements with other development partners. In i t ia t ives such as the P u b l i c 
F inanc ia l Management Mode rn iza t ion , Educa t ion f o r All, and Fo res t ry Partnership a l l 
bene f i ted f r o m mu l t i -dono r support.” 

105. When m u l t i p l e donors support a c omm o n in i t ia t ive , transaction costs are reduced 
and p o l i c y coherence i s enhanced. A s no ted in a recent QAG review, the V i e t n am AAA 
p r o g r am also made a substantial con t r ibu t ion t o the development o f an understanding o f 
the w o r k i n g s o f the Vietnamese economy and the r e f o rm process among the larger dono r 
commun i ty , NGOs , and p ro fess iona l and academic communities. T h i s deepened 
understanding c o u l d n o t have been achieved w i t h o u t the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f other dono r 
partners. Co re diagnostic studies, such as the PEWIFA o f FY05 , have become j o i n t 
p roduc ts o f the government and donors. The Bank w i l l con t inue t o w o r k with other 
partners in deepening the p o l i c y dialogue with the government and de l ive r ing the 
ope ra t iona l programs. 

106. The PRSC has evolved as a partnership platform f o r policy dialogues. F r o m 4 
donors co - f inanc ing the f i r s t PRSC in 2002, the fifth PRSC has m o b i l i z e d n o t o n l y 11 co - 
f inanc ie rs with a t o t a l o f mo re than $120 m i l l i o n but also 19 donors ac t ive ly i n v o l v e d in 
the p o l i c y dialogues.’* The ac t ive pa r t ic ipa t ion by m a j o r donors f o r the coun t ry b rough t 
coherence t o the r e f o rm process and strengthened the content o f p o l i c y actions, especially 
o n cross-sectoral 
i s s u e s such as setting p u b l i c sector accounting standards and 
s im p l i f y i n g adm in is t ra t ive procedures. 

107. The Bank w i l l also continue to strengthen its partnership with c iv i l society. 
The V i e t n am I n n o v a t i o n D a y (VID), a loca l ized “Development M a r k e t Place” o rgan ized 
by the Bank , has p r o v e n a successful mechan ism f o r engaging in dialogues with 
eme rg ing N G O s in V ie tnam . T o date, fou r V I D s have been organized o n themes such as 
HIV/AIDS and d isab i l i ty , presenting 146 awards t o 122 l o c a l NGOs f o r the i r ac t iv i t ies . A 
tracer s tudy i s t o be conducted with the assistance o f SFR’s G l o b a l M a r k e t Place team. 
T h e Sm a l l Grants p rog ram also p rov ides an excellent oppo r tun i ty t o reach ou t t o 
grassroots groups w o r k i n g o n development issues. A n e tw o r k o f P u b l i c I n f o rm a t i o n

collaboration). 

Vietnam, however, i s n o t an a i d dependent country. A n n u a l ODA comm i tmen ts o n l y account fo r 
around 6% o f GDP . This p o s i t i o n has enabled V i e t n am to move q u i c k l y towards a mature a i d

T h e economic t rans i t ion during the p e r i o d was accompanied by an ins t i tu t iona l overhaul. 
P u b l i c financial management was s ign i f ican t ly strengthened in terms o f i n f o rm a t i o n

against co r rup t ion also gained momen tum . 

Many challenges s t i l l remain, howeve r . A l t h o u g h a p r om i s i n g and amb i t ious roadmap

Y e t there i s r o o m f o r imp rovemen t : The s l ow imp lemen ta t ion o f inves tmen t projects in

On the pos i t ive side, the focus o n ad jus t ing the strategy and reca l ib ra t ing the lend ing

commensurate with V ie tnam ’s increased IDA allocation. I t has also he lped prepare f o r a 
smoo th t rans i t ion t o the next C A S pe r iod . 

Lessons for future CAS 

Strong country ownership of the development agenda and program shou ld 
con t inue t o b e the driving p r i n c i p l e f o r a l l Bank ac t iv i t ies . Ins t i tu t iona l and p o l i c y 
re fo rms are o n l y sustainable when the coun t ry fully comm i ts i t s e l f and decides t o 
pursue them. Consensus building within Vietnam i s impe ra t ive in this regard, but the 
B a n k can nu r tu re this process th rough ca re fu l ly t im e d and targeted advice. Po l ic ies 
that are supported by the n ew f i v e year plan f o r 2006-2010 and m e t with widespread 
consensus during the consu l ta t ion process shou ld be supported and fac i l i ta ted by the 
Bank’s new C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy. 

Partnership with the Government, na t iona l stakeholders and other donors i s the 
strength o f the Banks’s coun t ry program. The team w i l l need t o preserve this strength 
and con t inue t o deepen and w i d e n these partnerships. 

The p o r t f o l i o i s increasing in l i n e with the increased IDA envelope f o r V ie tnam . 
W h i l e the p o r t f o l i o i s s t i l l young, i t w i l l undergo s ign i f ican t changes during the n e x t

Explicit Results Framework to link Bank activities to the Government’s 
Objectives and facilitate selectivity. The absence o f an e x p l i c i t results f ramewo rk

The CPRGS translated V ie tnam ’s Soc io -Econom ic Deve lopmen t Strategy o f 200 1-2005 
i n t o concrete measures and p rog rams and was the coun t ry ’s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Support

The CPRGS was structured around three p i l la rs :

A d o p t i o n o f a m o d e m administration, lega l a n d governance system. This 
requires a system whe reby p u b l i c finance and ins t i tu t ions are operated in 
transparent and p red ic tab le manner, p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions and p u b l i c are 
gove rned by l a w and are accounted f o r their undertakings. 

The CPRGS was expanded in December 2003 t o address issues related t o large 
scale infrastructure. An impo r tan t feature o f the CPRGS was the use o f loca l ized 
M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals t o develop a system o f na t iona l - leve l ind ica to rs t o 
m o n i t o r and evaluate progress in imp lemen t ing the Strategy. T h e loca l ized MDGs, the 
Vietnam Deve lopmen t Goals (VDGs), w h i c h in some cases are m o r e amb i t ious than the 
MDGs, are attached as Annex 1. 

A. Vietnam’s poverty reduction and growth achievements 

V ie tnam ’s macro-economic performance has been rema rkab ly strong with an 
average annual rea l GDP g r ow t h rate o f 7.8% during 2002-2005, s ing le -d ig i t i n f l a t i o n 
rates, and p ruden t f isca l performance, despite several exogenous shocks i n c l u d i n g the 
outbreak o f A v i a n Influenza, S A R S and o i l p r i c e increases w h i c h p r o v o k e d a sharp r ise 
in p r ices in 2004 and 2005. In per capita terms, this corresponds t o an annual GDP 
g r ow t h rate o f 6.1% between 2001-2005. T h e sustained econom ic g r ow t h has been d r i v e n 
by r a p i d expo r t growth, pa r t icu la r ly t o the U S , and buoyan t domestic activities, especially 
investments. Industry has been the fastest g r ow i n g economic sector, accompanied by 
r a p i d domestic p r iva te manu fac tu r ing g row th . 

Supported by the s t rong macro-economic pe r fo rmance and ac t ive p ro -poo r p o l i c y 
measures taken by the Government, the p o v e r t y rate has d ropped dramatically, f r o m 58% 
o f the popu la t ion in 1993 t o 29% in 2002 and further d o w n t o 19.5% in 2004. The fast 
p o v e r t y reduc t ion during the C A S p e r i o d i s in l i n e with the acceleration o f economic 
g row th , and might also re f lec t the increasing size o f budget transfers t o poo re r provinces, 
greater emphasis o n remo te areas in the p u b l i c inves tmen t programs, and the r ise in the 
w o r l d p r ices o f ag r icu l tu ra l expo r t commod i t ies such as co f fee and r ice . O the r ind ica to rs

There has been l i t t l e o r n o increase in inequa l i ty acco rd ing t o standard measures. 
The Gini index, at 0.37, has n o t va r ied since 2002 and i s o n l y s l i g h t l y higher than in 1998 
w h e n i t stood at 0.35. The r a t i o that compares the consump t ion expenditures o f the

and 2004. In 2002, the share o f expenditures made by the richest tw e n t y percent o f the 
p o p u l a t i o n was 6.03 t imes the expenditures made by the poorest tw e n t y percent. In 2004,

These imp ress ive achievements in reduc ing p o v e r t y and the absence o f striking 
increases in inequa l i ty s i t alongside s lowe r progress f o r an impo r tan t sub-group o f the

Country Outcome: Strengthen the integration with the world economy 

Outcome performance. Highly satisfactory progress towa rds the ou tcome has 
been achieved, with s o l i d progress o n mos t o f the ind ica to rs in Tab le 1. There has been 
s ign i f ican t ly greater openness t o trade, with the r a t i o o f exports t o GDP inc reas ing f r o m 
47% in 2001 t o 61% in 2005, surpassing the target set f o r 2006, and also with 
substantially h ighe r share o f manufactured p roduc ts and p r iva te sector exports in to ta l 
exports, w h i l e n o t yet reach ing the v e r y amb i t ious targets set f o r 2006. The Government 
locked in i t s in ten t ion t o create a mo re open and compe t i t ive economy by imp lemen t ing 
i t s comm i tmen ts under the ASEAN Free Trade A r e a (AFTA), and the United States 
B i l a t e r a l Trade Ag reemen t (USBTA ) . The comm i tmen t o f the Gove rnmen t has rema ined 
s t rong with the declared ob jec t ive t o j o i n the WTO as ea r ly as possible. With a l l b i la te ra l 
negotiations n o w concluded, accession i s expected by October 2006. The accession w i l l 
requ i re de te rm ined and comprehensive economic, lega l and ins t i tu t iona l behind the 
bo rde r re fo rms . 

Bank contribution. As 
the WTO -access ion became a cornerstone o f 
Government’s economic and structural re fo rm , the Bank G roup increased i t s support, as 
compared t o wha t was expected at the time o f the 2002 CAS , th rough the PRSC -p rog ram 
and a va r ie ty o f AAA w o r k . The assistance p rog ram was p r o v i d e d in close partnership 
with other ac t ive donors, i n c l u d i n g the European Commission, Japan and the U S A . The 
B a n k p r o v i d e d comprehensive ana ly t ica l support t o the Gove rnmen t in establishing and 
im p l em e n t i n g a roadmap f o r W T O accession, with a l i s t o f spec i f ic p o l i c y actions and a 
t ime tab le f o r implementation, and strategic and ana ly t ica l advice 
t o assess the 
consequences o f va r ious p o l i c y choices. A study o f V ie tnam ’s expo r t p o l i c y and 
performance, and o n transport and trade f a c i l i t a t i o n was also conducted. The AAA 
ac t iv i t ies we re comp lemen ted by a comprehensive set o f t ra in ing courses and other

as well as trade p o l i c y courses f o r k e y M i n i s t r i e s and institutes. 

As the focus has g radua l ly shifted t o imp lemen ta t ion rather than design issues, the 
B a n k also ca r r ied ou t studies assessing the p o v e r t y and social impac t o f WTO accession. 
A Customs M o d e r n i z a t i o n p ro jec t (FY06 ) was prepared t o help V i e t n am develop a

Country Outcome: Strengthen the capacity of the f inanc ia l sector to allocate credit on 
a sound basis 

Outcome performance. Only p a r t i a l l y satisfactory progress 
towa rds th is 
ou tcome has been achieved, based o n the ind ica to rs and targets set in the PRSC-program. 
O n the p o s i t i v e side, confidence 
in the bank ing system in general has g r ow n rap id ly , the 
paymen t system has im p r o v e d considerably, c red i t t o the p r iva te sector has increased t o 
67 percent f r o m 5 8 percent in 2001, and c red i t t o the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) 
sector has fa l len substantially. Howeve r , the share o f non -pe r fo rm ing loans (NPLs) 
remains high as a f rac t ion o f to ta l credit, and i s g r ow i n g as a f rac t ion o f GDP, and 
assessments based o n I A S audits suggest that the ove ra l l q u a l i t y o f the SOCB p o r t f o l i o i s

SOCBs th rough the c rea t ion o f the V i e t n am B a n k f o r Soc ia l Po l ic ies (VBSP ) and the

expected t o add c ruc ia l m om e n t um t o the r e f o rm process. In particular, the r o a d map 
mandates by 2010 the issuance o f new laws f o r the S B V and C red i t Ins t i tu t ions based o n

Country outcome: Reform SOE’s to strengthen their efJciency and competitiveness 

Outcome performance. O n l y p a r t i a l l y satisfactory progress 
towa rds this 
ou tcome has been achieved. The d ives t i tu re process has recen t ly been p roceed ing at a 
faster pace than before, and there i s an i n d i c a t i o n that owne rsh ip t rans fo rma t ion has been 
associated with m o r e substantive res t ruc tu r ing at present, as re f lec ted in the ope ra t ion o f 
the soc ia l safety ne t f o r redundant SOE workers. W h i l e the amb i t ious nume r ica l targets 
o f the SOE res t ruc tu r ing plans o f 2002 have n o t been met, m o r e than 3,000 SOEs have 
been equ i t ized ove r the last 4 years. I n i t i a l l y , the focus o f equ i t iza t ion h a d been o n 
sma l le r SOEs, but in 2004 the l i s t sectors whe re 100 percent state owne rsh ip i s t o b e 
re ta ined was substantially shortened. Since then, the average size o f the SOEs 
t rans fo rmed has been rising. T h e equ i t iza t ion process has i t s e l f undergone m a j o r 
imp rovemen ts with appraisals b e i n g conducted by outside evaluators, and the share sales 
taking place at ma rke t values th rough auctions at the securities t rad ing centers. T h e 
percentage o f shares so ld t o non-employees o r t o outsiders ( inc lud ing foreigners) has also 
been increasing. E l im i n a t i o n o f d i rec t subsidies, 
increased compe t i t ion in p roduc t 
ma rke ts and, t o a ce r ta in extent, the hardening o f the budget constraint, also seems t o 
have been exe r t ing pressure o n SOEs t o become m o r e competitive, as evidenced in a 
su rvey o f 550 equ i t ized SOEs conduced in 2005, f o l l ow i n g a s im i la r one undertaken two 
years earlier. A lm o s t 90 percent o f those sampled repo r ted an imp rovemen t in the i r 
f inanc ia l performance, starting p r om p t l y o n equitization, tu rnove r increased 13 percent 
o n average and p re - tax p r o f i t s by 9 percent. These gains are higher than those observed 
among non -equ i t ized SOEs. 

On the other hand, there has been less progress in reso lv ing debts unde r the Deb ts 
and A s s e t s T rad ing Company f ramewo rk and in limiting the p r o v i s i o n o f p re fe ren t ia l 
c red i t f r o m the SOCBs. Imp rovemen t o f the e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c u t i l i t i e s was also a part

Country Outcome: Establish a more level p lay ing f ie ld to support the development of

Outcome performance. Satisfactory progress towa rds th is ou tcome has been 
achieved, as compared t o the amb i t ious targets se t ou t in the CPRGSPRSC . The flip side 
o f SOE reform, and a key aspect o f the t rans i t ion t o a ma rke t economy, has been the 
rising r o l e o f the p r iva te sector. Im p r o v e d business c l ima te has been re f lec ted in the 
g r ow t h o f f o rm a l l y registered domestic p r iva te f i r m s . In the last f i v e years, about 146 
thousand new domestic enterprises we re registered, w i th almost 40,000 registered alone 
in 2005. The average cap i ta l o f these enterprises, at a round 160,000 U S D in 2005, 
remains sma l l by in te rna t iona l standards. But i t has m o r e than doub led in compa r ison 
with 2001. The re la t ive share o f the p r iva te business in the economy has increased 
s ign i f ican t ly . Be tween 2001 and 2005 the share o f the p r iva te sector in n o n - o i l exports 
rose f r o m 44 percent t o 77 percent. P r iva te enterprises, exc lud ing farmers and non - fa rm 
self-employment, n o w account f o r about 22 percent o f the emp loyed labo r force, 
compared t o 13 percent in 1998. S im i la r ly , the number o f peop le emp loyed in the p r iva te 
sector has increased f r o m a round 0.6 m i l l i o n in 2001 t o 2.8 m i l l i o n in 2005, and the r a t i o 
o f p r iva te inves tmen t t o GD P has r isen f r o m 14 percent in 2001 t o 18 percent in 2005. 
W h i l e these f i g u r e s are s t i l l b e l ow the amb i t ious targets se t at the onset o f the C A S period, 
they ind ica te s ign i f ican t progress nevertheless. Ove r the C A S pe r iod , several p o l i c y 
actions t o l e v e l the p l a y i n g f i e l d f o r access t o land, capital, and p u b l i c contracts were

Country Outcome: Raising the living standards of ethnic minorities 
Outcome performance. Only p a r t i a l l y satisfactory progress towards 
th is 
ou tcome has been achieved. E thn ic m i n o r i t y p o v e r t y i s reduc ing and access t o basic 
services by ethnic m ino r i t ies i s imp rov ing . M o s t recent data show, f o r example, that the 
net primary schoo l en ro l lmen t gap has fa l len f r o m 12 percent in 1998 t o 10 percent in 
2004. But in a l l regions o f Vietnam, ethnic m ino r i t ies fare far wo rse than the Kinh 
m a j o r i t y popu la t ion , and pove r ty reduc t ion has been m o r e r a p i d f o r the Kinh and Chinese 
populations, even in remo te and mountainous areas. In 2004, 14 percent o f the Kinh and 
Chinese peop le we re l iv ing in poverty, compared t o 6 1 percent o f ethnic m i n o r i t y people. 
Though accoun t ing f o r o n l y 13 percent o f the t o t a l popu la t ion , ethnic m ino r i t ies n o w 
constitute 39 percent o f the poo r . Their p o v e r t y i s deeper, too, than tha t o f other groups. 
The p o v e r t y gap f o r ethnic m ino r i t ies i s 19.2, compared t o o n l y 2.6 f o r Kinh people. 
U n e v e n progress in p o v e r t y reduc t ion be tween the Kinh m a j o r i t y and the ethnic 
m ino r i t ies translates i n t o impo r tan t gaps in the extent and depth o f pove r ty across 
regions. Fortunes o f ethnic m ino r i t ies vary across the coun t ry . W h i l e ethnic m i n o r i t y 
pove r ty has been o n a steady downwa rd trend in the no r the rn mountains, the trends are 
less pos i t ive in the r a p i d l y - g r ow i n g cen t ra l h igh lands reg ion .

The m e d i a has also taken a m o r e p roac t ive approach in detecting and r e p o r t i n g co r rup t ion

Based o n the findings o f the Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performance R e v i ew (CPPR) o f

The high risk f i d u c i a r y env i ronmen t in V i e t n am rema ins a k e y concern o f the

In response t o the findings, the coun t ry team has since imp lemen ted an

transparency, accoun tab i l i ty and compe t i t ion in the p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion process, 
while reduc ing oppo r tun i t ies f o r fraudulent and co l lus ive behavior.

(e) AAA Assessment - Delivery of High Impact AAA Program 

A robus t p rog ram o f ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies was undertaken during the

was highly relevant s t ra teg ica l ly f o r the country’s r e f o rm agenda. As the c l ien t surveys 
also indicated, the Bank’s adv iso ry r o l e based o n qua l i ty p roduc ts i s g rea t ly valued. 

N o t ew o r t h y are a series o f annual V i e t n am Deve lopmen t Reports, w h i c h takes up 
a subject each year. In 2003, ‘pove r ty ’ was the subject, f o l l ow e d by ‘governance’ in 
2004 and ‘business’ in 2005. The VDR series, p roduced in co l labo ra t ion with the 
Vietnamese think tanks and a numbe r o f donors, deepened the understanding o f c r i t i c a l 
i s s u e s such as p o v e r t y and impac t o f government po l ic ies . T h e Reports we re widely 
disseminated and discussed with va r ious stakeholders. 
I t i s also impo r tan t t o no te that 
d r a f t i n g o f these reports and d issem ina t ion are used as a process f o r building capacity o f 
l o c a l counterparts. F o r example, there i s an agreement that the n e x t pove r ty assessment 
w i l l b e conducted by the Vietnamese counterparts. 

The AAA p rog ram was also augmented s ign i f ican t ly by resources ra ised th rough 
t r u s t fund arrangements and by pa r tne r ing with the Government, l o c a l ins t i tu t ions and 
other donors. A b o u t 30% o f the ove ra l l AAA p rog ram i s f inanced th rough t r u s t funds. 
Howeve r , the impac t o f partnership far ou twe ighs the resources u t i l i z e d f o r the program. 
The partnership in delivering the AAA p rog ram has l e d t o a highly e f fec t ive 
Gove rnmen t -dono r dialogue as w e l l as serious capacity building e f fo r ts f o r Vietnamese

With the Gove rnmen t t a k i n g a s t rong leadership, s ign i f ican t progress has been 
made in establishing and implementing a comprehensive a i d effectiveness and 
ha rmon iza t ion agenda in Vietnam. At the High L e v e l Fo rums o n Aid Effectiveness h e l d

In 2005, a loca l ized ve rs ion o f the Paris Declaration, the so-called H a n o i Co re Statement, 
was adopted by the Gove rnmen t and the dono r commun i ty . T h e H a n o i Co re Statement 
sets ou t a numbe r o f j o i n t Government and dono r comm i tmen ts and targets t o be 
achieved by 2010 in the areas o f alignment, harmonization, m u t u a l accoun tab i l i ty and 
manag ing f o r results. One impo r tan t comm i tmen t w o r t h n o t i n g i s the fact that a l l donors 
have agreed t o a l i g n the i r programs with the n e x t 5 year Soc ia l Econom ic Deve lopmen t 
Plan (SEDP). 

Partnership has been embedded in a l l o f the B a n k instruments, f r o m ana ly t ica l

w h i c h has become a t o o l f o r an inc reas ing numbe r o f donors” t o discuss a wide range o f 
p o l i c y issues with the Government. PRSC4 (FY05 operation) was co-financed by 12 
donors i n c l u d i n g the European Commission, Japan and ADB. The core diagnostic 
studies such as the P u b l i c Expend i tu re R e v i ew o f F Y 0 5 have become j o i n t products o f 
the Gove rnmen t and donors with the Gove rnmen t taking the leadership. At the sector

the groups. On the external re la t ions activities, the V i e t n am Deve lopmen t I n f o rm a t i o n

V. Lessons for the next Country Assistance Strategy 

What Worked Well: 

Strong country ownership of the development agenda has been a k e y factor behind 
Vietnam’s development achievements and shou ld con t inue t o b e the driving p r i n c i p l e f o r 
a l l Bank activities. Ins t i tu t iona l and p o l i c y re fo rms a re o n l y sustainable when the coun t ry 
fully comm i ts i t s e l f and decides t o pu rsue them. Tho rough consensus building within 
V i e t n am i s impe ra t ive in this regard, but the B a n k can nu r tu re the process th rough 
ca re fu l ly t im e d and targeted advice, such as happened f o r an t i -co r rup t ion and banking 
re fo rm . 

Understanding Poverty. The understanding o f p o v e r t y in V i e t n am continues t o be 
im p r o v e d th rough ana ly t ica l w o r k that i s inc reas ing ly n a t i o n a l l y owned. Recent p o v e r t y 
assessments have been conducted j o i n t l y by the Government, Vietnamese academic 
ins t i tu t ions , donors and NGO’s, and the latest update was done en t i re ly by the 
Vietnamese Academy o f Soc ia l Sciences. The resu l t has been a shared understanding o f 
the nature and causes o f poverty, i n c l u d i n g o n the need t o im p r o v e the p o v e r t y ta rge t ing 
o f p u b l i c investments. 

U s e of high quality AAA to impact policy dialogue: The Bank team u t i l i z e d AAA 
s t ra teg ica l ly in advancing r e f o rm agenda. AAA processes and products were used in 
e f fec t ive ly engaging in dialogue with key p o l i c y makers, academics, business commun i ty , 
donors and NGOs o n k e y r e f o rm areas. T h e B a n k p r o v i d e d high qua l i ty ana ly t ica l pieces 
f o r targeted audiences f o r debate, o f f e r i n g choices f o r p o l i c y decisions. The p r inc ip les 
o f p r o v i d i n g high qua l i ty analyses f o r p o l i c y makers’ debate rather than impos ing o n a 
course o f actions w o r k e d w e l l in Vietnamese context. This approach w i l l need t o b e 
ma in ta ined . 

Expanded capacity in managing investment portfolio with decentralized support 
from the Bank: Vietnam has expanded i t s capacity t o manage a large Bank inves tmen t 
p o r t f o l i o ove r the past years. F o r the f i rs t t im e in FY05 , the coun t ry u t i l i z e d the full IDA 
a l loca t ion de l ive r ing mo re than seven inves tmen t projects a year. Safeguard po l ic ies and 
regu la t ions i n c l u d i n g procurement have been im p r o v e d and management capacity has 
been strengthened, a lbe i t s low ly . 
T h e B a n k supported the Government’s e f fo r ts by 
decen t ra l iz ing the operations with m o r e s t a f f in H a n o i manag ing tasks. 57% o f ongo ing 
p ro jec ts are being supervised by s ta f f based in Hano i . The strengthened capacity in the 
field con t r ibu ted t o im p r o v e d p o r t f o l i o management. 

Partnership: A s a C D F p i lo t , V i e t n am managed partnership ex t reme ly w e l l . D o n o r s 
have gathered a round PRSCs as a p l a t f o rm f o r p o l i c y dialogues and with strong coun t ry 
ownership. T h e Government and the dono r commun i ty , with the B a n k p l a y i n g an ac t ive 
role, have e f fec t ive ly come together in establishing a clear agenda f o r h o w t o enhance the 
Government-donor partnership and im p r o v e effectiveness o f a i d de l ive red t o V i e t n am 
th rough the H a n o i Co re Statement. The Bank ’s dialogues beyond the Gove rnmen t such

as with the business commun i ty , c i v i l society, press and academia have been expand ing 
in vo lume and substance. These interactions also feed back t o the d ia logue with the 
Government and generate hea l thy debates o n the coun t ry ’s econom ic and soc ia l 
development issues. 

Bank’s ro l e as convener and coordinator: The W o r l d B a n k g roup has p layed an 
e f fec t ive r o l e o f convener and coo rd ina to r f o r p o l i c y dialogues. C G and mid C G 
meetings, business fo rums organized by IFC , you th in i t ia t ives and partnership with 
NGO d a c a d em i a have con t r ibu ted t o expand and deepen the scope o f dialogues. 

What Worked L e s s Well: Need for Improvement for Next CAS 

Assessing results arising from the existing portfolio: The r e v i ew o f the p o r t f o l i o 
shows that 27 inves tmen t p ro jec ts prepared be fo re C A S we re b e i n g imp lemen ted during 
the C A S p e r i o d whereas o n l y 13 p ro jec ts w h i c h were discussed in the C A S as suppo r t ing

p ro jec ts have been imp lemen ted f o r less than two years t o date. With the p o r t f o l i o o f this 
m i x , i t i s n o t surprising t o see that mos t o f the results were generated by the p re -CAS 
projects. Howeve r , the C A S p a i d less a t ten t ion t o the impac ts o f the ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o

Establishing a realistic results framework: W h i l e Bank in te rven t ions have c lea r ly 
con t r ibu ted t o s ign i f ican t progress in a number o f CPRGS goals, documen t ing and 
quan t i fy ing these achievements has been a challenge. Desp i te the short t ime f rame o f the 
C A S and the l im i t e d B a n k resources, the C A S goals were set amb i t ious ly at the b road 
CPRGS na t iona l l e v e l with a re la t ive ly weak exp l ic i t link t o outcomes arising f r o m 
i n d i v i d u a l projects. The next C A S w i l l need t o establish a rea l is t ic results framework, 
with a m o r e e x p l i c i t results cha in linking operations with a set o f specific and 
mon i to rab le ind ica to rs re la t ing t o the Government’s M&E systems. 

U s e of CAS as a management tool: The C A S was designed with b r o a d objectives set at 
a na t iona l level, w h i c h a l l ow e d f o r the B a n k t o respond f l e x i b l y and q u i c k l y t o emerging 
challenges and requests f o r support such as r o a d safety and H I V / A I D s issues. Howeve r , 
this re la t ive lack o f spec i f ic i ty made i t d i f f i c u l t t o use the C A S as a day-to-day 
management too l . 
I t i s o n l y n o w that PDO s and K P I s are being discussed with specific 
C A S sub-theme objectives in mind. I t w i l l b e impo r tan t t o make the n e x t C A S a living 
document that can be used as an e f fec t ive management t o o l whereby i n c om i n g and

Pace of Policy Reforms for the Financial Sector and SOEs. W h i l e there has been 
steady progress in m a n y areas o f the r e f o rm program, the pace has been s lowe r than 
expected in the C A S in ce r ta in key, sensitive areas. On the economic r e f o r m agenda, th is

the Bank , impo r tan t areas f o r B a n k invo lvemen t , and the Bank ’s effectiveness. 
Respondents were also asked about general issues fac ing V ie tnam , the Bank’s 
commun ica t ion outreach efforts, and Bank ’s C A S consultations. Responses we re 
rece ived f r o m 279 (43%) o f the 657 stakeholders surveyed. Gove rnmen t employees 
accounted f o r the bulk o f the respondents (43%), but there was also a g o o d representation 
o f NGOs and academics (12% each), the p r iva te sector and donors. A s im i la r type o f 
su rvey was done in 2003 in p repa ra t ion f o r the F Y 0 4 C A S Progress Repo r t . 

7. Results f r o m the 2005 survey demonstrated that there i s a con t inued pos i t ive 
pe rcep t ion o f the B a n k in V i e t n am among stakeholders. W h e n asked t o p rov ide their 
imp ress ion o f the Bank’s effectiveness in V ie tnam , stakeholders ra ted the Bank 7.7 (on a 
scale o f 1 t o 10 with 1 b e i n g v e r y un favo rab le and 10 b e i n g v e r y favorable), a s l i g h t 
imp rovemen t ove r a 7.5 r a t i n g in FY03 . Gove rnmen t employees gave the highest ra t ings 
o n B a n k effectiveness, and the respondents f r o m the dono r c omm u n i t y gave the Bank 
slightly l ow e r ratings. On a scale with 1 b e i n g strong disagreement and 10 being strong 
agreement, respondents gave a r a t i n g o f 8.2 w h e n asked whe the r the Bank cu r ren t ly p lays 
a re levan t r o l e f o r development in V ie tnam . Respondents also gene ra l ly agreed that the 
B a n k i s an e f fec t ive catalyst f o r discussions o n poverty, that i t w o r k s t o re f lec t i t s o w n 
m i s s i o n o n pove r ty reduction, and that stakeholders like t o in te rac t /wo rk with Bank staff. 
The Bank was seen as becom ing easier t o w o r k with, with the score f o r the cost and t im e

8. T h e survey ind ica ted that the Bank continues t o have an impo r tan t r o l e t o p l a y in a 
range o f development areas in Vietnam, i n c l u d i n g economic growth, t rans i t ion ing t o a 
ma rke t economy, deve lop ing the social sectors, and im p r o v i n g governance. Respondents 
saw in f ras t ruc tu re development, pove r ty reduction, economic g row th , and assisting the 
t rans i t ion t o a ma rke t economy as some o f the Bank ’s strengths, whereas Bank ac t iv i t ies 
in the education and hea l th sectors were pe rce ived as r e l a t i v e l y less e f fec t ive . 

9. Respondents also gave favorable ra t ings t o the Bank’s e f fo r ts t o safeguard against 
co r rup t ion in i t s o w n p ro jec ts and did n o t see co r rup t ion as a m a j o r p r o b l em within B a n k 
operations. Howeve r , helping G o V reduce co r rup t ion in the coun t ry th rough advice and 
ana ly t ica l w o r k was seen as an impo r tan t area f o r imp rovemen t . At the same time, 
reduc ing co r rup t ion coun t ry -w ide was i d e n t i f i e d as a k e y development p r io r i ty , a long

i t s importance was ranked b e l ow b o t h g r ow t h and governance issues. This represents a 
shift in perceptions f r o m FY03 , where pove r ty reduc t ion was ranked as the mos t 
impo r tan t challenge. 

10. In the n ew survey, f inanc ia l transfers we re v iewed as the mos t va luab le type o f Bank 
assistance, as was the case in FY03 . Howeve r , in the n ew su rvey stakeholders 
inc reas ing ly saw va lue in o the r types o f assistance as well. N e a r l y h a l f o f a l l respondents

Be tween the FY 0 3 and the F Y 0 6 (05?) surveys, however, the share o f respondents w h o 
saw finances the as greatest va lue decreased w h i l e those w h o saw p o l i c y advice as the

1 1. The c l ien t su rvey was f o l l ow e d by focused in te rv iews with a numbe r o f stakeholders 
in cen t ra l Government, l o c a l Governments, and c i v i l society. 

12. In general, interviewees con f i rmed the c l ien t survey’s pos i t ive v i e w o f the Bank,

Consultations with Government 

17. In September 2006, a f o rm a l CPS consu l ta t ion retreat was organized. G o V o f f ic ia ls 
f r o m the MPI, MOF, SBV , tw e n t y other l i n e m in is t r ies and agencies pa r t ic ipa ted in 
discussions with Bank s ta f f conce rn ing the next CPS f o r V ie tnam . 

18. From Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS): T h e retreat was built o n the two -yea r consu l ta t ion process o f strategizing the 
coun t ry ’s development p a t h t o 2010, w h i c h cu lm ina ted in the Socio Econom ic 
Deve lopmen t P l a n (SEDP) o f 2006 - 2010, and the Bank’s support f o r that path. 
R e f l e c t i n g the partnership that the Gove rnmen t and the Bank h a d built in recent years, the 
strategy w o u l d b e titled the C o u n t r y Partnership Strategy. Government representatives 
appreciate this change. 

19. Lessons Learned: The Bank ’s in te rna l and eva lua t ion department has evaluated the 
W o r l d B a n k assistance as h a v i n g sustainable impac ts at the ins t i tu t iona l and p o l i c y l e v e l 
as well as the i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec t leve l . The B a n k also en joyed broad-based support in the 
country, as evidenced by the t w o recent c l ien t surveys. Howeve r , s low p ro jec t 
im p l em e n t i n g diminished the development impac t . The G o V and the B a n k agreed o n the 
need t o w o r k in finding ways t o streamline the process and accelerate p ro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion . The recent w o r k o n l e g a l and regu la to ry r e f o rm o f inves tmen t 
management and imp lemen ta t ion w o u l d b e a good basis f o r h r t h e r w o r k in this regard. 
20. Aligning CPS to SEDP -- from Plan to Action: The clear a l ignmen t o f the CPS 
concept no te t o the SEDP was appreciated by the Government. The fou r p i l l a r s o f CPS -- 
business development, strengthened social inc lus ion , and env i ronmen t management with 
strengthening o f governance as the founda t ion - - were v iewed by the Gove rnmen t 
representatives as appropriate and re f lec t ive o f the Bank ’s comparative advantage. The 
SEDP w i l l b e ope ra t iona l ized and imp lemen ted in accordance with the Government’s 
A c t i o n Plan, and the Vietnam Deve lopmen t Repo r t 07 w i l l b e used as a roadmap. T h e 
n e x t five years w i l l complete the f i rs t generation re fo rms and i n i t i a t e the second 
generation re fo rms . 

2 1. Selectivity: The B a n k assistance, w h i l e expanded s ign i f ican t ly ove r the years, w o u l d 
finance o n l y a part o f SEDP’s inves tmen t needs. The Government accepted the Bank ’s 
c r i te r ia f o r selecting p ro jec ts based o n compa ra t ive advantage, outcome, sca lab i l i ty and 
sector performance. G o V w o u l d se t the p r i o r i t y f o r the Bank assistance taking i n t o 
account the ava i lab i l i ty o f other donors’ support. A H a n o i Compact t o fo rma l ize the 
a l ignmen t o f donors’ strategy t o the SEDP w i l l be further discussed among donors and 
with the Government. 

22. Implementation Issues: With decentralization, the emphasis during the CPS p e r i o d 
w i l l be o n strengthening the capac i ty o f ins t i tu t ions at the l o c a l leve l . At the same time, 
g i v e n the strengthened lega l f ramewo rk f o r inves tmen t projects, procurement, and

Bank w i l l b e rev iewed t o W h e r streamline the process. 

23. Regular review of performance using the Results Framework: An annual r e v i ew 
o f CPS pe r fo rmance was p lanned by the Bank, using the results f ramewo rk developed f o r 
CPS. The Bank r e v i ew w o u l d c lose ly build o n t o the MPI’s r e v i ew o f SEDP progress. 
T h e Gove rnmen t and the Bank agreed t o use these annual rev iews as a means f o r 
ad jus t ing the p o r t f o l i o and fu tu re p ipe l ine . 

24. Transition from I D A to IBRD lending: W h i l e g radua t ion f r o m IDA w o u l d n o t

was f o r greater selectivity. Bus iness leaders urged the Bank G roup n o t t o try t o resolve a l l

those are g radua l ly opened in accordance with V ie tnam ’s b i la te ra l and 
m u l t i l a t e r a l comm i tmen ts unde r WTO. Business leaders acknow ledged the need 
f o r n ew and better regulations, but they emphasized the impo r tance o f focussing 
o n imp lemen ta t ion . A recurrent suggestion was the impo r tance o f strengthening 
implementation, especially at the l o c a l level, and en fo rc ing the capac i ty o f l o c a l 
government agencies. 

0 Anti-corruption. A number o f business leaders suggested that the B a n k G roup 
p r o v i d e mo re p rac t ica l support f o r an t i -co r rup t ion programs. I t was o f t e n

enhancing 
the

see a greater emphasis o n cou r t and j u d i c i a l re fo rm . 

0 Equitization. While recogn iz ing past progress in equitization, a numbe r o f 
business leaders f e l t that there s t i l l i s a need f o r mo re support f r o m in te rna t iona l 
organizations in t h i s po l icy , as i t i s an impo r tan t and sensitive issue. They also

The SEDP was fo rmu la ted based o n an extensive pa r t ic ipa t ion by a b r o a d range o f stakeholders. 
The Gove rnmen t organized three reg iona l workshops and several consultations, i n c l u d i n g with

8. 
Aligning aid flows with national priorities. During the 2005 C G meeting, external 
partners agreed t o a l i g n their development assistance strategies t o the Government’s 2006 -1 0 
SEDP as i t s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS). Ex te rna l partners supported the Gove rnmen t in

B a n k and the ADB have developed the i r C o u n t r y Assistance Strategies in support o f the SEDP. 
The UN Deve lopmen t Assistance F ramewo rk 2006-10 t o support the 2006-10 SEDP was

10. Building reliable country systems. The first steps t ow a r d the use o f coun t ry systems 
are t o strengthen p u b l i c f inanc ia l management and budge t execution, as well as procurement 
legislation. The Gove rnmen t i s m a k i n g s ign i f ican t progress in that d i rec t ion : 
The 2004 State Budge t L a w streamlines budget execu t ion processes by c rea t ing a s ing le 
Treasury account, w h i c h a l lows im p r o v e d m o n i t o r i n g o f expenditures, I t designates the 
Treasury Depa r tmen t as the m a i n agency charged with budge t execu t ion and f inanc ia l 
management in fo rma t ion . 
The establishment o f the State Audit o f V i e t n am as an independent entity repo r t ing 
d i rec t ly t o the N a t i o n a l Assemb ly strengthens ins t i tu t iona l accoun tab i l i ty . 
The n ew A c c o u n t i n g L aw , together with n e w accoun t ing and aud i t ing standards, 
contributes t o im p r o v i n g governance. Similarly, s ign i f ican t progress in t e rm s o f 
i n f o rm a t i o n disclosure has also been made. Spec i f ica l ly , the en t i re 2005 planned and 
actual budgets, b o t h at the cen t ra l and d is t r ic t levels, we re disclosed f o r the f i r s t time, 
i n c l u d i n g aggregate amounts f o r defense expenditures. 
The ove ra l l design o f an integrated Treasury and Budget Management I n f o rm a t i o n 
System (TABMIS) i s completed. The f i r s t phase o f the T A B M I S i s expected t o become 
operational in 2009. 
The new Procurement L a w became e f fec t ive in April 2006, f o l l ow e d by the issuance in 
September 2006 o f i t s Implementing Decree. This leg is la t ion consolidated the 
fragmented 
lega l

in t roduced some 
impo r tan t 
imp rovemen ts i n c l u d i n g comp la in t hand l ing mechanisms, clearer remedies f o r violations, 
and 
f inanc ia l independence requirements 
f o r bidders. Howeve r , gaps be tween 
Vietnamese regu la t ions and in te rna t iona l best p rac t ice remain, such as the use o f d i rec t 
con t rac t ing w h e n compe t i t ion i s possible, a subjective po in ts system in the techn ica l 
eva lua t ion o f goods and works, and p r ice negotiations after compe t i t ive bidding. 
Standard bidding documents f o r the procurement o f goods we re issued in September 
2005 and standard bidding documents f o r wo rks a re cu r ren t ly under development. Since 
April 2005, with the in t roduc t ion o f a Pub l ic Procurement B u l l e t i n , bidding oppo r tun i t ies 
as well as i n f o rm a t i o n o n awards o f large contracts have been pub l ic ized . The 
Government also i s p l a n n i n g t o develop a p u b l i c procurement m o n i t o r i n g system, based 
o n the O E C D D A C guidelines. 

Using strengthened country systems. An increasing numbe r o f development assistance 
agencies - i n c l u d i n g ADB, C I D A , DANIDA, DFID, the EC , France, JB IC , SIDA, the 
Netherlands, and Spain - are p r o v i d i n g coordinated budget support th rough the W o r l d Bank - led

dialogue i s o rgan ized by p o l i c y areas in w h i c h donors engage selectively, based o n their interests 
and technical capac i ty o n the ground. These w o r k i n g groups are l e d j o i n t l y by the Government 
and various development assistance agencies. Some targeted budge t support has also been 
p rov ided by external assistance agencies. The W o r l d Bank together with Be lg ium , C I D A , DFID,
