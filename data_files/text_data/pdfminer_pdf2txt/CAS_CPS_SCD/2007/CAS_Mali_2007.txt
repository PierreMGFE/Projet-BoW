EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i . 

M a l i is a vast, semi-arid, landlocked country of 
low population density and few natural 
resources. But it does have some un- or under-tapped assets: these inc lude the N i g e r R i v e r with ve ry 

considerable po ten t ia l f o r in tens ive i r r iga ted comme rc ia l agr icu l ture ; some go ld ; and remarkab le 
cu l tu ra l and geograph ica l sites with po ten t ia l f o r h igh -end tour ism . In add i t ion , i t has an extensive 
D iaspora o f 4 m i l l i o n peop le abroad, o r one in f o u r Ma l ians , w h o r em i t extensive f i n a n c i a l f l ow s o f 
be tween $150m and $200m per year, and w h o bring contact with the ou ts ide w o r l d and the ava i lab i l i ty 
o f scarce s k i l l s . 

M a l i has opportunities to generate incomes, and a new window of opportunity is opening 

i i . 
up. T h e coun t ry has done reasonably w e l l ove r the p e r i o d o f the las t C A S : i t has a stable democracy; 
i t s econom ic g r ow t h has been decent, sound macro-econom ic management has resu l ted in econom ic 
and budge tary s tab i l i ty ; and i t has con t inued t o make gains in governance. But sectoral and s truc tura l 
re fo rms have lagged and the good per formance has n o t translated i n t o s i g n i f i c a n t l y im p r o v e d human 
deve lopmen t outcomes, in par t due t o a popu la t ion g r ow t h rate tha t i s amongst the h ighes t in the 
w o r l d . Pove r ty has dec l ined be tween 4 and 9 percentage po in ts but rema ins high. 

i i i . 

Ma l i ’s second PRSP , the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF) has 
two objectives: promotion of 
rapid and broad-based growth, and strengthening public sector 

management. I t s programs are grouped under three p i l la rs : in fras truc ture development; s truc tura l 
r e f o rm agenda and inves tmen t c l ima te ; and im p r o v e d de l ive ry o f soc ia l services. I t also inc ludes a 
governance ac t ion p lan . I t i s op t im is t ic , p r o j e c t i n g a g r ow t h rate o f 7 percent. Ach ievemen t o f this rate 
o f g r ow t h w o u l d requ i re a r a d i c a l l y new w a y t o manage the economy, but the spec i f ic actions 
necessary have n o t been fully spelled ou t in the GPRSF . 

iv. 

If M a l i wishes to have a rapid increase in incomes, it w i l l need to achieve higher per capita 
growth, which means both higher overall G D P growth and lower population pressure. Unde r 

curren t po l ic ies and mac ro management, the B a n k and the Fund w o u l d p ro jec t an average GD P g r ow t h 
o f 5.5% per year. With curren t popu la t ion g r ow t h at 3 percent per year, per cap i ta income leve ls w o u l d 
doub le in about 30 years, so M a l i w o u l d pass f r om $380 per cap i ta in 2007 t o $760 in 2035. This 
re la t ive ly modes t imp rovemen t w i l l n o t subs tan t ia l ly reduce p o v e r t y and im p r o v e the standard of 
living o f the popu la t ion . 

V . 

How might M a l i achieve transformational growth? T h e coun t ry needs t o address a number 

o f k e y constraints if i t wishes t o generate fast, b road and sustainable increase in incomes. First, i t 
w o u l d need t o accelerate access t o the r e g i o n and the r e s t o f the w o r l d . Second, i t w o u l d need t o 
deve lop basic p roduc t ive services and factors o f p roduc t ion . Third, i t w o u l d need t o deve lop new 
sources o f g row th . This w o u l d mean leve rag ing i t s assets better, no tab ly d rama t ica l ly imp rove the 
i r r i g a t i o n po ten t ia l f o r in tens ive comme rc ia l ag r icu l tu re f o r expo r t t o the r e g i o n and the rest o f the 
wo r ld ; build o n i t s ou ts tand ing cu l tu re and na tu ra l beau ty t o deve lop h igh -end tour ism ; and achieve 
better inves tmen t outcomes o f the rem i t tances and s k i l l s c om i n g f r om i t s D iaspora . Curren t ly , 
ob ta in ing better returns f r om i t s na tu ra l assets i s hampered by a number o f constraints, mos t no tab ly 
an unfriendly business and inves tmen t c l ima te , and weak s k i l l s and capacity, w h i c h find their roo ts in 
a subop t ima l governance structure. 

Donor coordination and harmonization w i l l be key to support the government achieve its 

v i . 
GPRSF key objectives. T o reduce i t s transac t ion costs, the governmen t has created a Coo rd ina t ion 
mechan ism t o ensure ha rmon iza t ion o f var ious in terven t ions . G i v e n the l im i t e d resources f o r M a l i and 
increas ing presence o f o ther partners, during the C A S p e r i o d the Bank’s in terven t ions w i l l t rans i t ion

areas where other donors are w e l l pos i t ioned t o support the GRPSF . Whe re re levan t and in 
coo rd ina t ion with other donors, the B a n k w i l l foster p rog ramma t ic approaches and budge t support. 
K e y donors w i l l also deve lop a co l labo ra t ive assistance strategy w h i c h w i l l become the founda t ions 
f o r our next CAS . 

The CAS overarching objective is to selectively assist the government in achieving its key 

vii. 
GPRSF objectives. The C A S focuses o n the f o l l ow i n g strategic ob jec t ives : (a) p r om o t i o n o f r a p i d and 
broad-based grow th ; and (b) s treng then ing p u b l i c sector management.

a v a i l a b i l i t y o f fac tors o f p roduc t ion ; and suppor t ing an ind igenous p r i v a t e sector. 
T h e second strategic ob jec t ive w i l l ensure tha t p u b l i c f i n a n c i a l management results in better 
service de l ive ry by im p r o v i n g the link be tween the budge t and sector strategies.

Given the importance of 
improved governance and capacity development, the Bank is 
selectively supporting key areas that w i l l help address the challenges to growth and development. 

A c t i v i t i e s t o support good governance w i l l focus o n the conso l ida t ion and fu r the r deepening o f the

series o f capac i ty deve lopmen t needs assessments and se lec t ive ly concen tra ted i t s in te rven t ion t o five 
key areas.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 

1. M a l i is a vast landlocked country with a relatively limited natura l resource and human capital 

base, and a highly dispersedpopulation. I t i s located in the hear t o f the Sahel, a r e g i o n threatened by 
drough t and deser t i f ica t ion . The vast m a j o r i t y o f the peop le are d i r e c t l y dependent o n their 
env ironmen ts f o r t h e i r l i v e l i h o o d s (herding, f a rm i n g o r fishing). I t i s the largest among E C O W A S 
countries by l a n d area, with a popu la t ion o f approx ima te ly 13.5 m i l l i o n , and there fore a very l o w 
popu la t ion density (1 1 persons per square k i lome ter) . ’ I t s p o p u l a t i o n i s g r ow i n g at a high annual rate 
o f 3 percent. 

2. M a l i is heir to a long historical tradition. M a l i i s loca ted around the i n - l a n d Niger R i v e r De l ta , 
cradle o f several anc ien t c iv i l iza t ions - 
the Wagadou, M a l i and Songha i empires. The r i c h o ra l 
t rad i t ion has kept a l i v e this w e a l t h o f cu l ture . This h is to ry finds express ion today in a w i d e va r ie ty o f 
cultures, languages and t rad i t ions as w e l l as m u l t i p l e h is to r ica l and c u l t u r a l sites. 

3. Ma l i ’s political structure promotes stable, democratic institutions. There i s a s trong t r a d i t i o n o f 

consensus in M a l i a n p o l i t i c s and the coun t ry i s considered one o f the mos t p o l i t i c a l l y and soc ia l ly

Since then, i t has comp le ted f o u r pres iden t ia l elections, the latest in April 2007. Mr. Amadou Touman i 
Toure was re-elected Pres iden t in the first r o u n d o f the elections, and the c o a l i t i o n tha t supported him 
w o n the leg is la t ive e lec t ions in J u l y 2007. C i v i l society has an impo r tan t p lace in the na t iona l 
dialogue, a l though the coun t ry has a h is to ry o f re la t ive ly l o w turnou ts in p o l l . 

4. Ma l i ’s adherence to market-oriented reforms and the devaluation of 
the CFA franc in 1994 
have pushed up economic growth to a sturdy 5 .7percent annua l average during 1994-2006. In the

Recen t Econom ic Deve lopments 

9 . Despite annua l variability due to repeated shocks, Ma l i ’s recent economic growth has been 

broadly favorable. B e tw e e n 2003-06, Ma l i ’s economic growth averaged 5 .3 percent per year. I t was

2.2 and 6.1 percent in 2004 and 2005, respectively). M a l i ’ s economy has performed less we l l so far in 
2007 bu t i s expected to do better in 2008. Real GDP growth i s projected to reach 4.1 percent in 2007

12. Despite Ma l i ’s recent favorable performance, its recent average economic growth was slightly 
lower than the average experienced over the last decade, although underpinned by similar factors. 

M a l i ’ s econom ic g r ow t h averaged 5.7 percent a year over the p e r i o d 2003-06. G r o w t h was d r i v e n by 
g o l d p roduc t ion ( f o r export), transpor t and commun ica t ions services, r i c e ( f o r domes t ic consumption), 
and co t ton ( f o r export). Mining code rev is ions in the ear ly 1990s unde rp inned the g o l d sector’s boom

I n agriculture, cotton sector reforms continue to be negatively affected by vested interests. I n 
addition, M a l i has not realized the potential for intensive commercial agriculture by harnessing the 

N iger R iver . , T h e establishment o f and comp l iance with an in te rna l p r i c i n g mechan ism o f co t ton 
(based o n the t r a c k i n g o f in te rna t iona l prices) has reduced the f i n a n c i a l exposure o f the Compagn ie 
M a l i e n n e p o u r 
le De'veloppement des Tex t i les (CMDT ) , 
the State-owned co t ton monopsony . 
Nevertheless, in 2007 the governmen t s t i l l needs t o recap i ta l ize C M D T by 1.4 percent o f GDP . A 
strategy, agreed amongs t stakeholders, t o split C M D T i n t o f o u r r e g i o n a l co t ton companies and then 
p r iva t ize them shou ld b e comp le ted by 2008 (box 1). 

Box 1. Cotton reform in M a l i - The issue a t hand 
I n 2001 the government undertook a comprehensive reform to enhance the sec tors competitiveness and 
performance. AAer an unsuccess fu l attempt in 2003 to privatize part o f the parastatal, CMDT, the government 
in November 2005 adopted a revised plan to res t ruc tu re the cotton sector b y 2008. Given the tough cotton 
market conditions ensuing from stagnant world cotton dollar prices and unfavorable exchange rate 
movements, advancing on these reforms i s a l l the more urgent. In addition, the cotton sector remains a crucial 
source o f income fo r a large share o f the rura l population and therefore plays a key role in poverty reduction. 
A p r ice mechanism was adopted in January 2005. The mechanism formula l i n k s the producer price to 
international market and covers three years. I t has been implemented successfully so far including an end- 
season additional payment to f a rm e r s in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 campaigns. 

- 4 - 

Despite some delays, other reform components and implementation benchmarks are broadly on track. In 
March 2006, the Council of M i n i s t e r s decided that CMDT ’s operations w i l l be divided into four balanced 
zones and privatized. The capital o f the privatized companies w i l l be shared b y private owners (61%), 
producers (20%), t h e State (17%) and ex-CMDT workers (2%). The drafting o f bidding documents and their 
adoption by t h e government and Parliament should be finalized before the end o f 2007. T h e launching o f the 
bidding process i s expected in January 2008 and the start up o f t h e privatized companies activities during the 
second semester o f 2008. 
Du r ing the 2008 transitional year, two sector issues w i l l need special attention: (a) implementing an interim 
price setting mechanism to replace the current mechanism in place; and (b) reviewing the credit system to 
ensure access to commercial bank financing o f inputs and cotton commercialization. 
Expected outcomes of 
the reforms are: (a) greater efficiency throughout the value chain; (b) substantial 
reduction o f periodic financing o f sector deficits from the government’s budget; and (c) increase in producers’ 
revenues. 
A fundamental bu i ld ing block of 
the sector reform i s the more direct involvement of organized cotton farmers 
in decisions afecting the sector. In M a y 2007, an organizational fiamework was established comprising the 
creation o f cotton producer cooperatives, from the village level to a national federation, as legal en t i t ies w i th 
statutory roles in key sector decision-making bodies, including the boards o f directors o f the new ginning 
companies. Building the capacity o f these cooperatives w i l l be critical to t h e success o f the overall reform. 
Because cotton prices are quoted in dollars, cotton producers in the CFA fvanc zone increasingly are 
confronted w i th export prices that are significantly lower in Euro/CFA f r a n c than the p r ice in dollars. This 
disparity depresses farm gate p r ices and w i l l add to the potential fiscal cost o f any scheme to stabilize farm 
prices or provide financial assistance to poor farmers . However, t h e disparity also re f lec ts t h e declining 
relative cotton prices driven by new technologies (Bt cotton) employed b y new competitors such as Brazil, 
China and India, but also b y China, EU and U S subsidies to their own production. 
Development partners, including IDA , are active in supporting capacity enhancement o f producers’ 
organizations. A fDB , AFD, USAID, the Dutch, t h e EU, and t h e Bank also are supporting a program to boost 
cotton production technology generation and transfer that covers varieties, pes t resistance, soil f e r t i l i t y , cotton 
quality, and diversification o f cropping systems. 

15 . Other state-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to pose risks to public finances and, in a 

larger sense, to growth perspectives. In the e lec t r ic i ty sector, f o l l o w i n g the f a i l e d a t temp t t o manage

The restructuring/privatization o f Banque d ’investissement du Mali ( B I M ) has reg is tered some delays.

18. While progress toward poverty reduction was acceptable, it is uneven, and spatial differences 

in poverty are widening. Na t iona l ly , inequa l i ty leve ls rema ined stable be tween 200 1 and 2006, so that 
g r ow t h does n o t appear t o have favored either the poo r o r the be t ter o f f . Depend ing o n where the 
pove r ty l i n e i s set, the decrease in p o v e r t y appears t o be e i ther p r im a r i l y u r b a n (under a high pove r ty 
l ine) o r r u r a l (under a l ow e r p o v e r t y l ine) . Howeve r , there have been im p o r t a n t d i f ferences in pove r ty 
dynam ics accord ing t o geograph ic areas. The share o f the popu la t ion in p o v e r t y f e l l substantially in 
Bamako f r om an a lready l o w base, while it rema ined ve ry high (and subs tan t ia l ly h ighe r than 
elsewhere in the coun try) in the Sikasso area. The drop in co t ton p roduce r pr ices i s the p r ima ry 
exp lana t ion why p o v e r t y leve ls f o r co t ton farmers rema in unchanged since 200 1. 

19. Despite progress i n the use of public services, spending is not pro-poor. F o r services such as 

p u b l i c p r im a r y schools, p r im a r y hea l th care, and vacc ina t ion campaigns, the l e v e l o f usage by the poor 
i s s im i la r t o that o f the p o p u l a t i o n as a who le . However , f o r a range o f o ther services, such as 
secondary and te r t ia ry schoo l ing , and hosp i ta l care, the p o o r tend t o bene f i t m u c h less than the 
popu la t ion as a w h o l e f r om p u b l i c spending. In some areas in w h i c h p u b l i c subsidies are im p l i c i t , as i s 
the case f o r e lec t r ic i ty and wa te r t a r i f f s that d o n o t enable proper cost recovery , the poo r bene f i t 10 
t imes less than the general p o p u l a t i o n f r om the ex is t ing subsidies. In add i t ion , as in other countries, 
evidence f r om p u b l i c expend i ture t r a c k i n g surveys shows tha t o n l y a m i n o r i t y o f funds allocated to 
cer ta in services in educa t ion and hea l th reach the poo r . In sum, weak ta rge t ing and leakages o f funds 
undermine the impac t o f p u b l i c spend ing on pove r ty and soc ia l ind ica tors . 

20. The economic growth has not translated into much improved social indicators. Current 
achievements w i l l not be sustainable unless the growth in per capita income accelerates. M a l i lags 

behind the r e g i o n in soc ia l ind ica to rs with m i x e d progress in im p r o v i n g soc ia l ind ica tors during the 
last CAS (table 3). S ince 2001, the inc idence o f AIDS has been reduced f r o m 1.7 per 1,000 in 2001 to 

The poverty line i s higher in method 1 (national definition used by DNSI) than in the Cost o f Basic Needs Method (method 
2) which implies higher poverty rates than method 1.

1.2 per 1,000 in 2006 . Howeve r , improvemen ts in other hea l th outcomes have been less notable. C h i l d 
m o r t a l i t y has declined, but n u t r i t i o n ind ica tors rema in stagnant, and the f e r t i l i t y rate i s one o f the 
highest in the w o r l d . P r im a r y educa t ion en ro l lmen t increased f r o m app rox ima te ly 6 1 percent in 2003

p r im a r y en ro l lmen t rate. The en ro l lmen t rate f o r girls at slightly above 50 percen t ranks b e l ow the 
SSA average. In add i t ion , the q u a l i t y o f educa t ion rema ins a concern and the l i te racy in the coun try 
(24 percent) i s one o f the lowes t in the w o r l d . 

2 1. H i g h levels of population growth also make it difficult to rapidly improve social indicators 

and have a number of other consequences. M a l i ’ s high p o p u l a t i o n g r ow t h ra te i s due t o persistently 
high rates o f f e r t i l i t y : 6.6 c h i l d r e n per woman . This rate i s comb ined with a y o u n g popu la t ion , close t o

B. MALI’S GROWTH AND STRATEGY FRAMEWORK 
FOR 2007-1 1 

2 6 . Ma l i ’s second poverty strategy, the GPRSF , provides the foundation for the government’s 
development and poverty reduction strategy for the per iod 2007-11. T h e GPRSF was prepared 

th rough in tens ive consu l ta t ions with a l l stakeholders, and submitted t o the N a t i o n a l Assembly in 
December 2 0 0 6 as a n input f o r the discussion o f the d ra f t 2007 budge t . T h e GPRSF i s designed as the 
f i r s t phase o f the 10-year ac t ion p l a n to achieve the MDGs, and i s embedded in the government’s l o n g 
t e r m v i s i o n “M a l i 2025”. 

2 7 . The GPRSF has two overarching objectives: (a) p romo te s t rong g r ow t h o f 7 percent through 
wea l th generation and emp loymen t creation; and (b) strengthen p u b l i c sector per formance through 
deepening o f ongo ing re fo rms c o v e r i n g the decen tra l iza t ion and de-concen tra t ion o f the p u b l i c sector, 
governance, econom ic and soc ia l sectors. 

2 8 . To attain its objectives of 
rapid growth and stronger public sector performance to better 
support productive sectors, the G PR S F is articulated around three strategic pillars. I t also focuses 

o n cross-cu t t ing issues tha t requ i re mu l t i -sec to r co l labora t ion . These i n c l u d e gender, te r r i to r ia l 
development, popu la t ion , and peace and security. 

P i l la r 1: Developing infrastructure and strengthening productive sectors: The ob jec t ive i s to 

imp rove p r o d u c t i v i t y o f fac tors o f p roduc t ion and econom ic g row th . This p i l l a r w i l l concentrate 
o n the fou r p r i o r i t y areas: (a) f o o d secur i ty and r u r a l development; (b) deve lopmen t o f sma l l and 
medium enterprise; (c) sustainable management o f the env i ronmen t and na tu ra l resources; and 
(d) in fras truc ture deve lopmen t . 

P i l la r 2: Consolidating the public sector structural reform agenda: This p i l l a r aims at 

strengthening e x i s t i n g s truc tura l re fo rms and the f u n c t i o n i n g o f governmen t ins t i tu t ions . Key 
focus areas are (a) conso l ida t ing p u b l i c adm in is tra t ion re fo rm , (b) r e f o rm i n g the business 
environment, (c) s treng then ing the v i a b i l i t y , reach and per formance o f the f inanc ia l sector, 
(d) p r om o t i n g governance and p u b l i c freedoms, (e) building the capac i ty o f the c i v i l society, and 
(0 strengthening r e g i o n a l and sub-reg iona l in tegra t ion . 
P i l la r 3: Strengthening the social sector: This p i l l a r focuses o n (a) crea t ing and p r om o t i n g long- 
term jobs, (b) deve lop ing access t o basic soc ia l services, and (c) c o n t r o l l i n g HIV/AIDS. 

2 9 . While the G PR S F presents a reasonable framework for the reform program, significant 
challenges must be addressed to meet its objectives. The GPRSF has set an annua l g r ow t h ob jec t ive 

o f 7 percent. I t s m a i n focus i s r a p i d and mo re d is t r ibu t ive econom ic g r ow t h f o r pove r ty reduc t ion . 
Such trans forma t iona l g r ow t h w o u l d lead t o sustained and r a p i d reduc t ion in pove r ty and 
improvemen t in soc ia l and h um a n deve lopmen t indicators. T h e GPRSF makes p r iva te sector g row th

with i t s increased emphasis o n grow th , the p roduc t ive sectors, and p u b l i c service de l ive ry . I t also

111. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES 

A. 

MEDIUM-TERM O U T L O O K AND DEBT SUSTA INAB IL ITY 

30. Ma l i ’s medium-term macroeconomic outlook appears favorable, but there are risks of 
lower 
rainfall, unfavorable terms of 
trade, and slow implementation of structural reforms. Based o n the 

latest B a n k and Fund assessments, M a l i c o u l d average 5 . 1 percen t annua l g r ow t h in the m e d i um term . 
This g r ow t h assumes b r o a d l y unchanged t e r m s o f trade, n o m a j o r extended supply shocks, and 
con t inued prudent macroeconom ic p o l i c y r e f o rm per formance (table 1). A l l key sectors-agriculture, 
mining, and services-are 
expected t o con tr ibu te t o med ium - te rm g r ow t h t o v a r y i n g degrees. High 
in te rna t iona l g o l d pr ices resu l t ing in favorab le per formance o f g o l d mining (box 2) and gran t ing debt 
r e l i e f have recen t ly strengthened the med ium - te rm ou t look . O n the p o l i c y fron t , this scenario assumes

in fras truc ture u t i l i t i e s (e lec tr ic i ty , water, and telecommunications), 
(b) im p r o v e d p r o d u c t i v i t y in 
agriculture, and (c) improvemen ts in the inves tmen t climate, i n c l u d i n g f i n a n c i a l deepening, that w o u l d 
support a d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n o f econom ic ac t iv i t ies . High g o l d pr ices bode w e l l f o r M a l i ’ s expor t earnings 
and f isca l revenues, but because o f i t s enclave nature, the g o l d sector alone i s u n l i k e l y to con tr ibu te 
s ign i f ican t ly t o p o v e r t y reduc t ion . 

Box 2. Mining in M a l i 
its indus tr ia l m in ing sector. The 
I n the past I 5 years M a l i has witnessed a s ign i jkan t development of 
liberalization o f t h e economy in t h e late 1980s resulted in the introduction o f a new m in ing law in 1991 
(supported by the WBG). Improvements in the enabling environment, w i th in i t ia l exploration programs 
funded b y the United Nations and other donors, led to a substantial in f lux o f private m in ing companies, which 
developed large scale industrial go ld mines. 
I t is important t o take measures t o sustain exploration activities, such as updating the legislation to provide for 
incentives for exploitation companies to reinvest. In addition, the sector’s contribution to the overall economic 
development can be enhanced b y improving government’s capacity for revenue collection and management 
and b y addressing some o f the negative social and environmental impacts at the community level. M a l i has a 
very large artisanal m in ing sector for which the government needs to improve health, safety, and 
environmental and social conditions. 
F ina l ly , of c r i t ica l importance for the sector is improved governance. In February 2007, M a l i joined the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). S ince then, the country has made good progress in 
implementing i t . M a l i has met 3 o f t h e 4 criteria used to assess progress and i s diligently working to achieve 
the fourth (publication o f a work program). E I T I i s an important, but not the only, element of good 
governance. The government also needs to improve m in ing t i t l e issuance and surveillance, disclosure and 
management o f geosciences information, and its oversight capabilities. The restructured m in ing component o f 
the Growth S U D D O ~ ~ Proiect w i l l address these critical issues . 

3 1. While the balance of risks is currently favorable, M a l i faces competitiveness pressure and 

potential downside risks of exogenous shocks. W h i l e M a l i has exper ienced the lowes t apprec ia t ion 
within WAEMU since the 1994 devaluation, the curren t tendency o f the Euro , t o w h i c h the C F A franc 
i s pegged at a f i x e d rate, t o appreciate re la t ive t o the U S d o l l a r i s putting pressure o n the country’s 
competitiveness, p a r t i c u l a r l y in the co t ton sector. In this context, p rese rv ing competitiveness w i l l 
require bo th a p ruden t f isca l p o l i c y t o safeguard macroeconom ic s t a b i l i t y and re fo rms to address long- 
standing s truc tura l obstacles, such as inadequate infrastructure, constraints t o d o i n g business and l o w 
p roduc t iv i ty . In add i t ion , v u l n e r a b i l i t y v is-a-v is ra in fa l l , deser t i f ica t ion , and terms o f trade shocks 
(no tab ly f luc tua t ions in the p r i c e o f cotton, g o l d and oil), are perenn ia l challenges t o M a l i ’ s economy. 
In view o f the impo r tance o f an ima l resources in M a l i ’ s economy and the curren t na t iona l capacity o n

CHALLENGES TO M A L I ’ S BROAD AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCT ION 

33 . Ma l i ’s slightly lower average growth in the recent past relative to the longer 13-year period 
underscores its challenges in sustaining growth and in raising growth to the government’s GPRSF 

target level of 7percent. Ove r the past decade, M a l i bene f i ted n o t o n l y f r om progress ive re forms but 
also f r om imp roved r a i n f a l l and the 1994 deva lua t ion . The recent g r ow t h s l ow d ow n ind ica tes tha t the

deepened and accelerated, and emphasized addressing the mos t binding cons tra in ts t o p r iva te sector

” The factors taken in to account in granting an exception to IsDB loan under the Bank’s NCBP include the urgent need for 
electricity generation capacity and potential high rate o f return on the proposed project, lack o f domestic and alternative

framework and debt sustainability.

are still limited and expensive. Desp i te recent s ign i f ican t gains,I3 as a large land- locked coun try 
M a l i ’ s transport challenges con t inue t o be enormous. M a l i i s n o t o n l y land locked ; i t also i s vast and

3 7 . M a l i needs to take further advantage of economic integration to increase its share of regional 
markets and reduce costs of exporting to the rest of 

the world. M a l i ’ s p rospe r i ty depends o n higher

Senegal, M a l i has sought to strengthen r a i l transportation, mainly by a concession w i th a private operator. In addition, the 
government created a self-financing Road Fund that initiated work on road maintenance and repair. 
I n 2003, fixed/mobile access was, 78% in Senegal and 91% i n Cote d’Ivoire. In Ma l i , the price o f international calls 
remains high and there i s s t i l l an acute need to improve services.

3 9. Despite sound macroeconomic policies and a strong regional regulatory environment, Ma l i ’s

H o u s i n g B a n k -BHM ) further con tr ibu tes t o the present s i tua t ion . R e f o rm o f these two ma jo r state 
banks has been s low . 

40. Urban areas w2ll require special attention to meet prospective growth needs. M a l i i s l e s s 

urban ized than o ther coun tr ies in the reg ion (3 1 percent in M a l i compared with the SSA average o f 36 
percent in 2006). Howeve r , the u rban areas are g r ow i n g r a p i d l y and the u rban popu la t ion i s expected 
t o doub le by 2024. T h e u rban popu la t ion already produces mo re than 50 percent o f the coun try ’s GDP . 
However , the l a c k o f roads, drainage and basic services (water, san i ta t ion and e lec t r ic i ty ) l i e s at the 
heart o f M a l i ’ s u r b a n deve lopmen t prob lems and constrains enterprise development and labor

in fras truc ture represented o n l y 6 percen t o f p u b l i c inves tmen t in recen t years. 

41, Low labor productivity resulting from low education and skill levels also is a major constraint 

to Ma l i ’s development. As the economy grows, scarc i ty o f s k i l l s i s emerg ing at the h igher end 
(secondary and post-secondary educa t ion levels), cons tra in ing d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the economy and

Box 3. Commercial agriculture - An important source o f potential growth 

Commercial irr iga ted farming is one of the major potential sources of growth in M a l i . Meanwhile, subsistence 
farming s t i l l represents 80percent of the farming systems. Mali’s agriculture sector has substantial potential to 
accelerate economic growth b y linking i t s production not only to domestic markets but, more importantly, to 
neighboring, sub-regional and international markets. The promotion o f commercial farming targeting sub 
regional and international markets i s therefore one o f t h e most promising sources o f agricultural growth. 
The C EM underlined that the factors of success of M a l i ’ s agr icu l tura l sector f a l l in to four broad areas: 
(a) control over water; (b) access to reliable markets; (c) access to quality information on improved 
technology, agricultural production systems, and regulatory environment; and (d) improved institutional and 
incentive fiamework. I t wou ld include f lex ib i l i ty to take advantage o f cropping opportunities, stronger land 
tenure and property rights, access to credit, and organized input supply and input credit mechanisms. The 
promotion o f large scale commercial farmers and agro-processors to be promoted through public-private 
partnerships arrangements i s the major challenge to overcome these constraints. 
The irr iga t ion sector offers a unique opportunity to develop commercial farming because of 
the extended 
availability of land and water. Only 19% o f the 2.2 m i l l i o n ha o f irrigation potential are actually irrigated. The 
ON, the large-scale irrigation scheme in the Niger central delta, s t i l l presen ts potential f o r development w i th 
87,000 ha currently irrigated out o f 200,000 ha planned to be irrigated before 2015. Over the go’s, ON went 
through an important reform process leading to more than double r i c e yields ( f i om 2,5 T/ha to 6 T/ha in 2006). 
L e s s expensive to create and more profitable for smallholders under r i c e cultivation, many other small-scale 
irrigation schemes deserve particular attention for fu r the r infrastructure investments: on ly 13% o f lowland 
areas and less than 3% o f rainfed small scale irrigation schemes have been developed for irrigation. The Bank 
i s supporting the government in p i lo t ing a public-private partnership financing mechanism to develop 
irrigation infiastructure and help small and large-scale commercial fa rme rs se t t le on 800 ha in ON. 
Access to quality and reliable agr icu l tura l input is another key constraint. The distribution network for 
fertilizers i s characterized b y weak professionalism, both f i om providers and producer organizations, in 
procurement. For seeds, numerous varieties have been developed b y local and regional research for different 
crops, such as the NER ICA r i c e variety and drought and disease resistant cowpea varieties that double local 
yields. Distribution networks s t i l l need to be organized and linkages between research, extension and 
producers strengthened. 
To facilitate the emergence of commercial farmers, advisory services s t i l l need to be strengthened to provide 
eflcient assistance to : (a) producers to help them meet market demands and sanitary and phyto-sanitary 
requirements; (b) producer organizations to become more professional in creating and managing a wide range 
o f marketing and technical services; and (c) private service providers to better answer producer and farmer 
associations’ needs in terms o f technology information and market in te l l igence services. Beyond r i c e and 
cotton production, horticulture and livestock a r e very promising sub-sectors for the development o f 
commercial agriculture, w i th great opportunities for producers in t e rm s o f diversification and growth. 

43, Underdeveloped potential for high-end tourism services and handicraft. M a l i has s ign i f ican t

Longer Te rm Track Record - Findings o f the Country Assistance Evaluation 

7 1. The Bank played a major role in Ma l i ’s development eflorts over the past decade, but the 
institution’s performance was uneven. During FY95-05, the p e r i o d covered by IEG’s Coun t ry 
Assistance E v a l u a t i o n (CAE), IDA ’S f inanc ing averaged $80 m i l l i o n pe r year. The Bank ’s strategy 
focused o n p o v e r t y reduc t ion th rough (a) broad-based grow th , (b) human resource development, and 
(c) p u b l i c f inance management and governance. The B a n k con t r ibu ted t o at least f o u r impor tan t 
achievements: macroeconom ic s tab i l i ty , strengthened p u b l i c f inance management, h ighe r p r im a r y 
schoo l en ro l lmen t rates, and mo re transparent and e f f i c i e n t ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk in the road sector 
lead ing t o the c rea t ion o f a r o a d maintenance fund. However , there were shor tcom ings in the Bank ’s 
strategy rega rd ing the f i n a n c i a l sector, e lec tr ic powe r and co t ton sector re forms , educa t ion qua l i ty , and 
e f fo r ts t o reduce the high rate o f popu la t ion g row th . 

72. Given the increased emphasis on social sector development, Ma l i ’s progress towards human 

resource development was disappointing. The C A E assessed tha t the B a n k had i n s u f f i c i e n t l y focused 
o n the impor tance o f qua l i ty in educa t ion and o f the impor tance o f a f f o r d a b i l i t y in hea l th care, as 
opposed to p h y s i c a l access. Some p o l i c y proposals in educa t ion (doub le-sh i f t teaching) adversely 
a f fec ted quality, and the ove ra l l l i te racy rate i s s t i l l exceed ing ly l o w . In health, f inanc ia l barriers to 
access rema in severe, and the ra te o f u t i l i z a t i o n o f hea l th services l o w . Therefore, the popu la t ion ’s 
gains in hea l th status have been modest. In addition, w h i l e the B a n k did help increase awareness o f 
f am i l y p l a n n i n g issues, the t o t a l f e r t i l i t y rate remains v e r y high. 

73 . The CA E noted that the economic and sector work (ESWJ program has been limited and had 
hampered the Bank ’s capacity to provide timely, targeted advice. While E S W e f fo r ts in tens i f ied 

during the FY99-05 per iod , there was n o comprehensive r e v i ew o f educa t ion o r hea l th until the end o f 
the per iod . In add i t ion , n o C E M was prepared during the 1990’s, weaken ing the basis f o r a clear 
g r ow t h strategy. In add i t ion , despite the s ign i f ican t gender d ispar i t ies in M a l i , the Bank ’s strategy did 
n o t bene f i t f r om a sound analysis o f gender issues. F ina l ly , the C A E no ted tha t the Bank ’s governance 
p rog ram seemed insu f f ic ien t , and the re forms supported have y ie lded l im i t e d results. 

74 . Going forward, the C A E recommends tackling s ix specific issues. They are the qua l i ty o f the 

education system, a f f o r d a b i l i t y o f hea l th services, po l ic ies t o reduce the r a p i d g r ow t h o f population, 
r u r a l deve lopmen t i n c l u d i n g conc lus ive co t ton sector r e f o rm and ag r icu l tu ra l d ivers i f ica t ion , p r o v i s i o n

challenge f o r I F C w i l l be t o p romo te g r ow t h in the n o n mining sector and t o p rov ide techn ica l 
assistance (TA) f o r r e f o rm i n g the business c l ima te t o support the p r iva te sector.

1 5 . The CA E draws two major lessons: First, given the coun try ’s capac i ty constraints, the Bank ’s 
strategy m a y have been a t temp t ing t o o m u c h at once. A mo re focused strategy i s likely t o be more 
e f fec t ive t o l a y the basis f o r long - te rm sustainable g row th . Second, m a j o r shor tcom ings occurred when 
the proposed strategy did n o t get full governmen t support ( f inanc ia l , energy and co t ton sector reforms) 
o r when the strategy was o n l y a p a r t i a l so lu t ion t o a p rob lem (educa t ion and hea l th sectors).

Findings o f the CAS Completion Report 

76. The CASCR concluded thatperformance under the last CAS was uneven. M a l i made gains in 

p u b l i c expend i ture management, 
transport, 
telecommunications, wa ter and sanitation, 
r ice 
p roduc t iv i ty , and selected soc ia l ind ica tors (AIDS inc idence and c h i l d m o r t a l i t y declined, and p r ima ry 
educa t ion en ro l lmen t increased). In add i t ion , the B a n k con t r ibu ted t o the establishment o f key 
ins t i tu t ions in agr icu l ture t o be in charge o f research and ex tens ion services, and t o m u c h imp roved 
access f r om Bamako t o the sea. Howeve r , progress has been s l ow in (a) advanc ing the co t ton reform- 
the sector s t i l l poses a f isca l risk, and p r o d u c t i v i t y i s stagnant, (b) strengthening m icro f inance , 
(c) deve lop ing f i n a n c i a l markets, and (d) fac i l i ta t ing p r iva te sector access t o f inanc ia l services. 
Coverage and q u a l i t y o f e lec tr ic i ty , and high e lec t r ic i ty costs also rema in a challenge. In addition,

and the l o w qua l i ty o f educa t ion and l o w l i te racy l e v e l rema in m a j o r concerns. 

71 . The CASCR concurs with the CA E on areas of 
focus for future WBG assistance and 
underscores s ix necessities for the new Bank strategy to address. These are to : (a) adopt a rea l is t ic 

and resu l ts-or ien ted approach; (b) im p r o v e understanding and underpinnings o f shared grow th , 
espec ia l ly in the r u r a l sector; (c) create be t ter synergies among B a n k programs t o leverage W B G

(v) a l i g n Bank ’s and government’s per formance m o n i t o r i n g systems; and (g) fu r the r develop 
coo rd ina t ion with partners and w o r k t ow a r d a l ignmen t o f operations with sector strategies and MTEFs 
by ha rmon iz ing procedures and reduc ing pa ra l le l PIUs.

Ma l i FY07 Client Survey 

1 8 . The results of 

the Client Survey (CS) highlight an overwhelming support for Bank’s 

involvement in M a l i . Stakeholders in M a l i recogn ized a s ign i f ican t r o l e f o r the B a n k in areas that they 
consider high p r i o r i t y ( f igu re 2). T h e y f e l t tha t the Bank ’s greatest va lue was l e n d i n g where others

CAS Pr inc ip les 

The C A S w i l l be gu ided by the f o l l o w i n g se t o f pr inc ip les : 

82. Selectivity. This C A S w i l l a im t o be mo re selective than in the past. The WBG in terven t ion w i l l 
target a f ew selected GPRSF themes in w h i c h it has a compara t ive advantage and can add value. I t w i l l 
meet this p r i n c i p l e g radua l ly as the government and donors are putting in p lace the basis f o r their 
coord ina ted e f f o r t t o suppor t the GPRSF. First, i t w i l l comb ine fragmen ted operations under their

125. The country’s performance-based allocation under IDA w i l l be adversely affected i f policies, 

especially governance and o ther s truc tura l r e f o rm policies, deteriorate during the C A S per iod . The 
qua l i ty o f the IDA p o r t f o l i o , p a r t i c u l a r l y with regard t o procurement, also w i l l be a key determinant o f 
the IDA a l loca t ion during the C A S per iod . 

126. I n light of 
the indicative I D A resources, the Bank w i l l rely on annua l development policy 
loans (DPL) to support the government in key structural reforms and to carry out key policy 

dialogue. Ga ins made in p u b l i c expend i ture management enable M a l i t o absorb budge tary support. 
M a l i ’ s budge t i s cred ib le and comprehensive, and sector a l loca t ions f o l l o w the GPRSF development 
p r io r i t ies . In add i t ion , the ra te o f execu t ion i s high and MTEFs in c r i t i c a l sectors are in place enabling 
the government and donors t o coord ina te w o r k th rough A c t i o n P lans upda ted year ly . To ensure 
selectivity, the p o l i c y d ia logue under the PRSC series w i l l focus o n PFM, soc ia l sectors, spec i f ic 
g r ow t h po l icy , and deve lopmen t issues that cannot be hand led in sec tora l operations, as w e l l as 
governance issues tha t hamper service de l ive ry in social sectors. In add i t ion , the PRSC series w i l l be 
the appropriate veh ic le f o r conduc t ing the g r ow t h strategy dialogue, encourag ing e labora t ion of the 
government’s g r ow t h strategy, and fac i l i ta t ing consistency be tween the sectors strategies and ac t ion 
plans and the o v e r a l l g r ow t h strategy and ac t ion p lan . 

127. Self-tanding investment operations w i l l be used selectively and M a l i w i l l continue to benefit 
from regional programs and one fully blended GEF operation. IDA w i l l focus i t s self-standing 

investment operations in the three sectors key t o de l ive r the C A S strategic ob jec t ives : energy, 
agriculture, and urban . M a l i ’ s pa r t ic ipa t ion in and share o f the proposed reg iona l pro jec ts have no t yet 
been de f ined since the p ro jec ts are at an ear ly preparation stage (append ix 9 ) . W h e n these proposed 

- 33 - 

reg iona l operations are f i rm e d up, the M a l i coun t ry team w i l l discuss the relevance o f M a l i ’ s 
pa r t ic ipa t ion in them and their comp lemen ta r i ty with the coun try ’s operations 

128. I n addition, I D A w i l l emphasize the use of SWAP-type operations. In the past, IDA has 

de l ivered assistance in coo rd ina t ion with other donors a round na t iona l strategies f o r health, education, 
and agr icu l ture . During the n e x t CAS , IDA w i l l push f o r SWAP - type operations, w h i c h w i l l pull donor 
resources i n t o single-sector suppor t funds. Imp lemen ta t ion o f this approach w i l l commence with the 
upcom ing ope ra t ion in suppor t o f ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i v i t y and S L M up sca l ing . 

C . KNOWLEDGE PROGRAM 

129. The Bank w i l l focus its knowledge program to tackle constraints to growth and service 
delivery and w i l l pay greater attention to their strategic focus and dissemination. W h i l e the latest 

c l ien t survey recogn ized know ledge and techn ica l expertise as va luab le types o f B a n k assistance, the 
C A E f o u n d n o c lear ev idence o f h o w the AAA p rog ram in f luenced lending ac t iv i t ies and supported 
the coun try ’s f o rm u l a t i o n o f sectoral po l ic ies . Therefore, the proposed know ledge p rog ram w i l l gear 
up t o enhance the unders tand ing o f u n d e r l y i n g econom ic challenges and t o strengthen the evidence- 
based p o l i c y dialogues. In add i t ion , special a t ten t ion w i l l be p a i d t o ensure better sequencing and 
d issem ina t ion o f AAA key findings. 

130. The AAA program w i l l shwt from formal reports to briefer, more targeted notes that tackle 

constraints to growth. T h e proposed know ledge p rog ram w i l l focus o n grow th , service de l ivery , and 
f iduc ia ry - re la ted challenges (table 10). F r om 2009, g r ow t h P E R notes w i l l be prepared annua l ly . The 
focus i s o n l y ind ica t ive and m a y change depend ing o n emerg ing issues re la ted t o the achievement o f 
the GPRSF. O the r themes c o u l d be comme rc ia l agriculture, reg iona l development, and State enterprise

D. MONITORING CAS AND GPRSF RESULTS 

132. The CAS results framework developed by the government and the Bank selectively supports 

the GPRSF objectives. The C A S resu l ts m a t r i x (appendix 1) ensures close a l ignmen t o f the C A S w i t h 
selected coun t ry ob jec t ives and results. T h e m a t r i x also summarizes the GPRSF ob jec t ives that the 
C A S seeks t o support, r e s u l t s tha t the WBG expects f r om i t s in terven t ions , ins trumen ts tha t the B a n k 
w i l l use t o implement i t s proposed program , and support tha t other par tners w i l l p rov ide . The results 
f ramewo rk does n o t re f lec t poss ib le acce lera t ion o f outcomes t o fully achieve the 7 percent g r ow t h 
envisaged in the GPRSF. I f add i t iona l resources become available, the results f ramewo rk w i l l be 
rev is i ted in the C A S progress repor t . 

133. CAS implementation progress w i l l be reviewed regularly with all key stakeholders. A techn ica l 

group responsible t o m o n i t o r M a l i ’ s p o r t f o l i o recen t ly was establishedU4* The group ’s two p r im a r y 
func t ions are t o (a) p romo te results-based management in a l l Bank - f inanced projects, and (b) ensure 
that r e s u l t s data f r om Bank-suppor ted pro jec ts are made ava i lab le t o the PRSP m o n i t o r i n g unit and t o 
the techn ica l m in is tr ies . This group also w i l l w o r k o n ha rmon iza t ion and a l ignmen t issues . The 
m o n t h l y “ p o r t f o l i o group” w i l l update p ro jec t ind ica tors and ensure data in teg r i ty . The quar ter ly 
p o r t f o l i o repo r t w i l l inc lude an append ix o n C A S imp lemen ta t ion and be discussed during mini- 
CPPRs. Each year, a results-based CPPR w i l l focus o n C A S r e s u l t s and execu t ion . In add i t ion , the C O 
w o r k i n g group o n H a rm o n i z a t i o n w i l l m o n i t o r Paris Dec la ra t ion ob jec t ives o n a i d effectiveness with 
support f r om the Ha rmon iza t ion unit in Wash ing ton . 

134. Increased civil society participation in the CAS monitoring process. T o respond t o feedback 

during the G A C consu l ta t ions t o strengthen c i v i l society invo lvemen t , the B a n k w i l l ac t ive ly invo lve 
the c i v i l soc ie ty in m o n i t o r i n g . This approach w i l l requ ire agreement f r om im p l em e n t i n g agencies to 
(a) produce and disclose inputs, outputs, and results f o r a l l Bank - f inanced projects, (b) contract with 
NGOs /academ ic ins t i tu t ions t o m o n i t o r grassroots inputs and outputs against targets, and (c) disclose 
and w i d e l y disseminate i n f o rm a t i o n and progress o n pro jec ts . 

13 5 . Various initiatives w i l l strengthen capacity to create demand for data and produce data for 

results monitoring. M a l i ’ s ongo ing weakness and tardiness in p roduc ing n a t i o n a l statistics makes 
t rack ing results d i f f i c u l t , whe ther f o r the GPRSF, MDGs, o r CAS . T h e B a n k i s w o r k i n g with UNDP, 
UN ICEF , DN S I , and the GPRSF m o n i t o r i n g unit t o establish a GPRSF m o n i t o r i n g system tha t uses an

partners in this i n i t i a t i v e also have comm i t ted substantial f inanc ia l and techn ica l resources. 

136. The Bank w i l l mobilize partners to fund the government’s Na t iona l Strategy for Development

137. The political environment represents a limited risk to the program. M a l i i s l i k e l y t o ma in ta in 

i t s stable p o l i t i c a l arrangements based o n democratic r u l e and extended c i v i l soc ie ty ac t iv i ty . L o c a l

decentralizing. T h e WBG j o i n t l y with other donors w i l l support this e f f o r t . 

13 8 . In te rna l vested interests may slow reforms and prevent removing critical constraints to 

economic growth and service delivery. In the past, delays and setbacks in the s truc tura l r e f o rm agenda 
con tr ibu ted t o lower- than-expec ted econom ic performance. M a l i ’ s sustained accelerated g r ow t h w i l l 
no t be reached i f the inves tmen t c l ima te i s n o t imp roved by r em o v i n g c r i t i c a l constraints. Does the 
p o l i t i c a l economy p r o v i d e the basis f o r the government t o undertake such far-reach ing and u l t im a t e l y 
d isrup t ive re forms? M o v i n g f r o m a G D P g r ow t h rate o f 5.1 percent t o 7 percent, accompanied by an 
i n f l e c t i o n o f the demograph ic trend line, w o u l d t rans fo rm M a l i and accelerate the sustainable 
reduc t ion o f pove r ty . Howeve r , the re fo rms requ ired w o u l d be d i f f i c u l t and p o l i t i c a l l y sensitive. The 
Bank w i l l assist the governmen t in the timely imp lemen ta t ion o f i t s ac t ion p l a n f o r s truc tura l r e f o rm 
be ing developed under the GPRSF. I t i s impo r tan t f o r the B a n k t o engage the n ew government in 
dialogue o n the cha l leng ing t im e l y imp lemen ta t ion o f the agenda r e f o rm . 

139. On the sectoral level, c r i t i c a l re fo rms in energy, cotton, and serv ice d e l i v e r y requ ire addressing 
several ins t i tu t iona l cons tra in ts tha t have prevented progress in the past. T h e government has 
comm i t ted t o under take measures tha t depart f r om i t s prev ious p o l i c y stance. F o r instance, in energy, 
the government has i n i t i a t e d interconnectedness with ne ighbo r ing coun tr ies and i s b r i n g i n g in p r iva te 
generators 
t o comp lemen t 
the State enterprise. 
In service de l ivery , 
too, 
the emphasis on 
decen tra l iza t ion signals a departure f r om the past. F o r cotton, g i v e n the m u l t i p l i c i t y o f players, the 
pa th i s less uncer ta in . To assist these processes, the C A S w i l l assist the governmen t through greater 
emphasis o n unders tand ing and dea l ing with the p o l i t i c a l economy uncer ta in t ies and in engaging in 
pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships. 

140. Another risk is that donor coordination w i l l not work as well as expected and thus w i l l lead to 

uncertain and decreasing assistanceflows. At present, donors have a great degree o f comm i tmen t t o 
harmon ize the i r approach. T h e C A S w i l l con tr ibu te t o the basic in fras truc ture o f cooperation. 
However , the C A S takes a cau t ious stance regard ing increases in ex terna l f inanc ing f lows , i n c l u d i n g 
mechanisms t o ensure p r e d i c t a b i l i t y o f aid. At the t im e o f the progress report, the B a n k w i l l take stock 
o f the progress made in dono r ha rmon iza t ion and in troduce any necessary mod i f ica t ions . 

14 1. Regionally, political developments pose additional but limited risks. As a land locked country, 

M a l i i s highly exposed t o the p o l i t i c a l uncertainties o f i t s ne ighbors . During the c o n f l i c t in CGte 
d ’ lvo ire , M a l i strengthened a l terna t ive trade routes. The exper ience also strengthened M a l i ’ s 
preparedness f o r fu tu re such r i s k s . To m i n im i z e the risk o f future d isrup t ions , the B a n k i s suppor t ing 
government t o increase the m e n u o f ava i lab le trade routes. 

- 3 6 - 

142. F ina l ly , M a l i remains vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices (gold, cotton, and o i l ) . A 

f a l l in in te rna t iona l g o l d pr ices w o u l d have a drastic impac t o n M a l i ’ s econom ic grow th , w h i c h over 
the last decade has been d r i v e n la rge ly by this sector. Because co t ton i s i t s m a i n export, f luc tua t ions in

Da te o f C A S : Ju ly 30 ,2003 
Pe r iod covered by C A S : J u l y 2003 - June 2007 (FY04-07) 
C A S C om p l e t i o n Repo r t prepared by: A l em a S idd iky , (Consultant) 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) evaluates the effectiveness o f IDA ’S FY04-06 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ma l i ’ in achieving its intended outcomes and draws 
lessons to guide the design of the new country strategy f o r FYOS-11. T h e repo r t rev iews the Bank ’s 
strategic objectives, p rog ram o f suppor t and their relevance t o the government’s deve lopmen t goals. 
The repo r t also assesses t o wha t ex ten t the B a n k was successful in mee t ing these ob jec t ives and 
presen ts a set o f lessons f o r fu tu re B a n k assistance. 

2. 
T h e repo r t i s based o n reference documents’ and discussions with the coun t ry team, 
governmen t counterparts and var ious stakeholders. The assessment has bene f i ted f r om a recent 
eva lua t ion o f the Bank ’s per formance in M a l i over the p e r i o d 1995-2005 by the Independent 
Eva lua t ion G roup (IEG). IEG consu l ted the Bank ’s team during the prepara t ion o f the i r repor t . 

3 . 

The CASCR assesses CAS implementation from the perspective o f the Bank’s new 
results framework. G i v e n tha t the t ime f rame dates back t o 2003 w h e n the Bank ’s focus o n manag ing 
f o r r e s u l t s was n o t articulated, the C A S did n o t e x p l i c i t l y i d e n t i f y core measurable results. I t o n l y 
stated k e y deve lopmen t outcomes with n o clear baseline and targets (Annex 9 ) . Mo reove r , the C A S 
concentrated o n inputs and processes ra ther than o n outcomes. Thus, s ign i f ican t ly , this C A S C R had t o 
r e t r o f i t the in tended ob jec t ives f r om a broader perspective 

4. 
An important conclusion o f the present evaluation i s that overall performance under the 
FY04-06 CAS i s rated as moderately satisfactory. Progress t ow a r d mos t o f the sectors during the 
C A S p e r i o d has been uneven . E v e n though the coun try ma in ta ined an average g r ow t h rate o f 5% and 
pove r ty dec l ined moderately, b o t h were uneven. As a result, the g r ow t h did n o t translate i n t o ove ra l l 
pove r ty reduc t ion in r u r a l areas due t o p o o r service de l ive ry . The B a n k was modera te ly successful in 
assisting the governmen t t o strengthen p u b l i c finance management, create a road maintenance fund,

Macroeconomic Stability & Growth 
Despite the adverse shock during 2004 , Ma l i ’s overall macroeconomic performance in 
the last few years has been respectable. I n i t i a l l y , in 2004, the locus t invas ion , drought, commod i ty

especially in customs duties. O n the p o l i c y side, in the face o f d i f f i c u l t econom ic circumstances, M a l i

Transport 
14. 
T h e Bank ’s assistance focused o n transport in fras truc ture and services in the areas o f urban 
and r u r a l roads and r a i lw a y th rough two m a i n pro jec ts : Transpor t Co r r ido r and Investment Pro jec t 
(FY04) and Ru ra l Infrastructure P ro jec t (FYOO). These pro jec ts concentrated o n p u b l i d p r i v a t e 
inves tmen t and v i a b i l i t y in transport infrastructure, maintenance o f transpor t in fras truc ture assets and

th rough Econom ic Po l icy and Pub l ic F inance Management C red i t (FY06) and the PRSC-1 (FY07). 

15. 
Progress in the transpor t sector was uneven. Ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms were under taken t o make the 
road sector mo re e f fec t ive and transparent. However , the high cost o f transport put pressure o n poor 
management and maintenance in the transport in fras truc ture . The transport sector i s considered the

In the road sector, r o a d maintenance im p r o v e d and the n e w imp lemen ta t ion agency set up in 
2005 i s opera t iona l . T h e budge t a l loca t ion f o r road maintenance was increased and the co l lec t ion f o r

F C F A 994 m i l l i o n t o F C F A 7 .522 b i l l i o n . A r u r a l roads strategy was prepared, and imp lemen ta t ion 
has been in i t ia ted o n a p i l o t basis. Since then, o n l y 25% o f the r u r a l r o a d maintenance w o r k has been 
comp le ted in 2006 o u t o f a 2007 target o f f 40%. M o r e urban roads (122.6 km) were reconstructed, 
rather than rehabilitated, under the Bank-suppor ted Urban Development and Decentralization Project 
(FY97) because existing roads were in an advanced stage o f degradation. 

17. 
T h e B a n k also he lped strengthen p u b l i c and p r iva te sector capac i ty t o imp lemen t a new 
demand-dr iven de l ive ry strategy f o r i r r i g a t i o n and drinking wa ter in fras truc ture . The strategy 
enhanced the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f bene f ic iar ies in the design, management, and maintenance o f the

18. 
Progress in the ra i lway concession was d isappo in t ing . T h e r a i lw a y inves tmen t p l a n was no t 
executed, and the arrears paymen ts by r a i l users in Senegal d i d n o t make any progress. F r om the 
Bank ’s perspective, execu t ing some o f the p o l i c y re fo rms had comp l ica t ions , i n c l u d i n g d i f f icu l t ies in 
f inanc ia l resources o f Transra i l . The cumu la t ive length o f the s l ow d ow n increased due t o the delayed 
execu t ion o f the inves tmen t p l a n t o rehab i l i ta te track and t o increase the a v a i l a b i l i t y o f engines o f 
wagons. These factors s i g n i f i c a n t l y increased derailments. 

19. 
T h e B a n k also p r o v i d e d assistance in im p r o v i n g the regu la to ry env i ronmen t o f the transport 
sector. Ins t i tu t iona l measures opera t iona l ized the customs i n f o rm a t i o n systems and extended them to 
the customs o f f i c e at the B am a k o r a i l station. Under PRSC-1 (FY07), k e y p o l i c y measures were taken 
that inc luded l ow e r i n g the transpor t opera t ing costs, faster customs clearance o f shipments, w h i c h 
released trucks, and e l im i n a t i o n o f ex tra- lega l fees co l lec ted a t r o a d b locks , thus increas ing the 
p r o f i t a b i l i t y o f t ruck ing . T h e Bank ’s CEM (FY07) and Transport Support to Sustainable Growth 
(FYO4) reports p r o v i d e d recommenda t ions o n transport and trade f a c i l i t a t i o n t o strengthen ex is t ing 
re forms and the fu tu re r e f o rm p rog ram . Overa l l , M a l i ’ s transport strategy needs t o ensure adequate 
f inanc ia l and human resources t o m a i n t a i n in fras truc ture and t o increase e f f i c i e n c y by implementing 
sound f isca l po l ic ies and suppo r t ing cross-sectoral in i t ia t ives in competitiveness, r o a d safety, r u r a l 
pover ty , H I V / A I D S preven t ion , and hea l th service access ib i l i ty . M o s t o f these recommendations w i l l 
be imp lemen ted in the n e x t transpor t project, w h i c h w i l l be a l igned with the n e x t CAS. 

20. 
Remed ia l measures need t o be taken in future B a n k operations t o achieve results, no tab ly the 
res truc tur ing o f the r a i lw a y componen t in the ongo ing transport pro jec t . The B a n k teams need t o w o r k

transport strategy needs t o i n v o l v e sectors that have an interest in the se lec t ion transpor t investments. 
F o r example, t o take i n t o account i t s sector’s needs, the agr icu l ture team needs t o be engaged in the

increased f r om 56.6% in 1999-2000 t o 75% in 2005-06. Girls’ gross en ro l lmen t increased t o 52%

28% o f n o n salary budge t were decentralized. Mode ra te progress was made in supplying and

78. 
The cho ice o f ins trumen ts during the C A S p e r i o d was adequate in m o s t sectors. However , the 
Bank ’s ove ra l l approach was n o t consistent. F o r example, in the ru ra l lag r icu l tu re sector, a ve ry 
t rad i t iona l p ro jec t approach was used; and, a l though the p o r t f o l i o was aligned, there were s t i l l too 
many operations in the same sectors. The Bank ’s fu tu re lend ing needs t o b e m o r e consistent with i t s 
n ew results f ramewo rk . 

79. 
Due t o the government’s weak ins t i tu t iona l capacity and p o l i t i c a l d i f f i c u l t i e s in implementing 
s truc tura l re forms in the agreed per iod , there were considerable delays in implementing re forms in the

During the C A S period, several pieces o f ana ly t ic w o r k (pove r ty assessment, HNP coun try

nII. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

A. Lessons Learned 

The f o l l ow i n g lessons have been d r aw n f r om the sector assessment 

9 0 . Ambitious targets. The C A S supported a p rog ram tha t posed s ign i f ican t challenges. Given the size 
o f the program, mos t o f the targets se t were ex treme ly amb i t ious . Some targets under different 
objectives were taken d i r e c t l y f r o m the government’s PRSF targets, w h i c h are v e r y b road and d i f f i c u l t 
t o in f luence and t o achieve during the C A S per iod . F o r example, PRSF’s targe t date t o reduce pover ty 
( 2 0 0 6 ) was mo re amb i t ious than the MDG target date (20 15). 

91 . 

Not a results-based CAS. The C A S was no t r e s u l t s focused and h a d n o instruments f o r 
m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion . Some per formance ind ica tors lacked base l ine data; therefore, it was very 
d i f f i c u l t t o m o n i t o r and measure progress made during the C A S pe r iod . PRSF progress reports and 
Jo in t S t a f f Assessments (JSAN ) were prepared; however, n o progress o n C A S benchmarks was 
mon i to red o r reported. 

92 . Lack of synergy among operations. Some projects had mu l t i -sec to r components, bu t the Bank ’s 
sector s ta f f w o r k e d la rge ly independen t ly . There was l a c k o f coo rd ina t ion o f j o i n t missions and 
meetings t o achieve se t targets. L a c k o f coo rd ina t ion was due t o i n s u f f i c i e n t incen t ives and leverage to 
w o r k in cross-sectoral teams. F o r example, b o t h the r u r a l deve lopmen t and transport sectors had a 
r u r a l in fras truc ture componen t in their pro jec ts . 

B. Recommendations 
The Bank needs to adopt a realistic and results-oriented approach. The C A S did n o t have 
9 3 . 
a clear agenda f o r suppo r t ing the government’s PRSF, w h i c h h a d broader objectives. The Bank ’s 
future strategy shou ld focus o n results tha t are feasible based o n the coun try ’s c o n d i t i o n and IDA 
resources. The Bank‘s p r o g r am needs t o become mo re e f fec t ive and m o r e focused th rough selectivity, 
consolidated inves tmen t operations, pursuit o f program-based approaches, better a l ignmen t w i t h 
coun try po l ic ies and ins t i tu t ions , and stronger co l labo ra t ion with governmen t and other donors o n 
ESW. The C A S outcomes need t o be responsive t o the c l ien t ’s capac i ty and ins t i tu t iona l and p o l i t i c a l 
contexts. 

9 4 . 

Synergies need to be created among the Bank’s sector programs and within the Wor ld 
Bank Group, Even t h o u g h m a n y o f the Bank ’s ob jec t ives in the FY04-06 C A S were multi sectoral 
and cross-cutting, sector s t a f f w o r k e d within silos. One excep t ion i s the synergies w h i c h have 
developed be tween the PRSC p rog ram and spec i f ic TA and some inves tmen t lend ing operations. 
However , be tween sector ac t iv i t ies , there was ve ry l i t t l e synergy. F u r t h e r s treng then ing i s essential. 
There i s a need t o create strategic links among the Bank ’s instruments, pa r t icu la r ly among the sector 
operations. IDA also needs t o w o r k mo re c lose ly with I F C and MIGA t o p romo te p r iva te sector 
growth, and with WB I t o build capac i ty . 

- 66 - 

9 5 . 

T o create optimal results, the analytical wo rk needs to sequence better with lending 
operations (investment and programmatic) and policy dialogue. The n e w C A S needs t o a l i g n well 
with disseminated ana ly t ica l w o r k and p o l i c y d ia logue needs t o suppor t a we l l -de f ined CAS program . 
A n a l y t i c w o r k c o u l d be launched j o i n t l y with GoM, research ins t i tu t ions in the country, and 
deve lopmen t partners. Thus, the Bank ’s ana ly t ica l w o r k can be enhanced by c o n t i n u i n g t o strengthen 
outreach and d issem ina t ion . 

96 . 

Create a CAS performance monitoring system and align w i th Government’s GPRSF 
monitoring system. T h e C A S did n o t have a r e s u l t s f ramewo rk tha t c o u l d be m o n i t o r e d t o take timely 
correc t ive actions and ensure resu l ts o n the ground. T h e fu tu re C A S needs t o select a l im i t e d number 
o f core m e d i um - t e rm outcomes suppo r t ing the government’s GPRSF and the Bank ’s proposed lend ing 
and AAA w o r k . T h e B a n k must put in place a m o n i t o r i n g system tha t enables the government and 
deve lopmen t partners t o j o i n t l y m o n i t o r progress o n the program . 

9 7 . 

The Bank needs to continue to work closely w ith development partners in fostering the 
harmonization and alignment agenda. T h e B a n k shou ld in troduce the n o rm tha t ana ly t ica l w o r k i s 
p lanned and done j o i n t l y with na t iona l actors and other deve lopmen t par tners in the sector and tha t the 
results are shared with the widest poss ib le range o f stakeholders. Compara t ive advantage and 
se lec t iv i ty have become key c r i te r ia f o r the Bank ’s business mode l . Thus, the B a n k shou ld foster 
co l labora t ive assistance strategies, b o t h at the coun t ry l e v e l and in the sectors, w h i c h w i l l be impor tan t 
too ls f o r the d i v i s i o n o f labo r among the deve lopmen t partners. 

9 8 . 

Understanding o f the underpinnings o f shared growth must be improved, espec ia l ly in 
the r u r a l sector. The C A S did n o t address enough key i s s u e s tha t hamper ag r icu l tu ra l g row th . A clear 
strategy in this sector i s impera t ive .

APPENDIX 4: TRENDS IN POVERTY 

1. 
This append ix analyzes p o v e r t y trends in M a l i f r om 200 1 t o 2006 . This p e r i o d was marked by 
good g r ow t h performance, in pa r t l i n k e d t o large p r iva te and p u b l i c inves tmen t f l ow s as well as an 
increase in exports ( g o l d and cotton). In 2002, the rea l GD P g r ow t h ra te reached 4.4 percent. In 2003, 
thanks t o a reco rd crop year, g r ow t h soared t o 7.7 percent. The year 2004 was m a r k e d by an invas ion 
o f locusts and l o w r a i n f a l l , caus ing a f a l l in g r ow t h t o 2.8 percent and a large f o o d de f ic i t , as w e l l as 
i n f l a t i o n in the f o l l o w i n g year. Recen t ly , the economy has suffered f r o m f luc tua t ions in the p r ice o f 
o i l , unstable prices f o r the m a i n expo r t products and the con t inu ing c r is is in CBte d ’ Ivo i re . These 
factors con t r ibu ted t o a g r ow t h es t ima ted at 5.3 percent f o r 2006 compared t o 6 .1 percen t in 2005. In 
total, t a k i n g i n t o account an es t ima ted popu la t ion g r ow t h rate o f abou t 2.5 percen t pe r year f o r the 
pe r iod 2001-2006, the M a l i a n economy witnessed an aggregate cumu la t ive G D P g r ow t h rate per 
capita o f 12.4 percent be tween 2001 and 2006. W e can there fore expect p o v e r t y to have fa l len 
s ign i f ican t ly . 

2. 
T w o methods were used t o ca lcu la te the pove r ty thresholds. T h e f i r s t m e t h o d was based o n 
prev ious w o r k by the D N S I using the E M E P with the pove r ty thresho ld de term ined using the ca lor ic 
energy method. This me thod gave a p o v e r t y thresho ld o f 144,022 C F A F per person per year in 
2001/02 and a pove r ty headcoun t o f 68.3 percent (share o f the poo r in the t o t a l popu la t ion) . In light o f 
the evo lu t ion o f the cost o f living (accord ing t o data f o r the consumer p r i c e index), the comparable 
pove r ty thresho ld was 157,920 C F A F pe r person per year in 2006. Estimations based on the E L I M 
suggest a fa l l in the share of 
the p o o r popu la t ion to 64.4 percent acco rd ing t o this f i r s t method for

e t de I’Informatique (DNSI): the EMEP 2001/02 (“enqubte malienne pour l’dvaluation de la pauvret6”) and the 
E L I M 2006 (“enqubte legere intdgrke auprks des mdnages”). These two surveys d i f fer somewhat from one 
another, but the data are sufficiently comparable to enable us to analyse the poverty trends.

per year in Bamako) and i t va r ied acco rd ing t o the geographic l o c a t i o n o f the households. According 
to this new poverty l ine , the headcount of poverty f e l l more s ign i f ican t ly between 2001 and 2006. 
While 55.6 percent of Ma l ians had been l iv ing below this a l terna t ive poverty threshold in 2001, the 
headcount f e l l to 47Spe rcen t by 2006. S t i l l , even w i th these alternative estimates, the number ofpoor 
people continued t o r ise over time due to popu la t ion grow th . Spec i f ica l ly , the numbe r o f poo r peop le 
rose f r om 5,687 m i l l i o n in 2001 t o 5,841 m i l l i o n in 2006.

Although the na t iona l poverty trend wou ld seem to be reasonable and heading in the r igh t 
direction, we are less conJident w i t h rega rd to poverty trends among sub-groups of 
the population, in 
pa r t icu la r w i th respect to the p lace of residence. The results ob ta ined using the t w o d i f fe ren t methods 
d i f f e r in some cases. T h e f i r s t m e t h o d suggests tha t pove r ty has f a l l e n m o s t l y in u rban areas, whereas 
the second me thod suggests a f a l l p r im a r i l y in r u r a l areas. With rega rd t o regions, the f a l l in pove r ty o f 
between 15 and 2 0 percentage p o i n t s recorded in the K a y e s -K o u l i k o r o reg ions seems t o be ve ry high. 
Generally, a f a l l o f this magn i tude i s observed when a reg iona l economy exper ienced fundamental 
changes and recorded v e r y high g r ow t h levels, w h i c h i s n o t the case in M a l i . T h e f a l l in pove r ty i s just 
as s ign i f ican t in Bamako , whereas in Mop t i lSegou , Tombouc tou /Gao /K ida l and Sikasso, it i s m u c h 
l ow e r o r even nega t ive depend ing o n the type o f measurement used. Mo re generally, the fact that 
certain poverty trends concerning the region or area of 
residence (urban or r u r a l ) depend on the 
the popu la t ion lives close to the poverty threshold. This 
method used indicates that a large p a r t of 
conc lus ion suggests that, even i f the pove r ty inc idence has fa l len , the households tha t have become 
n o n p o o r p robab ly are s t i l l highly vu lnerab le t o econom ic f luc tua t ions in their sectors o f ac t iv i ty o r 
area o f residence.

The evolution of 
the incidence of poverty according to regions and household occupations can 
be linked to GDP trends per sector. The case o f agr icu l ture i s p a r t i c u l a r l y impo r tan t as the m a j o r i t y o f 
the popu la t ion s t i l l depends o n this sector o f ac t iv i ty . In 2005, the p r im a r y sector recorded a g r ow t h in 
vo lume o f 5.1 percent. F o o d c rop p roduc t ion to ta l led 3,367,200 tonnes (m i l le t , sorghum, paddy r ice 
and corn), represen t ing an increase o f 18.4 percent in 2005-06 versus the p rev ious year. These good 
resu l ts can be exp la ined by favorab le c l ima t ic conditions, government’s an t i- locus t measures, 
imp lemen ta t ion o f i r r i g a t i o n projects, and d is t r ibu t ion o f im p r o v e d var ie t ies o f r i c e and corn. 
A c c o r d i n g t o the cost o f basic needs approach (me thod 2), these good results seem t o have lowe red 
pove r ty in r u r a l areas. The excep t ion i s the poorer per formance o f the co t ton sector, as no ted by high 
rates o f pove r ty in the Sikasso area. Probab ly due in par t t o l ow e r pr ices p a i d t o producers, co t ton 
p roduc t ion f e l l f r o m 585,014 tonnes in 2004 t o 534,000 tonnes and 410,370 tonnes in 2005 and 2006, 
respec t ive ly . These are dec l ines o f 8.7 percent and 23 .1 percent, respec t ive ly . Co t ton ’s lowe r producer 
p r ice helps exp la in the absence o f a f a l l in pove r ty in the Sikasso reg ion . 

6. 
Generally, the g row th recorded in Mali in recent years has led to a fall in poverty, and has 
been more or less neu tra l w i t h regard to inequality trends. The consump t ion g r ow t h rate o f the poor 
popu la t ion has been s im i l a r t o tha t o f wea l th ier people. With regard t o future reduc t ion in pover ty , the 
B a n k has prepared f o u r scenarios, each based o n a hypo the t ica l G D P per cap i ta g r ow t h rate. The 
u n d e r l y i n g assump t ion i s tha t g r ow t h in GDP per capita w i l l be m o r e o r l e s s re f lec ted d i rec t ly in 
chang ing leve ls o f househo ld consump t ion but w i l l n o t change inequa l i ty . A g r ow t h rate in GD P per 
capita o f 3 percent i s slightly above the rate observed in the coun t ry over the past 5 years. Under such 
a g r ow t h rate, the p o v e r t y headcount w o u l d be approx ima te ly 3 7 percen t in 2015 (based o n a rate of 
47.5 percen t in 2006) ( tab le 4.1). In contrast, a per cap i ta g r ow t h ra te o f 4 percen t w o u l d l ow e r the 
pove r ty inc idence t o app rox ima te ly 30 percent in 2015. Nevertheless, WB must rema in prudent in 
using such s imu la t ions . F o r example, due m a i n l y t o l o w w o r l d co t ton prices, the co t ton sector i s 
exper ienc ing d i f f i c u l t i e s tha t m a y s l ow pove r ty reduc t ion . In add i t ion , the coun t ry i s s t i l l dependent o n 
a range o f exogenous factors, i n c l u d i n g unforeseen c l im a t i c events, w h i c h can cause a f a l l in g r ow t h

APPENDIX 6: MAL I AND AID HARMON IZAT ION 

What i s the context? 

1. 
M a l i s igned the Paris Dec la ra t ion in 2005. Recently, the governmen t has taken several 
measures to m o v e the Par is agenda fo rwa rd . A Ha rmon iza t ion Secretariat has been established in the 
Ministry o f Finance, and a H a rm o n i z a t i o n and A l i g nm e n t A c t i o n P l a n has been developed with the

management has taken up the challenge, m a k i n g ha rmon iza t ion and a l ignmen t a special p r i o r i t y in the 
CAS . A H a rm o n i z a t i o n and Alignment unit also has been created in the Bank ’s M a l i o f f ice . 
I n t e n s i f y i n g ha rmon iza t ion e f fo r ts also i s in l i n e with FY03-06 C A S C R recommendations. 

How does the CAS intend to respond to the Paris agenda? 

2. 
The Paris agenda i s summarized in 5 chapters: ownership, a l ignmen t , harmon iza t ion , 
management f o r resu l ts , and m u t u a l accoun tab i l i ty . The C A S addresses these chapters in m u l t i p l e 
ways. Ownership i s s t imu la ted by h e l p i n g the governmen t th rough ana ly t ic studies and TA t o imp rove 
the pove r ty reduc t ion strategy and resource a l loca t ion mechanisms, deve lop sector strategies and 
medium-term expend i ture frameworks , and build m o n i t o r i n g and s ta t is t ica l capac i ty . The B a n k also 
w i l l support the n e w l y created Ha rmon iza t ion Secretariat, but the exact t e r m s are n o t y e t defined. 

3 . 

The C A S i s fully a l igned with the p r io r i t ies set in the GPRSF, w h i c h i s supported by the 
Bank ’s PRSC. E f f o r t s are under taken t o harmon ize the c o n d i t i o n a l i t y f ramewo rk with the ind ica tors 
developed by the governmen t . In the water and san i ta t ion and educa t ion sectors, the sector strategies 
as a w h o l e are suppor ted by program-based mechanisms. The B a n k u s e s the PRSC t o con tr ibu te t o the 
wa ter and san i ta t ion and hea l th sector strategies. The educa t ion sector strategy i s s t i l l supported by a 
pa ra l le l operation, t o b e merged i n t o the PRSC f r om the n e x t phase. F o r ag r icu l tu re and S LM , the 
B a n k supports G o M t o deve lop the sector strategy and t o establish a pub l ic -p r iva te sector-wide 
inves tmen t fund. During this C A S period, the Bank ’s agr icu l ture operations g radua l ly w i l l move f r om

(FY09), support t o ag r icu l tu ra l re fo rms w i l l be merged with the PRSC . The transport sector has t r ied 
t o limit the number o f pa ra l le l P IU s by es tab l ish ing one P I U f o r a l l operations. 

4. 
The C A S re f lec ts the Bank ’s in ten t ions t o step up i t s e f fo r ts t o harmonize i t s operations with 
those o f the other deve lopmen t partners and t o be mo re selective by focus ing o n fewe r sectors. These 
in ten t ions have been prepared in discussions with governmen t and other donors w h i l e l o o k i n g at the 
Bank ’s compara t ive advantage. An impo r tan t dec is ion has been made by the deve lopmen t partners to 
prepare a co l labo ra t ive CAS , w h i c h c o u l d be put in place at the end o f this C A S per iod . A staff 
member o f the M a l i o f f ice , seconded by the Dan ish government f o r the Par is agenda, w i l l have a key

exercises t o be t ter d i v i d e the deve lopmen t partners’ support, spreading i t over a l l re levan t GPRSF 
sectors based o n the compara t ive advantages o f each donor .

7. 

As the Bank ’s operations are v e r y m u c h a l igned with governmen t ’s pr ior i t ies , mutual 
accoun tab i l i ty i s genera l ly a c r u c i a l guiding p r i n c i p l e f o r the w a y the B a n k operates. In the sectors 
with SWAPS, j o i n t operations, and whose operations’ r e s u l t s and c o n d i t i o n a l i t y frameworks are very 
m u c h grounded in the government’s results frameworks, cond i t ions have been created t o reach fully 
m u t u a l accoun tab i l i ty . 

Wha t are the challenges fo r this CAS-period? 

8 . 

The Bank ’s b igges t challenge in pa r t icu la r f o r the agriculture, transport, energy, and f inanc ia l 
sectors, i s t o strengthen the capac i ty o f permanent coun t ry ins t i tu t ions and the coun try ’s f inanc ia l

T h e imp lemen ta t ion o f M a l i ’ s deve lopmen t p rog ram i s a f fec ted by capac i ty weaknesses that 
genera l ly relate to : (a) p o o r u t i l i z a t i o n o f the ins t i tu t iona l and o rgan iza t iona l arrangements tha t have 
been adopted t o fac i l i ta te and ca r ry ou t deve lopmen t action; (b) weak imp lemen ta t ion cu l ture 
exacerbated by the discrepancy be tween the i n f o rm a l behav ior o f governmen t actors and f o rm a l rules; 
(c) l a c k o f incen t ives t o t r igge r the necessary behav ior change; (iv) l a c k o f c l a r i t y o f the mandates and 
ro les o f k e y deve lopmen t actors, p a r t i c u l a r l y p u b l i c agencies in t rans i t ion and c i v i l society; and 
(v) acute shortage o f t ra ined and exper ienced personnel. In the past f e w years, the governmen t o f M a l i 
has taken a series o f measures t o address capacity weaknesses in the adm in is tra t ion . A p o l i c y 
documen t (PD I , P rog ram f o r I n s t i t u t i o n a l Deve lopmen t) has been adopted, and a h igh - leve l 
governmen t body, the Comm issa r ia t f o r I n s t i t u t i o n a l Deve lopmen t (CD I ) and a N a t i o n a l Comm i t tee 
f o r Capac i ty Building have been established t o coord ina te P D I imp lemen ta t ion . Howeve r , the 
government’s p rog ram i s h a v i n g l i t t l e impac t so far. 

Concentrating on implementation 

2. 

The governmen t rea l izes tha t i t must n o w concentrate i t s e f fo r ts o n the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
ex is t ing p o l i c y and regu la to ry f ramewo rks and re f ra in f r om es tab l ish ing n e w ones. T h e absence o f 
p o l i c y and regu la to ry f ramewo rks i s n o t the p r o b l em in M a l i . In fact, there i s clear evidence that the 
coun try ’s a b i l i t y t o generate f o rm a l ins t i tu t ions w i t h o u t concom i tan t c omm i tm e n t t o imp lemen ta t ion i s 
con t r ibu t ing t o further para lys is while crea t ing the i l l u s i o n o f ac t ion . T o fu r the r comp l ica te matters, 
the adop t ion o f n e w p o l i c y and regu la to ry frameworks o f ten leads t o the p r o l i f e r a t i o n o f n ew 
organ iza t ions o r the rearrangements o f o l d ones, w i t h o u t a clear breakaway f r o m o l d t o new. This 
tends t o generate fu r the r ine r t ia and con fus ion regard ing the respons ib i l i t ies o f ove r lapp ing agencies 
and adds s tra in o n the l im i t e d resources. The decen tra l iza t ion p rog ram i s m a k i n g the p r o b l em mo re 
acute. 

3 . 

Several situations i l lus t ra te the p r o b l em and w i l l need t o be addressed. First, the PRSP i s 
f requen t ly men t ioned by governmen t o f f i c i a l s as the sole frame o f reference f o r a l l o f M a l i ’ s 
deve lopmen t strategies and programs. But in r e a l i t y it has n o t yet acqu ired the characteristics o f an 
i n s t i t u t i o n mean t t o guide co l lec t ive deve lopmen t ac t ion . Second, the na t iona l s ta t is t ica l system 
continues t o be in d isarray even though d iagnos t ic studies have been ca r r ied ou t and a sound remed ia l 
master p l a n exists. The master p l a n has been endorsed but i s n o t b e i n g imp lemen ted . Third, with 
regard t o decentralization, even though the o f f i c i a l p o l i c y and organ iza t iona l f ramewo rk has been 
approved and p romu lga ted since 2002 with regard to education, health, and water, very l i t t l e has 
happened. In par t icu lar , the governmen t has yet t o e f fec t ive ly imp lemen t the framework , w h i c h w o u l d 
have translated i n t o rea l trans fer o f respons ib i l i ty and resources, b o t h f i n a n c i a l and human, t o 
mun ic ipa l i t ies and other decen tra l ized e n t i t i e s . And four th , the N a t i o n a l Comm i t tee f o r Capac i ty 
Building produced a capac i ty building p o l i c y tha t has n o t been disseminated outside the ministry in 
charge o f p l a n n i n g even though it was endorsed by the governmen t in September 2005. 

4. 
The governmen t agrees tha t putting an end t o this s i tua t ion can b e done b y : building s tab i l i ty 
and c r e d i b i l i t y in the ins t i tu t iona l framework ; adop t ing a r igo rous process f o r t rans i t ion ing f r om p o l i c y 
and master p l a n f o rm u l a t i o n t o imp lemen ta t ion ; lea rn ing t o ca r ry o u t organ iza t iona l r e f o rm and s k i l l s 
upg rad ing with a v i e w t o adap t ing t o changes in the regu la tory f ramewo rk ; and p r o v i d i n g incen t ives 
f o r behav iora l change w h e n necessary. 

Building credibility in the policy and regulatory frameworks 

5 . 
A l t h o u g h sound p o l i c y f ramewo rks are usua l ly available, they have yet t o fully p l a y the r o l e 
o f “ru les o f the game” by w h i c h actors must p l a y and that are c r i t i c a l f o r capac i ty t o deve lop . One o f 

- 9 8 - 

the reasons f o r tha t i s the i r i n s t a b i l i t y due t o the rad ica l ly d i f fe ren t p o l i c y op t ions tha t have been t r ied 
in r a p i d succession over the last 40 years while M a l i was in a state o f constant re forms . This i s 
pa r t icu la r ly v i s i b l e in the hea l th and educa t ion sectors. I t makes i t d i f f i c u l t f o r government 
imp lemen ters t o understand and lea rn the i r roles, and deve lop t h e i r s k i l l s . In these conditions, there i s 
n o oppo r tun i ty f o r adjustments and f o r lea rn ing f r om lessons. Worse, stakeholders d o n o t fully trust 
the government’s a b i l i t y t o stay the course in the face o f the m a n y challenges tha t consensual p o l i c y 
mak ing , though laudable, i n e v i t a b l y create. H a v i n g been used t o frequen t changes in p o l i c y directions 
in the past, be it as a resu l t o f in te rna l fac tors o r external pressures, stakeholders come t o expect s t i l l 
further changes. This behav io r promo tes iner t ia . Hence, bringing s t a b i l i t y t o the curren t p o l i c y and 
regu la tory f ramewo rk i s essential. 

Providing incentives f o r behavioral change 

6 . 

Once the p o l i c y f r am ew o r k i s s tab i l ized and i s truly considered as the reference, the rema in ing 
p rob lem w i l l be t o find the right incen t ives f o r behav iora l change o f governmen t imp lemen ters and 
other stakeholders. With regard t o c i v i l servants, the government’s i n t e n t i o n t o reduce the number o f 
s t a f f and s imu l taneous ly increase wages i s a step in the right d i rec t ion but w i l l take t im e t o implement. 
In the meantime, o ther incen t ives can be used t o mo t iva te c i v i l servants, i n c l u d i n g adop t ing career 
plans, p r o v i d i n g oppo r tun i ty f o r advancement through mer i t , linking t r a i n i n g and promo t ion , using 
mo re mode rn me thods and equ ipmen t in the administration, 
i d e n t i f y i n g and e l im i n a t i n g reverse 
incentives, fighting c o r r u p t i o n aggressively, and depo l i t ic iz ing the c i v i l service. 

Designing training as a step in the capacity development process 

7 . 

As the i n s t i t u t i o n a l f ramewo rk i s made t o w o r k better, focus must also be p laced on 
know ledge and s k i l l s . Given tha t a l l development actions are co l lec t ive actions, this means ensuring 
tha t i n d i v i d u a l actors acqu ire a be t ter understanding o f the i r ro les o n the team. In M a l i , the number o f 
tra ined and experienced s t a f f in the p u b l i c sector i s low , even when compared t o other SSA countries. 
M a n y pos i t ions in k e y agencies are n o t filled because o f the l a c k o f q u a l i f i e d candidates and positions 
o f respons ib i l i ty must o f t e n be f i l l e d with candidates fresh ou t o f schoo l . T h e needs created by 
decen tra l iza t ion p o l i c y are accen tua t ing the prob lem . A lso , the coun t ry faces a shortage o f t ra in ing 
fac i l i t ies . Howeve r , t r a i n i n g i s n o t a panacea and must n o t be cons idered as an end in i t s e l f as it 
curren t ly o f ten i s . T h e r e l a t i v e l y recent focus o n “capacity building” has l e d t o the m u l t i p l i c a t i o n o f 
workshops, seminars, and know ledge exchange forums with l i t t l e tang ib le results, t o the po in t that 
M a l i a n au thor i t ies and donors are n o w open ly c r i t i c a l o f the “wo rkshop cu l ture” tha t has resulted. The 
f i r s t step towa rd addressing this s i tua t ion i s t o make a clearer d is t inc t ion be tween t r a i n i n g and capacity 
development. The second step i s t o make sure that know ledge and s k i l l s enhancement ac t iv i t ies are 
designed as an in termed ia te step t ow a r d stronger performance and under taken p r im a r i l y with a view to

Resu l ts and im p a c t d r i v e the Bank ’s assistance strategy. This requ ires changes in the way the

finance 

Recurrent cost

Local costfinancing. 
Are the requirements for 
Bank financing o f local 
expenditures met, 
namely that: (a) 
financing requirements 

for the country’s 

development program 
would exceed the public 
sector’s own resources 
(e.g., from taxation and 
other revenues) and 
expected domestic 
borrowing; and (b) the 
financing o f foreign 
expenditures alone 
would not enable the 
Bank to assist in the 
financing o f individual 
projects 
Taxes and duties. Are 
there any taxes and 
duties that the Bank 
would not finance? 

~~ 

~ 

Remarks / Explanation 
The Bank may finance, on a selective basis, up to 100% o f project costs. 
The Bank’s financing proportion in individual projects w i l l be 
determined taking into account: (a) the overall I D A envelope fo r Mali; 
(b) the importance o f the project to the PRSP and i t s poverty focus; and 
(c) the prioritization o f the project in the CAS. The M a l i program i s 
increasingly focused on SWAPS which include financing from several 
other donors. In these cases, Bank financing w i l l l ike ly be a relatively 
small share o f project cost. I t i s expected that cost sharing w i l l apply to 
projects w i th contributions from other non-government sources such as 
donors and beneficiaries (particularly for CDD-projects). Cost sharing 
also w i l l l ike ly be the r u l e for projects w i th revenue generating en t i t ies . 
Given Ma l i ’s fragile financial situation, the Bank w i l l continue to 
monitor the aggregate fiscal and debt situation and i t s implications for 
recurrent cost financing. In a l l cases, recurrent cost financing w i l l be 
applied after consideration o f the sector and project sustainability i s s u e s 
including: (a) institutional arrangements to allow for greater emphasis 
on sustainability through result-based M & E systems and strengthening 
o f capacity at national and local level; and (b) implied future budget 
outlays. 
The two requirements are met. The Bank expects to finance local costs 
in the proportions needed for individual projects, up to 100%. 

N o 
country- 
level l im i t 

Yes 

None 

The Bank may finance the costs o f taxes and duties associated w i th 
project expenditures, since these have been judged to be reasonable and 
non-discriminatory. A t the project-level, the Bank would consider 
whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively h igh share o f project 
costs. Local tax regimes w i l l be monitored as decentralization becomes 
more advanced and w i l l be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
