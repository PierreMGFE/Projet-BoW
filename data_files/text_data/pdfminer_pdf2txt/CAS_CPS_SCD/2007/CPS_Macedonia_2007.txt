COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 

Background. Progress in the fo rme r Yugos lav Repub l ic o f Macedon ia (fYR Macedonia) 
over the past f ew years has been impressive. In 2001, the coun t ry was an IDA bo r rowe r and 
recovering f r om the economic, p o l i t i c a l and soc ia l fa l lou t o f an in te rna l con f l ic t . Today (2007), 
N R Macedon ia i s an IBRD bo r rowe r and enjoys EU candidate status. O n the economic front, 
macroeconomic stability and predictability have steadily increased, i n f l a t i o n has remained under 
control, and ba r r ie rs t o market entry and ex i t have b e e n reduced by simplifying and accelerating 
registration and bankruptcy procedures. Meanwh i le , though, economic g r ow t h and f o rm a l sector 
j o b creation have been d isappo in t ing . G r ow t h has averaged o n l y 3.5 percent over the 2003-2006 
period. Such g r ow t h rates p lace f Y R Macedon ia among the slowest g r ow i n g economies in E C A 
in this pe r iod . A lso , the recove ry remains n a r r ow l y based o n a few key sectors and 
unemployment remains high. W h i l e o f f i c i a l data have cons is ten t ly overstated unemployment, at 
over 30 percent, fYR Macedon ia ’s o f f i c i a l unemp loymen t rate i s among the highest in the 
region. 

ii. 

Since 1990, the Bank has actively supported the country’s transition. 

During the 

1 9 9 0 ~ ~ B a n k support was focused on building the foundations o f a ma rke t economy and a stable 
macroeconomic f ramewo rk . B a n k assistance was p r im a r i l y focused o n r e f o rm o f the f i n a n c i a l 
and enterprise sector, agriculture, human development p u b l i c sector re fo rm , in f ras t ruc tu re and 
energy, th rough a series o f sector adjustment loans accompanied by inves tmen t lending. S i n c e 
fYR Macedon ia j o i n e d the W o r l d Bank G roup in 1993, IDA and IBRD comm i tmen ts to the 
coun t ry through 38 operations to ta l app rox ima te ly U S $ 780 m i l l i o n and I F C commitments t o t a l 
over $93 m i l l i o n in I F C funds and m o r e than $25 m i l l i o n in syndications.

Th e WBG w i l l support j YR Macedon ia in its efforts 
to j o i n the Eu ropean Un ion . 
Overall, the proposed C o u n t r y Partnership Strategy aims t o accelerate fYR Macedonia’s 
perspective t o j o i n the European U n i o n . The proposed p rog ram i s w e l l grounded in the p o l i c y 
p r io r i t ies o f the government and t a k e s full account o f the p r io r i t ies as de f ined in the S tab i l i ty and 
Association p rog ram (SAP), and resu l ts f r o m consultations with the government and other 
stakeholders. 
In the n e x t fou r years, fYR Macedon ia needs s ign i f ican t investments in i t s 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity. The r o a d t o Eu rope w i l l n o t o n l y requ i re the coun t ry t o d e s i g n and adopt

process, i n c l u d i n g by p r o v i d i n g “bridge” f inanc ing t o a l l ow f Y R Macedon ia t o bene f i t faster

The CPS aims to support the government’s program around two core p i l la rs : i) 
fostering economic growth, j o b creation, and increasing the l iv ing standards o f a l l ; and (ii) 
im p r o v i n g the governance and transparency o f pub l ic service de l ive ry t o support the market 
economy. 

v i i i . P i l la r 1: Foster Growth and Job Creation, Increase L iv ing Standards for All. The 
WBG w i l l support the governments’ amb i t ious goals o n accelerated g r ow t h and j o b creation 
th rough an integrated and multi faceted p rog ram . Under th is p i l la r , the WBG w i l l a i m to (i)

school enrolment and p reven t ive health.

P i l la r 2: Pub l ic Service De l ivery and Supporting Good Governance. Under this p i l la r , 
the CPS aims to support fYR Macedon ia in con t inu ing the progress made in im p r o v i n g 

v i i 

governance and reduc ing co r rup t ion , while deepening re fo rms in k e y sectors where governance 
weaknesses continue t o unde rm ine progress in the economic re fo rms necessary t o strengthen the 
Im p r o v e d transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in service delivery i s 
economy and create jobs . 
c r i t ica l to meet the gove rnmen t p rog ram o n g row th , foster human capital, and meet EU 
standards. The WBG w i l l support f Y R Macedon ia in i t s e f fo r ts t o (i) con t inue i t s efforts t o 
imp rove the env i ronmen t o f lega l uncertainty and lack o f con f idence in the j u d i c i a l system; (ii)

services, and (iv) make cash transfer systems m o r e targeted and in t roduce incentives t o 
encourage school en ro lmen t and p reven t ive health.

The need for B an k lending i s significant over the next four years but i s subsequently 
likely to wind down as f vR Macedon ia moves toward EU Accession and eventual graduation. 

The volume o f the p roposed lending envelope under the CPS i s s ign i f ican t . The proposed base 
case lending envelope equals the high case lending envelope o f the 2003 -2006 CAS . Th is l e v e l 
accommodates the government’s in ten t ion to w o r k c lose ly with the WBG o n k e y areas o f their 
r e f o rm agenda in order to acce lera te conve rs ion towards EU leve ls and t o help build the capacity 
to access and implement EU pre-accession funds. At the end o f the CPS period, however, i t i s 
expected that the coun t ry w i l l have gained access t o s ign i f ican t EU pre-accession funds, reduc ing 
subsequent b o r r ow i n g s ign i f ican t ly . 

Actual lending w i l l be determined by thepace of reforms in key sectors. The pace o f 

x i . 
reforms thus far, comb ined w i th fYR Macedonia’s creditworthiness and low, but stable growth, 
warrant a p rog ram o f lending support that w o u l d encourage progress under the t w o m a i n pillars 
o f the CPS. The base case inc ludes b o t h investment and adjustment lending, and envisages tw o 
o r th ree new loans pe r year, f o r a to ta l o f US$220 m i l l i o n ove r the f o u r years. Under the high 
case scenario, th is lend ing p r o g r am c o u l d b e augmented by two m o r e inves tmen t loans, fo r a 
to ta l o f an add i t iona l U S $ 6 0 m i l l i o n over the fou r years. T r igge rs f o r the base case require 
continued satisfactory mac roeconom ic performance, and proposes se lec ted ind ica to rs to make 

continued progress o n t h e bus iness c l ima te , while maintaining stability and a con t inua t ion o f 

satisfactory p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance . The triggers f o r the high case requ i re mee t ing a l l f i s c a l 
targets inc luded in the IMF p r o g r am as well meeting specific triggers o n the energy sector and o n 
the compe t i t ion agenda. Deve lopmen ts in f Y R Macedon ia are chang ing rap id ly ; the lending 
p rog ram w i l l be rev iewed during the p lanned CPS Progress Repo r t (FY09), t o ensu re that WBG 
support remains fully responsive t o e v o l v i n g needs in the country.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Progress in the fo rme r Yugos lav Repub l ic o f Macedon ia ( N R Macedon ia ) over the past 
few years has been impressive. In 2001, the country was an IDA b o r r ow e r and recove r ing f r om 
the economic, p o l i t i c a l and soc ia l fa l lou t o f an in te rna l con f l ic t . T o d a y (2007), N R Macedon ia 
i s an IBRD bo r rowe r and enjoys EU candidate status, albeit w i t h o u t a clear date t o start the 
negotiations. The coun t ry has app l ied f o r NATO membership, and hopes t o j o i n in 2008. 
Successive Macedon ian governments have made considerable e f fo r ts t o imp lemen t the O h r i d 
F ramewo rk Agreement, w h i c h p r o v i d e d the basis f o r reso lv ing the 2001 ethnic con f l ic t . T o 
complement this p o l i t i c a l progress, 
f Y R Macedon ia governments have been pursuing an 
ambitious economic r e f o rm p rog ram and have s u c c e s s f u l l y preserved mac ro -econom ic stability, 
though g r ow t h pe r fo rmance has n o t been stellar, especially by reg iona l standards, and 
unemployment l e v e l s r em a i n extremely high. 

2. 
The proposed CPS f o r F Y 0 7 - 1 0 builds o n the experience o f the W o r l d B a n k G roup 
(WBG) s ince the ea r ly 1990s. I t aims at hamessing the con t r ibu t ions o f a l l parts o f the W o r l d 
Bank Group, i n c l u d i n g I F C and MIGA, and building o n fYR Macedon ia 's progress during the 
past few years. At the same time, the strategy i s designed t o support the government's goals o f 
tack l ing the stubborn challenges o f growth and unemp loymen t that face the coun t ry . Overall, the 
CPS aims to accelerate N R Macedon ia 's perspective to j o i n the Eu ropean U n i o n . Proposed 
activities envisaged under this CPS a re focused o n two p i l la rs : (i) fos te r ing job -c rea t ing 
economic growth, and inc reas ing l iv ing standards f o r all, and (ii) im p r o v i n g governance and 
transparency in p u b l i c sector delivery to support a ma rke t economy. The CPS w i l l employ a 
selected m i x o f investment and p o l i c y lending, a long with a robus t p r o g r am o f A n a l y t i c a l and 
Adv iso ry A c t i v i t i e s (AAA) w o r k t o support the CPS goals.

The Western Balkans region i s now much calmer and the EUpe rspec t ive is clearer, 
but the road is still long and risks remain. M o r e than a decade after the end o f the Bosn ia wa r 

and mo re than six years after the f a l l o f the M i l o s e v i c reg ime in Belgrade, the Western Ba lkans

5. 
Political developments in JYR Macedonia. Over the past 15 years, fYR Macedon ia has 
been mos t ly spared f r o m d i rec t v io lence seen elsewhere in the reg ion . The exception was an 
inter-ethnic c o n f l i c t in 2001, w h i c h ended s ix mon ths la te r w i th an in te rna t iona l ly mediated

rights o f ethnic A lban ians and other m i n o r i t y groups. Since 2003, considerable progress has 
been made in imp lemen t ing the O h r i d Agreement, including in enhancing the representation o f 
m ino r i t ies in gove rnmen ta l structures. In this context, fYR Macedon ia embarked o n a s ign i f ican t 
decentralization p rog ram . The country’s amb i t ion t o accede t o the EU also p rov ides strong 
reintegrating forces that -under the broader f ramewo rk o f ha rmon iza t ion with Europe- are 
fostering increasing econom ic and p o l i t i c a l t i e s within the r e g i o n and beyond. The t w o 
consecutive regu la r pa r l iamen ta ry elections in 2002 and 2006 we re h e l d p e a c e h l l y and largely 
democratically. Challenges remain, however, as tensions be tween the ru l ing coa l i t ion and the 
opposition are severe. As po in ted ou t in the latest E C Progress Repo r t (Novembe r 2006), the 
limited p o l i t i c a l dialogue se r ious ly impedes the country’s am b i t i o n t o accede t o the EU. 

6. 
EU accession. O n December 16, 2005 the European C o u n c i l granted candidate coun t ry 
status to fYR Macedon ia . The C o u n c i l made this dec is ion o n the basis o f the substantial

progress achieved, but n o t e d a s l ow d ow n in the pace o f re fo rms in 2006, p r o b a b l y due to the

need to sustain e f fo r ts in imp lemen t ing the O h r i d F ramewo rk Agreement.

Decentralization and urban development. 
Decentralization, a major element o f the 
O h r i d Agreement, has been unfolding in stages. I t was f o rm a l l y launched in m id -2005 . The

The civil conflict in 2001 disrupted a brief period of positive economic momentum. 
A l t h o u g h d i rec t damage f r o m the c o n f l i c t was l im i ted , investment a c t i v i t y m a r k e d l y dropped, 
and output contracted by 4.5 percent in 2001. Defense-related expenditures pushed the budget

in 2002 as investment and expo r t growth rema ined sluggish while budget and current account 
de f ic i ts rema ined high. 

9 . 
Economic recovery gradually took hold in subsequent years as the budget deficit was 
quickly eliminated in 2003 and structural reforms gradually resumed. T h e budget has 
remained r o u g h l y balanced s ince 2003 while expenditures were reduced f r o m 40 percent o f GD P

The ove ra l l balance o f payments has strengthened considerably as gross reserves increased t o 
about 4.5 mon ths o f imports. In this environment, external and p u b l i c debt ra t ios have gradually 
declined t o l e s s than 40 percent o f GDP. 

10. While prudent macroeconomic policies have f i rm l y established macroeconomic 
stability, economic growth and formal sector job creation have been disappointing. Recorded 
g row th has averaged o n l y 3.5 percent over the 2003-2006 pe r iod . Such g r ow t h rates p lace fYR 
Macedon ia among the slowest growing economies in E C A in this period. A lso , the recove ry

Growth has generated some jobs -but few well pay ing jobs- which may explain the 

15. 
slow poverty reduction. Be tween the f i r s t quarter o f 2004 and the second quarter o f 2006, 
employment rates4 increased f r o m around 33 percent t o a round 35 percent. The h ighe r 
employment rates re f lec t an increase in ac t iv i ty rates -more peop le h o l d i n g o r l o o k i n g fo r a job - 
coupled w i th a sma l l f a l l in unemp loymen t rates. Pove r ty data are n o t ava i lab le f o r this year, but 
given the strong co r re la t ion be tween pove r ty and unemployment, chances are that they w i l l have 
fallen, i f o n l y slightly. T h e we l fa re o f the poo r in pa r t icu la r has been adversely impac ted by the

OUTLOOK

Prospects for faster growth have improved. 

Ove r the last fou r years, a number o f 
impo r tan t re fo rms have been imp lemen ted . Mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty and p red ic tab i l i ty have 
steadily increased, i n f l a t i o n has rema ined under control, and ba r r ie rs t o ma rke t entry and ex i t 
have been reduced by simplifying and accelerating reg is t ra t ion and bank rup tcy procedures. The 
launch o f a new “one-stop shop” business reg is t ra t ion system in January 2006 s ign i f ican t ly eased 
the time, cost and burden o f registering new bus iness . The new system p rov ides a transparent 
reg is t ra t ion fo r new bus inesses and has reduced reg is t ra t ion t im e f r o m 48 days t o 5 days. A 
comprehensive j u d i c i a l r e f o rm was launched in 2005 wh ich , i f v igo rous ly implemented, w i l l

in a c r i t i c a l dialogue with social partners rega rd ing an ove rhau l o f the labo r l a w and ins t i tu t ions 
t o in t roduce mo re flexibility i n t o fYR Macedon ian labo r markets, a new L a b o r L a w was enacted 
in Ju ly 2005. In the b a n k i n g sector, supervision, regulations as w e l l as governance are being 
strengthened. F ina l ly , the coun t ry has been successfully b rough t t o cand idacy status o f the 
European U n i o n . The latest Progress Repo r t o f the European Comm iss ion notes that f Y R 
Macedon ia i s w e l l advanced in establishing a func t ion ing ma rke t economy, h a v i n g ma in ta ined a 
b road consensus o n the essentials o f economic policies, though sustained e f fo r ts w i l l rema in 
c r i t ica l to enable the coun t ry t o cope w i th compe t i t ive p ressu re and ma rke t forces within the 
U n i o n in the med ium - te rm . 

19. 

Bu t challenges remain. E n t e r p r i s e s in fYR Macedon ia have n o t undergone the dynam ics 

o f res t ruc tu r ing witnessed in other countries in the region. This i s in pa r t due t o the poo r 
corporate governance w h i c h emerged f o l l ow i n g p r iva t iza t ion (see paragraph 41 be low ) . U n f a i r 
compe t i t ion practices s t i l l occur and m a y discourage po ten t ia l n ew f i r m s f r o m entering the 
market. In fact, fYR Macedon ia has been m u c h less successful than other countries in the reg ion 
in attracting g r e e n f i e l d FDI and new domestic f i r m s . In a number o f t rans i t ion countries, de 
novo sma l l and medium enterprises have been a m a j o r source o f new j o b creation. 
Un fo r tuna te ly , fYR Macedon ia lags far behind in this area. FYR Macedon ia ’s inves tmen t t o 
GDP ra t io also lags behind faster g r ow i n g t rans i t ion countries. Ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses, such as 
cumbersome adm in is t ra t ive procedures and co r rup t ion , as well as a l o w degree o f lega l ce r ta in ty 
and p red ic tab i l i ty o f economic and regu la to ry po l ic ies encumber the business c l ima te and a 
proper func t ion ing o f the ma rke t economy. L a b o r and f inanc ia l markets are s t i l l func t ion ing 
unevenly, and the i n f o rm a l sector distorts the economy, resulting in u n f a i r compe t i t ion practices 
and weaker consumers’ p ro tec t ion . 
These f laws in the inves tmen t c l ima te have been 

6 

C o u n t y Partnership Strategy f o r j Y R Macedon ia FYO7-I 0 

compounded by weak p u b l i c sector governance w h i c h further unde rm ines inves to r sentiment. 
Improvements in this area w i l l be essential, also t o deal with t h e comp lex EU accession 
requirements. 

Priorities o f the government 

A new government took office with great ambitions. A n ew c o a l i t i o n was elected to 

20. 
o f f ice in Ju ly 2006 o n a very concrete e lec t ion manifesto entitled “Reb i r th in 100 Steps.” These 
100 s teps focus p redom inan t ly o n economic re fo rms a imed at accelerating economic g row th 
f r om i t s current l e v e l o f 3.5-4 percent t o 6-8 percent in the n e x t few years. The Man i fes to was 
endorsed by a l l c o a l i t i o n partners, and, in Ju ly 2006, the gove rnmen t presented their new 
p rog ram fo r the p e r i o d 2006 -2010 t o the Parliament. The m a i n goals o f the p rog ram are to 
imp rove the l iv ing standards o f a l l citizens, increase employment, strengthen the fight against 
corruption, further develop democracy, and imp rove in te r -e thn ic re la t ions and p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty . 

EU and NATO membership. 

21. 
The p rog ram says EU and NATO in teg ra t ion are o f 
paramount p r i o r i t y f o r fYR Macedonia, and plans t o f ina l ize the r em a i n i n g reforms, while 
p romo t ing peace and s tab i l i ty in the coun t ry and in the r e g i o n th rough respect o f democratic 
principles. 

Spur dynamic economic development, reduce the grey economy and create jobs. To 

22. 
achieve the stretched goals o f accelerated g r ow t h and j o b creation, the government’s strategy 
includes a wide rang ing se t o f po l ic ies t o spur economic a c t i v i t y and create j o b s and increase 
living standards o f the popu la t ion . Some active labo r ma rke t po l ic ies are envisaged as well. 
W i t h i n a disciplined, though slightly m o r e re laxed f isca l p o l i c y f ramewo rk , the government has 
started t o reduce taxes and red i rec t p u b l i c spending towards cap i ta l investments. 

23. 

Improve business climate. S t ruc tu ra l re fo rms t o im p r o v e the inves tmen t c l ima te are 
central to the program, in pa r t icu la r by: (i) reduc ing the burden o f superfluous business 
regulations by in t roduc ing a regu la to ry “gu i l lo t ine ” ( fo r existing regulations) and requ i r ing a 
regulatory impac t assessment ( f o r n ew regulations); (ii) reduc ing the business reg is t ra t ion 
process time further f r o m five t o three days; (iii) comp le t ing the l a n d cadastre and rea l estate

Implementation of thep rog ram has started. A numbe r o f concrete steps o f the P rog ram 

have already b e e n implemented. Within months o f t a k i n g o f f ice , the government reduced the 
VAT fo r selected ag r icu l tu re inputs and -effective January 2007- corporate and personal income 
tax rates were reduced and unified. At 12 percent, these rates are n o w among the lowes t in the 
region. The zero taxa t ion p o l i c y o n reinvested p r o f i t s has been in t roduced as well, with a 50 
percent cap to limit loss o f revenue . A third m o b i l e telephone p rov ide r was licensed in Feb rua ry 
2007 , the regu la to ry “gu i l lo t ine ” system was launched in January 2007 , and many other 
measures are under preparation.

the 1990s occurred th rough “insider” buy -ou ts and this s t i l l affects -even after 10 years- the

Foreign D i rec t Investment (FDI) and trade with more developed countries w i l l help 
improve the competitiveness of Macedonian companies. In general, Macedon ian companies 

need t o imp rove their competitiveness; they are ad jus t ing too s l ow l y t o n e w ma rke t opportunities 
and investing too l i t t l e in techno logy adaptation, development o f n e w products, and in t ra in ing

Bu lga r ia and Roman ia t o the EU, N R Macedon ia n o w enjoys tw o EU borders (with Greece to 
the south). This a l lows f o r increased investments and access t o the deep EU market, but also 
bears the risk that trade and t rans i t mo re easily bypasses t h e coun t ry altogether. Thus, actions to 
alleviate n o n - t a r i f f cross bo rde r ba r r ie rs become even m o r e pressing. 

43. 

Improv ing ag r icu l tu ra l competitiveness is especially important , also in view of the EU 

accession process. A g r i c u l t u r e accounts f o r 16 percent o f GDP and some 20 percent o f 
employment. The sector i s also c ruc ia l f o r the r u r a l economy, whe re almost h a l f the popu la t ion

and supply chains as well as underdeveloped land and r u r a l c red i t markets. As with other 
countries in the region, inc reas ing trade l ibe ra l iza t ion and mode rn iza t ion o f the economy are 
transforming Macedon ian agriculture. W h i l e opportunities presented by increased trade are 
great, un less producers and ago-processors can become m o r e compe t i t ive , they w i l l have trouble 
ma in ta in ing and inc reas ing external and in te rna l ma rke t share as low -cos t , h igh -qua l i ty impo r ts

44. 

Ove rcom ing these constraints calls f o r e f fec t ive p u b l i c sector actions t o resolve ma rke t 
failures and create an enab l ing environment 
f o r the p r iva te sector th rough transparent, 
predictable po l ic ies and regu la t ions and investment in p u b l i c goods. FYR Macedon ia ’s recen t ly 
acquired status as an EU candidate coun t ry p resen ts oppo r tun i t ies in the f o r m o f s ign i f ican t

addition, the labo r shedding that w i l l occur once the sector becomes m o r e compe t i t ive w i l l 
require ca re fu l management. 

45. 
Efficient 
infrastructure and energy supply a re also necessary for spurr ing growth, 
increasing internat iona l trade and improving the business c l imate more genera l ly . Excep t f o r 

some bottlenecks, the capac i ty o f the r o a d and r a i l transport in f ras t ruc tu re i s su f f ic ien t but

Labor market regulations and institutions a re important for protecting workers, but 
they also can p lay a key ro le in supporting growth and j o b creation. The 2005 Labo r L a w 

represen ts an impo r tan t step in bringing Macedon ian labo r ma rke t r u l e s in l i n e with the no rms o f 
a market economy, but the r e f o rm agenda i s s t i l l incomp le te . En te rp r ise surveys suggest that 
almost one - th i rd o f f i r m s s t i l l consider labo r regu la t ions as a severe factor constraining their 
g row th and, therefore, j o b creation. Further re fo rms t o make con t rac t ing m o r e f lex ib le are 
needed. Mo reove r , comp l iance with labo r laws i s s t i l l problematic, w h i c h hinders b o t h wo rke r 
p ro tec t ion and the fo rma l iza t ion o f employment. A l t h o u g h m o r e appropriate regulations shou ld 
na tu ra l ly lead t o better self-enforcement, im p r o v i n g the enforcement capacity o f the L a b o r 
Inspectorate w i l l also be needed t o reduce non - reg is t ra t ion and other fo rms o f non -comp l iance . 

Reducing the labor tax wedge would encourage j o b creat ion . In fYR Macedonia, the 

47. 
labor tax wedge i s around 40 percent with l i t t l e va r ia t ion by wage l e v e l s . The tax wedge has 
already been reduced slightly w i th recent changes in the income tax. The government i s 
considering reduc ing p a y r o l l taxes further by sw i tch ing to general budget f inanc ing o f hea l th 
expenditures. Cuts in social con t r ibu t ions need t o be analyzed ca re fu l ly t o assess b o t h the likely 
employment p a y o f f as well as the f isca l imp l ica t ions f o r the soc ia l insurance funds. The 
administration o f the co l lec t ion shou ld be addressed as well. T h e new system o f co l lec t ing 
pension con t r ibu t ions has been implemented since January 2006 and a l lows better con t ro l o f 
compliance, a l though -as fo r a l l social contributions- the enforcement system s t i l l needs to b e 
strengthened. The impo r tan t ha rmon iza t ion o f con t r ibu t ion bases across the d i f fe ren t sys tems i s 
n ow underway. The basis f o r ca lcu la t ing con t r ibu t ions shou ld be shifted f r o m the current ne t - 
wage basis t o a simpler gross-wage fo rmu la that i s considered best practice, and has already been 
imp lemen ted elsewhere in the region. 

Skills of 

the workforce need to be upgraded. In fYR Macedonia, about one-quarter o f 

48. 

f i r m s identify the s k i l l s o f the wo rk fo rce as a serious obstacle t o growth, but in m o r e dynam ic 
sectors, s k i l l s appear t o be a m o r e serious p rob lem . As the coun t ry fu r the r integrates i n t o the 
European and g loba l economies, i t w i l l need to seriously r e f o rm education at a l l leve ls t o ensure 
that i t s wo rk fo rce remains compe t i t ive . As these e f fo r ts are l o n g t e r m in nature, ac t ion needs t o 
be taken n ow . Educa t ion and t ra in ing have simply n o t k e p t up with the chang ing demands o f the 
pos t - t rans i t ion economy. At least 40 percent o f today’s you th do n o t f i n i s h secondary school. 
In te rna t iona l assessments o f lea rn ing outcomes consistently show that young Macedonians have 
n o t achieved the skill l e v e l s o f the i r counterparts in the EU and other OECD countries. The 
government has proposed making secondary education compu lso ry and this i s an impo r tan t step. 
But i t needs t o be accompanied by a s ign i f ican t shift in the type o f c u r r i c u l um and teaching 
o f fe red to students; away f r o m na r row voca t iona l ly -o r ien ted courses towards stronger general 
education competencies plus encouraging creativity, team wo rk , and p rob lem -so lv ing . There i s 
also v i r t u a l l y n o oppo r tun i ty f o r the la rge number o f dropouts t o get back o n t rack th rough 
second chance programs. 
In higher education, fYR Macedon ia needs t o press ahead w i th 
re fo rm ing the c u r r i c u l um t o make i t m o r e relevant t o the labo r market, t o fulfill the requirements 
o f in teg ra t ion i n t o the European h ighe r education area ( the B o l o g n a Process), and t o restructure 
i t s research capacity. 

49. 

Social protection programs can safeguard the income of workers f rom shocks to 
employment, and can help them reintegrate into the labor ma rke t . The task o f cush ion ing

The effectiveness of 
the other two key elements of social protection for workers - 
unemployment benefits and active labor market programs (ALMPs) - also needs to be 
significantly improved. Currently, unemp loymen t insurance does n o t p l a y i t s intended r o l e o f

have signaled that they in tend t o be p roac t ive in addressing co r rup t ion . A l t h o u g h ce r ta in 
p r inc ip les o f good governance are un ive rsa l -transparency, accoun tab i l i ty , and vo ice for 
example- the binding constraints are n o t the same in a l l sectors. In some areas the ins t i tu t ions o f 
transparency are strong, while the capacity f o r imp lemen ta t ion i s weak; in others ma jo r sector 
reorganizations m a y be required t o reduce the incentives f o r co r rup t behav io r . This CPS calls f o r 
an expanded focus o n the mos t c r i t i c a l governance weaknesses and t h e ways that the WBG can 
w o r k w i t h N R Macedon ia t o address them. Some ac t iv i t ies w i l l b e o r ien ted d i rec t ly towa rd

but also greater efficiency 

in the public sector. FYR Macedon ia ’s e f fo r ts to imp rove

customs as measured by two independent su rveys o f f i r m s (F igu re 4). At the same time, the

Progress in improving business entry is beginning to be matched in imposing discipline

authority in con t ro l l ing the p rac t ice o f giving subsidized energy p r ices f o r large energy 
consumers and the excessive tolerance o f arrears. These lingering practices leave unsubsidized 
f i r m s at a clear disadvantage.

The dua l challenge o f building a we l l -gove rned state regu la to ry system f o r u t i l i t i e s , while 
also ensuring that the (monopo l is t ic ) p rov ide rs achieve cost recovery, i s a p t l y i l lus t ra ted by the

Judicial corruption in f r R Macedonia has largely been tied to the politicization of the 
selection and disciplining of 
judges, as well as opaque court proceedings and lack of 

enforcement. S ign i f ican t steps were taken in 2005 and 2006 t o address th is s i tua t ion w i th the 
adoption o f cons t i tu t iona l amendments and fundamental leg is la t ion . Howeve r , imp lemen ta t ion

the jud ic ia ry . The adop t ion o f new L aw s o n C i v i l Procedure, Enforcement, Adm in is t ra t ive 
Disputes and M isdemeano rs are designed to reduce the b a c k l o g in the courts and speed the 
j u d i c i a l reso lu t ion o f disputes. W h i l e new p r iva te enforcement agents have begun t o operate, 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the other laws remains a challenge. T h e r e v i s i o n o f sector laws, con t inued

that agencies such as the dena t iona l iza t ion commissions a re ne i the r ope ra t ing e f fec t ive ly n o r

Governance problems need to be addressed in many state agencies and in rema in ing 

public enterprises. F o r example, u n o f f i c i a l payments f o r o f f i c i a l l a n d o r rea l estate registrations 
o r even to receive i n f o rm a t i o n are n o t unusual, c rea t ing a k e y constraint ove r rea l p rope r ty rights. 
Ano the r example relates t o the maintenance in fYR Macedon ia 's r o a d system, w h i c h has been 
hindered by b o t h lack o f transparency in oversight au tho r i ty and by substantial leakages in the 
co l lec t ion o f to l ls . 
I t i s n o t d i f f i c u l t t o find s im i la r examples in other p u b l i c e n t e r p r i s e s and 
agencies. The government i s w o r k i n g o n p lans t o deal with this, either by p r iva t iz ing , fo r 
example, the p u b l i c en te rp r ise f o r housing, o r by adop t ing a comprehensive strategy f o r sector 
reform, f o r example, in forestry. Howeve r , w i t h o u t b road r e f o rm o f the process o f selection and 
accountability o f p u b l i c sector managers, these are n o t l i k e l y t o give las t ing results. 

62. 

Moreover, local pub l ic enterprises still rema in largely unaccountable, w ith little 
the 

commercial orientation. M o s t p u b l i c u t i l i t i e s operate o n the l o c a l leve lg -specifically, 
communa l services e n t e r p r i s e s and u t i l i t i e s p r o v i d i n g water and sanitation, s o l i d waste 
management, and u rban transport. The ins t i tu t iona l and lega l f ramewo rk f o r these e n t e r p r i s e s 
p rov ides insu f f ic ien t incen t ives f o r operational o r f inanc ia l e f f ic iency , and incentives t o select 
managers based o n qua l i f ica t ion i s o f ten absent. With the government intent o n pursuing large 
investment projects (most no tab ly in energy and infrastructure) ove r the next few years, the lega l 
f ramewo rk o n use o f concessions, unso l ic i ted bids and p r iva te -pub l ic partnerships needs to be 
ca re fu l ly reviewed t o ensure that these are made in a transparent, compe t i t ive , and cost-effective 
manner. 

63 . 

I n education and hea lth there have been steps to improve accountability. W h i l e 

co r rup t ion remains a p r o b l em in education," 
in order t o im p r o v e transparency, fYR Macedon ia 
i s n o w deve lop ing a high q u a l i t y and comprehensive student assessment and tes t ing system. The 
full-scale in t roduc t ion o f a na t iona l exam ina t ion at the end o f secondary educa t ion (Matura) in 
2008 w i l l imp rove the o b j e c t i v i t y o f access t o te r t ia ry education, and a s e r i e s o f na t iona l 
assessments w i l l measure system performance. In addition, capacity and accoun tab i l i ty have 
imp roved at the school l e v e l , because a l l schools n o w have Schoo l Boa rds with representation 
f r om parents, that are required t o prepare a schoo l development plan, and w i l l unde rgo a p e r i o d 
evaluation ( inc lud ing b o t h external and in te rna l processes). Ensuring these systems w o r k 
e f fec t ive ly i s essential and the p r i o r i t y f o r the n e x t period. FYR Macedon ia also has ye t t o make 
good use o f the eme rg ing data o n performance. In health, no to r ious f o r i t s governance issues ,

B. Lessons Learned from the CAS Completion Report (CASCR) 

86. 
The C A S C R (Annex 2), endorsed conclusions o f the JPPR and i d e n t i f i e d a numbe r o f 
lessons that fo rmed the basis o f th is CPS. Some o f those lessons inc lude : 

The shwt in focus in the B an k ’ program over the 2003-2006 CAS period f rom public 
sector reform to private sector development issues was timely and appropriate, and 

should continue. Be tween 2002 and 2006, fYR Macedon ia rega ined strong mac ro 
d isc ip l ine and t rans fo rmed f r o m a pos t -con f l ic t coun t ry t o an EU candidate. In response, 
the B a n k shifted i t s p rog ram app rop r ia te ly t o dea l m o r e d i r e c t l y with economic g r ow t h 
constraints. This shou ld con t inue in the next CPS. 

The Bank needs to increase its focus on jYR Macedonia’s integration with the EU. 

EU accession i s a top p r i o r i t y f o r f Y R Macedonia, and t h e Bank needs to assist the 
coun t ry in meeting the accession c r i te r ia and the EU acquis, i n c l u d i n g o n building the 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity to e f fec t ive ly implement EU regulations. 

The EU accession process has major implications on budget allocation and priorities. 

The Bank’s funding c o u l d s e r v e as c r i t ica l bridge f inanc ing t o enable N R Macedon ia t o 
access EU pre-accession funds. The new P u b l i c Expend i tu re Review slated fo r delivery 
in FY07 shou ld analyze and p rov ide recommendations t o the Macedon ian Government 
o n the f isca l p o l i c y challenges the coun t ry faces in the run-up t o EU accession. 

Stronger economic growth and j o b creation must be achieved. In order to m a i n t a i n 

popu la r support f o r the r e f o rm agenda, the re i s a need f o r fYR Macedon ia t o show that i t s 
successful mac ro economic d isc ip l ine and structural r e f o rm in i t ia t ives do translate i n t o 
stronger growth, j o b c rea t ion and imp rovemen t o f l iv ing standards f o r a l l . 

FYR Macedonia’s competitiveness needs attention and role of education reform needs 

to increase. I f Macedon ian companies are t o compete in the reg iona l and in te rna t iona l 
markets, their competitiveness needs t o imp rove . Such a stronger compe t i t ive edge also 
requires a better m a t c h between the q u a l i t y o f education in N R Macedon ia w i th the 
needs o f the 2 1 St cen tu ry and t h e know ledge economy. 

The mu l t iyea r Policy Development Program has served the Bank ’s p rog ram well. The 

ongo ing three-year P D P L p rog ram helped in the shift o f p o l i c y p r io r i t ies , has been we l l 
connected t o a number o f investment projects, and he lped secure con t inu i ty and

different leve ls o f mutual agreement o n sector re fo rms and approaches across different areas, and 
with due regard to sus ta inab i l i ty and f iduc ia ry oversight. Since the establishment o f CFPs, tw o

121. The program, as well as the priorities for analytical work in the last two years of the

125. The E U p l a y s a central role in de f in ing f lR Macedonia’s development agenda. The 

Bank enjoys a close re la t ionsh ip with the EU, b o t h in Skop je and in Brussels. This close 
relationship has ensured a good m a t c h between EU and B a n k ac t iv i t ies (see Annex 10 f o r 
detailed i n f o rm a t i o n o n B a n k support in re la t ion to the European Partnership p rog ram ) . As pa r t 
o f the CPS preparation process, B a n k and E C coun t ry teams meet at least once eve ry year f o r a 
“fYR Macedon ia Coo rd ina t ion Day”. T h e meeting in 2006 focused o n compa r ing the strategic 
d i rec t ion o f E C (progress reports, mu l t i -annua l p rog ram support [MIPS]) and WBG programs, as 
we l l as exp lo red ways t o deepen operational collaboration. At p ro jec t level, B a n k operations 
closely f o l l ow (sometimes evo lv ing ) EU requirements to ensure consistency in p o l i c y advice. 

126. The Bank w i l l maintain coordination with the IMF, w h i c h i s expected to continue t o 

mon i to r the macroeconomic f ramewo rk under i t s ongo ing three-year SBA, and w i l l con t inue 
macro m o n i t o r i n g even w i t h o u t an ac t ive arrangement. The P D P L p r o g r am has been developed 
in close cooperation with the IMF. A lso , sectoral advice and lend ing ( f o r examp le hea l th and

have to take a mo re substantial r o l e in assessing mac roeconom ic performance, and w i l l in i t ia te

127. Ha rmon iza t ion w ith other development partners, in pa r t icu la r w i th the EC, USAID, the 
Dutch and Swedish Governments and the EBRD and the UN, i s a c r i t i c a l e lemen t o f the CPS 
imp lemen ta t ion strategy. The need t o leverage techn ica l and f inanc ia l resources p rov ided by 
other development partners, o f ten o n a concessional basis, i s c ruc ia l . In l i n e with p r inc ip les 
developed under the Pa r is agenda o n Aid Effectiveness, the gove rnmen t takes an inc reas ing ly

V I I . RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

129. CPS results mon itor ing w i l l be undertaken jo in t ly w ith the government. M o n i t o r i n g

systems and agencies for the comp i la t ion and ve r i f ica t ion o f results and milestones. The 
statistical system o f N R Macedon ia i s capable o f p roduc ing re l iab le and high qua l i ty statistics. 
The coverage o f the v i t a l reg is t ra t ion system i s re la t ive ly complete. With techn ica l ass is tance

V I I I . R I S K S AND MITIGATION REMEDIES 

130. Regional (in)stability in the region w i l l greatly influence the sustainability of 
the 
economic reform efforts and EU accession ambitions of f y R Macedonia. P o l i t i c a l i n s t a b i l i t y 

and unce r ta in ty in the region, mainly related t o the reso lu t ion o f the K o s o v o status, affects the 
investment c l ima te in f Y R Macedon ia and adverse developments in the r e g i o n c o u l d spill over t o 
fYR Macedonia, as was the case w i th the K o s o v o c r i s i s in 1999. T h e p o l i t i c a l consensus in the 
coun t ry o n fos te r ing peace fu l cooperation with i t s neighbors and strong consent and cooperation 
with the in te rna t iona l organizations are impo r tan t p recond i t ions f o r successful management o f 
such r i s k s . The p r e v a i l i n g p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t across the r e g i o n t ow a r d EU in teg ra t ion w i l l 
further s e r v e to m i t iga te p o l i t i c a l r i s k s . The many in i t ia t ives t o encourage fu r the r reg iona l 
integration, such as CEFTA , shou ld help m i t iga te these r i s k s as well. The B a n k w i l l m o n i t o r 
reg iona l developments c lose ly and make necessary adjustments t o the support strategy if 
warranted. 

13 1. Domestic political developments also pose a risk to the implementation of the reform 

p rog ram . P o l i t i c a l divergence between the va r ious ethnic parties can cause a s l ow d ow n o f 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the r e f o rm p rog ram that w i l l be supported by this CPS, and can de lay c r i t i c a l 
reforms necessary f o r EU in teg ra t ion as w e l l . Second, the government i s composed o f a 
coa l i t ion that includes several smaller parties. Regroupings within the c o a l i t i o n are possible, 
which in turn, may limit the government’s a b i l i t y t o pursue necessary far-reaching re fo rms that 

43 

Country Partnership Strategy f o r j Y R Macedon ia FY07-10 

may require qua l i f ied ma jo r i t ies in Parliament. F l e x i b i l i t y in t h e CPS p r o g r am w i l l enable the 
Bank to adjust i t s support strategy shou ld the p o l i t i c a l cond i t ions warrant. 

132. A delay in EU membership could result in political tu rmo i l that could adversely impact 
the implementation of 
the reform program. The EU accession process, a top p r i o r i t y fo r a l l 
p o l i t i c a l parties and s t rong ly supported by the popu la t ion at large, i s a s t rong incen t ive t o achieve 
consensus fo r key s t ruc tu ra l and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms . This strategic d i rec t ion helps focus the 
government efforts o n c r i t i c a l reforms, especially those i d e n t i f i e d in the E C Progress Reports. 
Also, strengthening ins t i tu t iona l capacity t o ensu re e f fec t ive abso rp t ion o f EU funds i s an 
impo r tan t incen t ive f o r con t inu ing progress in this area. These incen t ives w i l l become weaker i f 
progress o n the road t o Eu rope w o u l d s low down . The E C c lose ly m o n i t o r s progress o n re fo rms 
regularly, and the m o n i t o r i n g o f the Bank’s p rog ram can also help i d e n t i f y areas that require 
additional efforts to address this risk t o the B a n k p rog ram . 

Ix . CONCLUDING R EMARK S 

133 . FYR Macedon ia has made an impressive leap f r o m a pos t -con f l ic t coun t ry t o an EU 
candidate coun t ry in o n l y fou r years, preserving i t s macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , w h i c h bodes we l l 
fo r the outcome o f the ove ra l l r e f o rm p rog ram during the CPS p e r i o d and building the l e v e l o f 
confidence essential t o fos te r ing g r ow t h and investment. FYR Macedon ia needs t o accelerate 
and sustain the economic g r ow t h f o r the bene f i t o f a l l citizens, while inc reas ing the e f f ic iency 
and transparency o f the p u b l i c services. The B a n k w i l l con t inue t o b e a s t rong partner with fYR 
Macedonia as i t faces these challenges in the c om i n g fou r years and i s c omm i t t e d to helping the 
government t o achieve the r e s u l t s described in this CPS. A m i d - t e rm r e v i ew o f the CPS (CPSPR 
in FY 0 9 ) w o u l d take stock o f progress towards ach iev ing the CPS outcomes and r e s u l t s and 
propose appropriate adjustments t o the support strategy f o r F Y 0 9 - F Y 10.

Date o f Completion Report: February 2007 
Period Covered by the CAS: July 2003-June 2006 
Prepared by: Andrew Kircher 

A. C O N T E X T OF THE CAS04 

From Post-Conflict Country to EU Candidate 

1. 
The fo rme r Yugos lav Repub l ic o f Macedon ia (FYR Macedonia)’s progress f r o m a post- 
con f l ic t country t o an EU candidate in the space o f the 2004-2006 C A S has been impressive. 
When the CAS 0 4 was app roved in September 2003, f Y R Macedon ia was s t i l l recove r ing from 
the economic; p o l i t i c a l and soc ia l fa l lou t o f the 2001 con f l ic t . Today in 2007, N R Macedon ia i s 
en joy ing EU candidate status, a lbe i t w i thou t a clear date t o start t h e negotiations, making i t the 
t h i r d coun t ry t o emerge f r o m the fo rme r Yugos lav ia t o become a candidate, after S loven ia 
(already a member since 2004) and Croatia. O n the p o l i t i c a l front, successive governments in 
N R Macedon ia have made considerable e f fo r ts t o imp lemen t the Ohrid F ramewo rk Agreement, 
w h i c h p rov ided the basis f o r reso lv ing the 2001 e thn ic con f l ic t . 

2 . 
O n the economic front, the Macedon ian government has been pursuing an ambitious 
re fo rm p rog ram and has successfully p rese rved macro-economic s tab i l i ty during the past few 
years, though i t s g r ow t h performance has n o t been s t e l l a r , especially by reg iona l standards. 
F o l l ow i n g the p ro longed con t rac t ion o f the ea r ly 1990s and s tab i l iza t ion in the mid-l990s, 
g row th began t o p i c k up in the pe r iod o f 1998-2000, but was disrupted by the 2001 con f l ic t . 
G r ow t h averaged a round 0.3 % in the pe r iod 2000-2002 and has accelerated t o around 3.5% in 
the 2003-2005 p e r i o d m o s t l y d r iven by im p r o v e d trade pe r fo rmance and modest p ick -up in 

investment activity. This t o o k a heavy t o l l o n l iv ing standards as t h e unemplofment ra te 

( t rad i t iona l ly at very high leve ls ) , increased f r o m around 30% in 2000 t o 38% by 2002. L a b o r 

market data ind ica te that most o f the g r ow t h has come f r o m productivity gains as the 

unemployment ra te remains at around 36.5% at end-2005. 

3. 
The f isca l adjustment during this pe r iod was remarkable, with la rge imbalances o f 2001- 
2002 o f -6.3 and -5.6 percent o f GDP respectively being reduced t o 0 . 1 percent o f GD P f isca l 
d e f i c i t in 2003, and surpluses o f 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent o f G D P in 2004 and 2005 
respectively. The cen t ra l budget de f ic i t i s expected t o average 0.6 percent o f G D P in 2006, 
ensuring that government spending and p u b l i c debt con t inue o n a d ow nw a r d p a t h (as % o f GDP). 
The prudent f isca l p o l i c y enabled a slight loosen ing o f the mone ta ry po l icy , resu l t ing in 
dec l in ing interest rates16 and expanding c red i t t o the p r iva te sector17 w i t h o u t comp rom is ing p r ice

been o n concessional IDA terms. But because o f improved econom ic performance and 
creditworthiness, fYR Macedon ia graduated fully f rom IDA in 2003.

During the three years o f the W o r l d Bank ’s Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) f o r fYR

The CAS 0 4 C om p l e t i o n Repo r t concludes that the Bank ’s assistance t o f Y R Macedon ia 
through F Y 0 4 - F Y 0 6 was Satisfactory. The report evaluates the impac t and e f fec t iveness o f the

The analysis o f fYR Macedonia’s development challenges in the CAS 0 4 were developed

the e f f ic ien t management o f p u b l i c resources and tack le co r rup t ion ; (ii) t o promote the creation 

o f jobs through sustainable p r iva te sector driven growth; and (iii) to promote soc ia l cohesion, 

build human capital, and p ro tec t the mos t vulnerable. ’ 

B. RETROFITTING THE RESULTS FRAMEWORK 

Objective I: Promoting the efficient management o f public resources and tackling 
corruption. 

12. During the CAS04, the government strengthened the management o f p u b l i c resources and 
the fight against co r rup t ion . The Bank ’s focus o n this pillar was in large pa r t an outcome o f the 
Country F inanc ia l Accountability Assessment that l o o k e d at the des ign and imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the p u b l i c f inanc ia l management f ramewo rk and evaluated the f ramewo rk ’s a b i l i t y to ensure the 
proper use o f the coun t ry ’s o w n resources and those p r o v i d e d by the Bank and other donors. In 
particular, i t recommended r e f o rm in the f i v e Extra-Budgetary Funds (EBFs), i n c l u d i n g the 
Hea l th Insurance Fund, the Pens ion and Disability Insurance Fund, the A g r i c u l t u r e Fund, the 
Road Fund, and the Em p l o ym e n t Fund. 

13 . 
Program rating: Progress o n p u b l i c resource management and co r rup t ion i s ra ted as 
Satisfactory. Outcomes have va r ied across the agenda. 

14. 
Outcome 1 : Pub l ic expenditure management has improved, but much remains to be 
done. The Bank’s support o f the p u b l i c sector management r e f o rm p r o g r am came in t h r e e 
successive p o l i c y lending instruments, i n c l u d i n g the Pub l ic Sector Managemen t Adjustment 
Credit (PSMAC ) , f o l l ow e d by the Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan ( P S M A L I I ) 
and the F i rs t Programmatic Development Policy Loan (PDPL). The la t te r l o a n i s pa r t o f a 
three-year P D P L p r o g r am a im i n g at supporting the coun t ry ’s s t ruc tu ra l re fo rm p rog ram to 
p romo te economic g r ow t h and j o b creation th rough im p r o v i n g the investment c l ima te and 
strengthening the governance and e f f ic iency o f the p u b l i c sectors. This program w i l l con t inue t o 
s e r v e as the centerpiece o f the Country Partnership Strategy 2007 -2010 (hereafter re fe r red to as 
CPSO 7). 

15 . 
As ind ica ted before, a c r i t i c a l weakness i d e n t i f i e d in the C A S 0 4 was the five EBFs, 
w h i c h together comp r ised some 40 percent o f to ta l government spending, and w h i c h operated 
outside o f the cen t ra l government budget and the treasury and with weak ove rs igh t and f inanc ia l 
controls. The EBFs h a d been a m a j o r oppo r tun i ty f o r co r rup t ion and m isuse o f p u b l i c resources. 
Under the P S M A L II, fou r EBFs were b rough t under con t ro l and in teg ra ted in to w i th the single 
treasury account, while the fifth one (the ag r icu l tu ra l fund) was abolished. At the same time, the

were approved fo r i n d i v i d u a l l i n e ministries, the government im p r o v e d budget execution, and the 
parliament enacted n ew laws o n in te rna l audit, public procurement and c i v i l servants.

16. 
Outcome 2: The civil service and broader public sector employment structures have 
started their way on reform. In the CAS04 , the uncon t ro l led g r ow t h o f the public wage b i l l was 
found t o b e a m a j o r risk t o f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty in fYR Macedonia. In the con tex t o f the PSMAC , 
Parliament enacted a new L a w o n C i v i l Servants that inc luded a u n i f o rm , rule-based and l e s s 
compressed salary structure f o r a l l c i v i l servants, u n i f o rm de f in i t ions o f t h e types o f pos i t ions in 
the c i v i l service, compe t i t ive and transparent rec ru i tmen t procedures, and establishment o f an 
independent agency. A f t e r extensive consultations with the Bank, the IMF, and the government, 
actual imp lemen ta t ion o f the wage decompression p rov is ions o f this l a w were o n l y enacted in 
April 2004, and i t s 24 -mon th imp lemen ta t ion schedule has just been concluded. 
The 
decompression f o l l ow e d a six-year p e r i o d when c i v i l servant p a y was frozen. I t i s n o w serving 
as a catalyst f o r decompression in other areas o f the p u b l i c administration, i n c l u d i n g p a y r e f o rm 
in education, the p o l i c e and the jud ic ia ry , among others. P D P L l then con t inued t o support c i v i l 
service re fo rms including fu r the r changes t o the leg is la t ive f ramewo rk and the development o f 
comprehensive m o n i t o r i n g ind ica to rs and targets t o ensu re the sustained imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
re fo rms . 

17. 
Outcome 3: Th e government has moved on regarding inappropriate public sector 
interventions in business but needs more action on business environment. M o s t State and 
Soc ia l ly Owned Enterprises were p r iva t ized during the m id -1990s but the e f fo r t s t i l l l e f t some 
large SOEs to be restructured o r l iqu ida ted at the beginning o f the C A S 0 4 pe r iod . The Second 
F inanc ia l and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL ) , w h i c h c losed la te 2004, 
successfully supported the government’s e f fo r ts in selling o f f o r l i q u i d a t i n g about 100 o f these 
remaining SOEs, focus ing o n the largest loss-makers with substantial arrears to the government. 
Comme rc ia l bank lending increased as a percentage o f GD P f r o m 12-13 percent f o r 1998-2002 
t o around 24 percent o f GDP by end-2005, while deposits increased f r o m the equ iva len t o f an 
average o f 22 percent o f GD P during that time to 33 percent in 2005. State owne rsh ip o f the 
bank ing sector declined f r o m an average o f about 15 percent o f to ta l assets f o r 2000-2002 t o 
about 9 percent in 2005. B a n k lending t o the p r iva te sector increased f r o m 14 t o 2 1 percent o f 
GDP f r om 2001 to 2005. 

18. 
Closures o f SOEs caused a substantial increase in the number o f unemployed. T o tackle 
this, the government and the B a n k deve loped and imp lemen ted the Social Support Project. The

Pub l ic owne rsh ip i s n o longe r a serious constraint t o p r iva te sector performance in fYR 
Macedonia. In 2002, the government learned the lesson o f the p rope r sequencing o f p r iva t iza t ion 
when the telecom p r i v a t i z a t i o n was ca r r ied out w i t h o u t a regu la to ry f ramewo rk in p lace . The 
successful p r iva t iza t ion o f the D i s t r i b u t i o n part o f ESM (the p ow e r utility company) in the spring 
o f 2006 shows h o w the government’s strategy o f putting in p lace the p rope r f ramewo rk be fo re 
p r iva t iza t ion has p a i d o f f . With the ESM -D i s t r i b u t i o n p r iva t iza t ion , the government n o w has the 
institutional, regulatory, and adm in is t ra t ive f ramewo rk that enables the e lec t r ic i ty market t o 
operate f r e e f r o m p r iva te ma rke t p ow e r and undue government in te rven t ions . T o support this 

concept further, Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening Project 

(BER IS ) aims t o help the government’s e f fo r ts t o s t imu la te econom ic g r ow t h based o n increased 
domestic and fo re ign inves tmen t by strengthening p u b l i c sector capac i ty t o im p r o v e selected 
areas o f the bus iness env i ronmen t and increase competitiveness o f the business sector. 

In 

particular, the BERIS w i l l assist the government in implementing the Eu ropean Partnership (EP) 
signed between the E C and the government in June 2004, by addressing m a n y o f the priority 

areas iden t i f ied by the EP. The B ER I S benefited f r om very close coope ra t ion with USAID and 
EAR. 

20. 
The f i r s t p i l l a r o f the P D P L p rog ram focuses o n i m p r o v i n g the investment c l ima te 
through supporting s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms in the jud ic ia ry , labo r market, f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion and 
corporate governance, as we l l as o n the regu la to ry environment f o r the p r iva te sector. 

Outcome 4: Decentralization has proceeded with government commitment. 

2 1. 
Decentralization, which i s an impo r tan t element o f the p u b l i c sector r e f o rm pillar o f the PDPL1 , 
i s a central tene t o f the Ohrid Peace Agreement, w h i c h se t ou t spec i f ic re fo rms and protections

mandates the phased decen t ra l iza t ion o f the respons ib i l i ty o f many gove rnmen t func t ions t o the 
mun ic ipa l i t ies . 
In N o v em b e r 2004, a referendum a imed at b l o c k i n g 
decentralization process was defeated at the po l ls . Because o f i t s cen t ra l i ty t o the O h r i d

In ESW, the Bank ’s U rban Policy Note in 2004 highlighted the challenges o f u rban

Outcome 5: 

Transportation has improved and operations have been made more 

efficient. The CAS04 ind ica ted that imp rovemen ts in the transport sector were essential f o r 
reg iona l in teg ra t ion and growth, and res t ruc tu r ing was necessary f o r comp l iance w i th EU

FYR Macedon ia i s also one o f the bene f ic ia ry countries unde r MIGA’s European

Satisfactory given the challenges in fYR Macedon ia but m u c h m o r e w o r k needs t o be done. 

29. 
Outcome 1: Improve the business climate to allow private sector-led growth. With most 
o f the reg iona l con f l ic ts being resolved, structural impediments are a k e y cons t ra in t t o g r ow t h 
and employment. The Bank’s Do ing Business 2006 repo r t and the series o f BEEPS surveys

highlights s low and cos t ly enforcement o f contracts, 
res t r ic t ive bank rup tcy procedures, 
regulatory imped imen ts and delays, and an inflexible labo r ma rke t as pa r t icu la r concerns . FYR 
Macedonia, as with many countries in the region, also suffers f r om an opaque corporate 
governance s t ruc tu re . The government i s comm i t ted t o addressing these i s s u e s w i th B a n k

program, as we l l as capac i ty building and investments p r o v i d e d under the B E R I S , the Real 
Estate and L and Registration Project, and the Lega l and Judicial Implementation and 
Institutional Support Project app roved in May, 2006. F o r i t s part, the TTFSE contributed to 
decreasing the economic distance t o markets by reduc ing n o n - t a r i f f barriers t o trade. O n a mo re 
longer-term footing, the coun t ry needs t o upgrade the q u a l i f i c a t i o n o f i t s labo r force that 
s ign i f ican t ly limits the g r ow t h prospects o f the economy. 

30. Meanwhile, the C A S 0 4 end -FY06 target o f t w o p r iva te sector p ro jec ts in infrastructure 
has been me t . In the energy sector, hydro-plants we re given unde r concession to a private 
operator, and the cons t ruc t ion o f the Skopje Comb ined H e a t h and Powe r P lan t i s p lanned as a 
PPP and the e lec t r ic i ty d is t r ibu t ion ne two rk was recen t ly p r iva t ized . In telecommunications, 
b o t h GSM service p rov ide rs are p r iva te . Howeve r , delays in the establishment o f the regu la to ry 
f ramewo rk in va r ious sectors have prevented more dynam ic p r iva te sector en t ry in infrastructure. 

31. 
Outcome 2: Th e f inanc ia l sector is more sound but problems remain. 
Be fo re the 
CAS04 period, the government saw the need to r e f o rm the f inanc ia l and enterprise sectors with 
the a im o f speeding up p r iva te sector g row th . The B a n k supported that ob jec t ive th rough the 
Second F inanc ia l and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan ( F E SA L ) , w h i c h he lped p rov ide the 
f ramewo rk f o r faster p r iva te sector g r ow t h and j o b creation, supported by a hea l th ie r and mo re 
developed f inanc ia l system. The p ro jec t was designed and implemented in an environment o f 
p o l i t i c a l t u rm o i l and economic d is rup t ion caused by the Kosovo c r is is o f 1999. By the project’s 
end, fYR Macedon ia h a d made substantial progress in enhancing the ove ra l l soundness o f the 
f inanc ia l system, p a r t i c u l a r l y the banking sector. The largest o f the loss -mak ing enterprises that 
crowded out new p r i v a t e sector growth h a d been reso lved while changes in the bus iness 
environment have r em o v e d m a j o r obstacles f o r private sector entry and have con t r ibu ted t o 
strengthening o f the c red i to rs ’ and shareholders’ rights. S t i l l , a number o f deficiencies and deep 
systemic problems in t h e j u d i c i a l sector have unde rm ined the success ‘ o f the r e f o rm s in the 
f inanc ia l and enterprise sectors.

updated the 2001 corporate governance ROSC and assessed the corporate governance p o l i c y 
framework, as w e l l as enforcement and comp l iance practices. The repo r t found that fYR 
Macedonia i s in the f i n a l stages o f an intense p e r i o d o f corporate governance r e f o rm with recen t 
reforms resulting in a fkamework that has im p r o v e d comp l iance with m a n y O E C D p r inc ip les . 
But the ROSC also recommended severa l changes, including ove rhau l ing the disclosure 
f ramewo rk and comp le t ion o f the corporate governance code. A lso , a F inanc ia l Sector 
Assessment in November 2003 found that fYR Macedonia’s f inanc ia l system was ve ry sma l l and 
that the development showed the ma rks o f the coun t ry ’s f i rs t decade o f independence. 
None the less , the soundness o f the banking system has been im p r o v i n g in r e c e n t years. The last 
t h r e e years saw a so l id expansion o f the f inanc ia l sector ac t iv i t ies in the coun t ry . Though s t i l l 
re la t ive ly sha l low in in te rna t iona l and reg iona l comparisons, the entry o f the f ew fo re ign banks 
created modest compe t i t ive p ressu re resulting in a reduc t ion in comme rc ia l banks’ in te res t rates. 
The weighted lending rates f e l l from close t o 18 percent in la te 2002 t o around 1 1 percen t at the 
beginning o f 2006, while fu r the r cuts are expected i f current economic trends continue.

area f i r s t with a study o n lega l and j u d i c i a l re fo rm , w h i c h i d e n t i f i e d fYR Macedon ia ’s ine f f ic ien t 
and ineffective system as a m a j o r constraint t o the fu r the r development o f a market economy, 
economic growth, and the expansion o f the p r iva te and f inanc ia l sectors. The study, Imp rov ing 
the Business Climate in JYR Macedonia: A Lega l and Judicial Enforcement Assessment, 
re leased in June 2005, found that as a key component in f Y R Macedon ia ’s investment climate, 
the i n e f f e c t i v e lega l and j u d i c i a l system n o t o n l y hinders the functioning o f ex is t ing bus inesses , 
but i t also creates obstacles t o the d e f i n i t i o n and enforcement o f creditor, contract and p rope r ty 
rights. In M a y 2006, the Bank ’s boa rd app roved the Lega l and Judicial Implementation and 
Institutional Support Project t o ass is t the government further in this area, w h i c h i s in add i t ion t o 
key p o l i c y measures in j u d i c i a l r e f o rm inc luded in the PDP L . 
Government o f fYR Macedon ia in enhancing government capacity and building ins t i tu t ions

generating capacity, th rough the p r o v i s i o n o f equipment and techn ica l assistance and the 
carrying out o f wo rks . This progress, w h i c h was supported by the Power System Improvement

hyd ropowe r plants are loca ted due to an i n f l u x o f Kosova r refugees f o l l o w i n g c i v i l disturbances. 
M o r e capacity and generation were achieved than forecast, with the ac tua l add i t iona l capacity o f 
49 M w exceeding the p ro jec t target o f 3 1 Mw . And the im p r o v e d e f f i c i e n c y has increased the 
number o f hours pe r year that the plants are in operation and reduced t h e number o f unplanned

In Ju ly 2004, t h e Bank drafted proposals in the FYR Macedon ia Energy Policy Paper, 

37. 
w h i c h examined f Y R Macedonia’s progress in energy sector re fo rm , p a r t i c u l a r l y through the 
adoption o f an Energy Law and establishment o f an independent energy regu la to r . N o w that the 
new energy l aw has been adopted in M a r c h 2006, a new m e d i um t e r m energy strategy w i l l need 
to be drafted and the B a n k has already b e e n requested t o assist unde r the CPSO7. Meanwh i le , a 
GEF energy e f f ic iency p ro jec t has been approved by the B o a r d in December, 2006. In the area 
o f renewable and env i ronmen ta l ly f r i e n d l y sources o f energy, the gove rnmen t has implemented a

attracting s ign i f ican t a t ten t ion f r o m p r iva te investors. 

38. 
At the same time, f Y R Macedon ia and other SEE countries have acknowledged that 
solutions to reg iona l energy i s s u e s requ i re reg iona l solutions. 
In Decembe r 2003, fYR 
Macedonia joined the other countries in SEE in signing the “Athens Memo randum , ” which 
comm i t ted the countries t o a reg iona l approach to energy and t o in teg ra t ion i n t o the European 
Commun i ty In te rna l Energy M a r k e t . The needs f o r inves tmen t in the energy sector are mo re 
than the pub l ic sector can p r o v i d e so re fo rms a re needed t o bring in the p r iva te sector t o develop 
capacity. FYR Macedon ia ’s successful p r iva t iza t ion o f the E S M utility in the spring o f 2006 
shows h o w the government has made strides in open ing up the sector t o p r iva te funds. 
January 2006, the B a n k re in fo rced fYR Macedonia’s re fo rms with the ECSEE Adaptable 
Program Loan that supports fYR Macedonia’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in the E n e r g y C omm u n i t y o f South

seeks to reduce non - ta r i f f costs t o trade and transport, and t o prevent smuggling and co r rup t ion at 
border crossings. Since the p ro jec t became e f fec t ive in 2001, fYR Macedon ia has s e e n increases 
and exceeded i t s targets in the va lue o f impo r ts and revenue collected, s ign i f ican t reductions in

Outcome 6: Support to SMEs must continue. T h r o u g h several d i f fe ren t programs, the 
I F C has supported Sma l l and Med ium Enterprise (SME ) development in fYR Macedonia. A 
three-year p ro jec t funded by Aus t r ia i s focused o n the secondary ma te r ia l r e c y c l i n g industry in

49. 
Outcome 1: Th e maintenance of social cohesion is improving. Bank support fo r social 
cohesion and c omm u n i t y development took the f o rm o f three d i f fe ren t but s im i la r projects that 
a l l produced satisfactory outcomes and a l l were supported by g r a n t s f r o m the D u t c h government. 
First, the Community Development Project aimed t o foster reconc i l ia t ion among the people, 
reduce social tensions, and build l o c a l social capital. The p ro jec t has made progress towa rd that 
goal by piloting small-scale c omm u n i t y based initiatives in selected demons t ra t ion communities 
under an integrated development f ramewo rk designed to respond t o p r i o r i t y soc ia l needs and

have used or are using grants to carry ou t se l f-eva lua t ions and development p lans while a l l other 

p r ima ry and secondary schools are scheduled t o take pa r t in the p rog ram . Techn ica l assistance 
fo r teacher t ra in ing has a r r ived and i s n o w active o n the ground. Progress, meanwhile, o n 
im p r o v i n g equ i ty and e f f ic iency f o r a decentralized education system has been slower. The 
building o f capac i ty o f the mun ic ipa l i t ies was de l ibe ra te ly delayed t o ensu re p rope r linkages t o 
other dono r - funded ac t iv i t ies . 
I t shou ld be no ted that the p ro jec t benefited f r o m extensive 
support and cooperation f r o m the D u t c h b i la te ra l development agency. 

Outcome 3: Hea l th outcomes have improved. In April 2004, the I C R o f the Bank ’s 

53. 
Hea l th Sector Transition Project found progress o n f inanc ing o f the hea l th system h a d run i n t o

popu la t ion by enhancing the q u a l i t y o f basic hea l th services, with a 48 percent reduction in infant 
m o r t a l i t y ( f r om 22.7 in 1995 t o 11.8 in 2000); a 37 percent d rop in ma te rna l mo r ta l i ty , (from 
21.8 in 1995 t o 13.7 in 2000), and a 15 percent f a l l in tuberculosis inc idence ( f r om 4 0 in 1995 t o 
34.1 in 2001). I t also supported an i n i t i a l phase o f p o l i c y re fo rms t o increase cost effectiveness, 

f isca l sustainability and pa t ien t choice within the health system. T h e average length o f stay in 

hospitals was decreased by 2 0 percent f r o m 14.3 t o 11.4 days, while t h e number o f consultations 
per physician in outpatient care was increased by 18 pe rcen t . 

54. 
The second hea l th project, the Hea l th Sector Management Project, set ou t t o address the 
i s s u e o f cost-containment w h i l e im p r o v i n g q u a l i t y and access. A l t h o u g h the p ro jec t i s s t i l l 
under imp lemen ta t ion , i t has he lped fYR Macedon ia t o achieve some key resu l ts , i n c l u d i n g

Progress o n t h e ob jec t ive o f 
im p r o v i n g the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f the soc ia l p ro tec t ion system has been satisfactory. 
In particular, the B a n k has supported the government’s e f fo r ts to build a sound and f isca l ly

budgetary a l loca t ion f o r f inanc ing the pens ion r e f o rm t rans i t ion in the 2006 budget. 

Outcome 5: Measu r ing of Poverty i s Improving. During the last th ree years, the State 

56. 
Statistics O f f i c e (SSO) made considerable progress in im p r o v e d ca lcu la t ion and dissemination o f

was expanded t o better understand non - income aspects o f p o v e r t y (modules o n access to health, 
education and social services we re added t o the HBS), regular p o v e r t y p r o f i l e reports were 
expanded and are publicly ava i lab le o n the government’s website. The ins t i tu t iona l capacity

that demands made by the EU accession process w i l l reduce the SSO ’s a t ten t ion t o this area. 
Earlier, the B a n k teamed with the SSO o f fYR Macedon ia t o p roduce the FYR Macedonia 
Poverty Assessment for 2002-2003 t o imp rove understanding o f the p o v e r t y s i tua t ion in the

Th e sh i f i in focus in the B an k ’ program over the 2003-2006 CAS per iod from pub l ic 
sector reform to p r iva te sector development issues was timely and appropriate, and should 

continue. Be tween 2002 and 2006, fYR Macedon ia regained s t rong mac ro d isc ip l ine and 
transformed f r o m a pos t -con f l ic t coun t ry t o an EU candidate. In response, the Bank shifted i t s

p rog ram appropriately t o deal m o r e d i rec t ly with economic g r ow t h constraints. This should 
continue in the nex t CPS. 

6 8 . 
The Bank needs to increase its focus on j YR Macedonia’s integration with the EU. 
EU accession i s a top p r i o r i t y f o r fYR Macedonia, and the Bank needs t o assist the coun t ry in 
meeting the accession c r i t e r i a and the EU acquis, i n c l u d i n g o n building the ins t i tu t iona l capacity 

to e f f e c t i v e l y implement EU regulations. 

6 9 . 
The EU accession process has major implications on budget allocation and priorities. 
The Bank’s funding c o u l d se rve as c r i t i c a l bridge f inanc ing t o enable fYR Macedon ia t o access 
EU pre-accession funds. The n ew P ER slated f o r delivery in F Y 0 7 shou ld analyze and provide 
recommendations t o the Macedon ian government o n the f isca l p o l i c y cha l lenges the coun t ry 
faces in the run-up t o EU accession. 

7 0 . 
Stronger economic growth and j o b creation must be achieved. In order t o ma in ta in 
popu la r support f o r the r e f o rm agenda, there i s a need f o r fYR Macedon ia t o show that i t s 
successful mac ro economic d isc ip l ine and structural r e f o rm in i t ia t ives do translate i n t o stronger 
growth, j o b creation and imp rovemen t o f living standards f o r a l l . 

7 1. 
FYR Macedonia’s competitiveness needs attention and role of education reform needs 
to increase. I f Macedon ian companies are t o compete in the reg iona l and in te rna t iona l markets, 
their competitiveness needs t o imp rove . Such a stronger compe t i t ive edge also r e q u i r e s a better 
ma tch b e tw e e n the q u a l i t y o f education in fYR Macedon ia with the needs o f the 21St Cen tu ry and 
the know ledge economy. 

72. 
The mu l t iyea r Policy Development Program has served the Bank ’sp rog ram well. The 
ongo ing three-year PDPL p rog ram helped in shift o f p o l i c y p r io r i t ies , has been well connected to 
a number o f investment projects, and helped secure con t inu i ty and p r e d i c t a b i l i t y in the r e f o rm 
p rog ram . I t even helped in the t rans i t ion p e r i o d f o l l ow i n g the recent gove rnmen t change, as the 
already agreed u p o n PDPL p o l i c y f ramewo rk and related cond i t iona l i ty , p l a y e d an ins t rumen ta l 
r o l e in the con t inua t ion o f specific r e f o rm e f fo r ts . 

7 3 . 
Decentralization is critical to ensuring the peace and reforms. Decen t ra l iza t ion i s a k e y 
pa r t o f the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Ohrid Peace Agreement. Key f o r i t s success w i l l be that l o c a l 
communities are able t o fully t a k e pa r t in the country’s development. T h e challenge f o r the

T h e CFAA proposed the abolishment o f one o f the funds (the 
Agriculture Fund) and 
introduction o f more stringent 
enhanced controls over the remaining four funds. 
T h e authorities made considerable progress in this field. T h e 
Agricultural Fund was abolished during 2004. At the same 
time, the remaining funds were forbidden to incur debt and as 
o f January 1, 2005 they a l l operate through the STA. 
Currently, all revenues and expenditures o f the EBFs (with 
the exception o f some foreign financed expenditures o f the 
Road Fund) are being processed through the STA. 
T h e Ministry o f Finance has precise and timely reporting on 
the balances o f the accounts o f the EBFs though s t i l l has 
limited influence over actual spending decisions o f EBFs. 
Namely, in order to allow for the specificities o f the four 
EBFs, the Treasury does not execute the same level o f 
controls over the transactions o f the funds. 
T h i s 
i s partly being overcome by the requirement for 
establishing the internal audit functions i n the EBFs and 
further strengthening o f f inanc ia l controls (appointment o f 
MoF representative w i th a veto power at the H IF Board). 

S i n c e its establishment in 1999, the S A 0 has been expanding 
the scope o f its activities, thus preventing a direct comparison 
between the baseline indicator and the targeted one. 
T h e Audit universe o f the SA 0 in 2005 was 2,043 institutions 
compared to 1,740 in 2002. 
However, the progress achieved in terms o f improved audit 
coverage o f public funds i s notable. 
In 2004, the SA 0 audited 113 institutions (5.5% o f 2004 
Audit universe) and prepared 190 Audit Reports compared to 
85 institutions in 2002 (4.9% o f 2002 Audit universe) with 99 
Audit Reports. 
T h e coverage in terms o f public funds audited i s significantly 
larger. 
T h e 2004 Audit Reports covered 42% o f the expenditures o f 
narrowly defined Central Government (Ministries and f i r s t - 
l i n e Budget users), 67% o f the expenditures o f the EBFs and 
40% o f the expenditures o f the local government units.

sector activities in the country. 
Though still relatively shallow i n international and regional 
comparisons, the entry o f the few foreign banks did create 
modest competitive pressure resulting in a reduction in 
commercial banks’ interest ra tes . 
W h i l e exact comparison o f interest rate spreads i s no t possible 
due to methodological breaks in calculation o f weighted rates, 
indicative data show a reduction in the spread from 8.5 p.p. at 
end-2002 to around 6.5 p.p. at the beginning o f 2006. 
M o r e importantly, this reduction was accompanied by a 
simultaneous overall reduction in the ra tes . T h e weighted 
lending rates f e l l from c lose t o 1 8% p.a. i n late-2002 to 
around 11% p.a. at the beginning o f 2006. 
Further rate cuts are expected i f the current economic trends 
continue and the announced entry o f few reputable foreign 
banks materializes. 

Achieved 

T h e end-FY06 target o f two private sec to r projects i n 
infrastructure has been met. 
In the energy sector, hydro-plants were given under 
concession to a private operator; the construction o f the 
Skopje CHPP i s planned as a PPP and just recently the 
electricity distribution network was privatized. 
I n the telecommunications, both GSM service providers are 
private. 
However, delays in the establishing o f the regulatory 
framework in various sectors have prevented more dynamic 
private sector entry i n infrastructure. 
T h e adoption o f the legal framework for introduction o f 
competition in fixed-line phone services has been prolonged 
extensively and i t seems that the regulatory bodies are not 
exercising sufficient pressures for earlier abolition o f the 
monopoly in this sector. 
T h e railways reform process has only recently begun, the 
ownership o f the gas pipeline has been subject to court 
disputes fo r a prolonged period while the framework for 
giving the two airports under concessions remains unclear. 

in 

During the last three years, the State Statistics Office made 
considerable progress 
improved calculation and 
dissemination o f poverty data. 
T h e data collection method was significantly improved, 
regular poverty profile reports were expanded and are 
publicly available on the web-site o f the S S M and in 2005, i n 
a jo in t effort with the World Bank, the first ever absolute 
poverty figures for the country were published. 
T h e SSO has given assurance that i t w i l l continue to improve 
i t s procedures and that i t w i l l include the absolute poverty 
calculations in i t s regular work plan. 
However, l e s s progress was made in the public access to 
actual micro-level datasets. A WB s t a f f review o f the 
legislation i n 2003 revealed that there are no major obstacles 
to sharing individual level data fo r research purposes 
(provided a l l identifying characteristics are removed), the 
introduction o f some new 
legislation may warrant a 
reassessment.

What didn’t work we l l? 
During FY04-06, I F C made n o d i rec t investments in fYR Macedon ia . The absence o f I F C 
investment projects in the C A S p e r i o d was the outcome o f several u n s u c c e s s h l attempts t o 
generate investment business in the coun t ry . FYR Macedonia’s business c l ima te was n o t 
conducive to private investment, as r e f l e c t e d in the country’s low D o i n g Business indicators, and 
pa r t icu la r ly deterred FDI. At the same time, the mass p r iva t iza t ion m o d e l tha t fYR Macedon ia 
fo l lowed resulted in either widely dispersed ownership, where n ew owne rs adopted a ren t -

did no t mee t w i t h the government’s interest o r support. Cons ide r ing that I F C h a d already made 
investments in fYR Macedonia’s tw o mos t prominent l o c a l banks p r i o r t o the C A S period, there 
was l i t t l e oppo r tun i ty t o d o m o r e in the bank ing sector. I F C a t temp ted t o pursue a leas ing p ro jec t 

but i t did not come t o f ru i t ion . 

However, I F C inves ted in fou r reg iona l projects suppo r t ing coun t r ies in Southern Europe region, 
inc lud ing in f Y R Macedon ia :

Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CPS. In te rna l ly , the who le country 

team has been ac t ive ly i n v o l v e d in the preparation o f the strategy i n c l u d i n g I F C and MIGA 

members o f the team . E a r l y consultations begun in November 2005, when the members o f the 

coun t ry team got together f o r two day retreat in fYR Macedon ia and, j o i n t l y with the then

Consultations with the political opposition on the CPS program took place in the f i rs t half of 

2006. With the pa r l iamen ta ry elections concluded in July 2006, these consultations were c r i t ica l 
t o ensure that the support p rog ram i s focused o n na t iona l p r io r i t ies and has the support o f a l l 
stakeholders. Despite the differences in party platforms during t h e e lec t ion campaign, the

I n jYR Macedonia, the Country Office has embarked on focused consultations with 

stakeholders. The t e am started the consu l ta t ion process by p repa ra t ion and comp le t ion o f a 
C l ien t Survey in M a y 2006. Some 270 stakeholders f r o m government, pa r l iamen t , c i v i l society, 
private sector, med ia and academic ins t i tu t ions responded to the questionnaire. The r e s u l t s

delivering the support. D r a f t CPS was presented th rough a separate sec t ion o n the Coun t ry 
O f f i c e web s i te , w h i c h has been established t o ensure wider pa r t ic ipa t ion o f a l l stakeholders in 
the CPS preparation. 

The Deputy P r ime M in is te r for Economic Affairs formed a CPS government counterpart team 
to guide the preparation of 

the strategy. The B a n k and the gove rnmen t teams conducted a 
review o f B a n k operations in fYR Macedonia, the i r effectiveness as we l l as the lessons drawn 
from the decade o f B a n k support. T h e y reviewed government’s challenges and p r io r i t ies as per

and projects has been j o i n t l y f ina l ized at the beginning o f December. T h e government fully 
endorses the CPS p rog ram . 

Fou r workshops were organized in different parts of 
the country (Tetovo, Kumanovo, 
Strumica and Bitola) for representatives of 
local governments, private sector and civil society 

organizations in the respective regions. The p r io r i t ies identified by pa r t ic ipan ts inc lude : (i)

PARTNERSHIPS 

I n addition to building strong partnership with Macedonian stakeholders, the Bank has built 
effective partnerships with development partners and donor organizations active in JYR 
Macedonia, mainly through the country office. The European Comm iss ion (EC), Netherlands 

Embassy, U S A I D and UN are the Bank’s key mu l t i la te ra l partners in fYR Macedon ia w i th

Since 1991, successive Macedon ian governments have p laced the prospect o f European 
in teg ra t ion at the top o f their agendas. In teg ra t ion in the EU has b e e n the one o f few sub jec ts o n 

which a l l p o l i t i c a l parties have reached a consensus. Since 2001, re la t ions between fYR 

Macedonia and the Eu ropean U n i o n (EU) have been deve lop ing in t h e context o f the 
S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion process (SAP). The SAP i s a f ramewo rk in which a new

The idea o f a SAP as a t o o l o f ancho r ing the countries fiom the Wes te rn Balkans towards the EU 
was born at the Zagreb Summ i t in Novembe r 2000, after the F e i r a C o u n c i l o f June 2000 that 
addressed the future o f the Ba lkans countries i s in Europe.20 In Zagreb, the Western B a l k a n 
countries made a p ledge t o abide by the EU ru les and cond i t iona l i ty , rece iv ing in re tu rn the 
prospect fo r EU accession based o n the T rea ty o f the Eu ropean U n i o n (TEU) and the 
Copenhagen c r i te r ia as we l l as o n assistance p rog ram t o p r om o t e and support this ambition.21 
The countries o f the Wes te rn Balkans also agreed that, w h e n signed, the S tab i l iza t ion and 
Association Agreements ( S A A s ) w o u l d be the p r i n c i p a l means t o begin p repa r ing themselves f o r 
the demands that the prospect o f accession t o the EU entails.22 In addition, the countries agreed 
(once they mee t the necessary ru les and conditions) t o rece ive f inanc ia l assistance (CARDS ) .

Measu r ing the progress 

EC measures the progress though a l l ac t iv i t ies undertaken by the state t o fulfill membership 
criteria: adoption o f primary and secondary leg is la t ion and i t s implementation. The repo r t i s 
prepared based o n the i n f o rm a t i o n available t o the EC, con t r ibu ted by the government and other 
partners. Findings are divided in to th ree chapters: (i) p o l i t i c a l c r i te r ia , (ii) economic c r i t e r i a and 
(iii) capacity t o take ove r membership ob l iga t ions . 

P o l i t i c a l c r i t e r i a 

P o l i t i c a l c r i te r ia are divided i n t o three sub-groups: a) Democ racy and r u l e o f law , b) H u m a n and 
m i n o r i t y rights and c) Reg iona l cooperation and in te rna t iona l ob l iga t ions . 
Under Democ racy and r u l e o f law, the repo r t describes the progress o f the w o r k o f the 
parliament, government, j u d i c i a r y and p u b l i c administration, as w e l l as the progress in the fight 
against corruption. A s ign i f ican t pa r t i s devoted t o the electoral process, w h i c h i s listed as one o f 
the five k e y p r io r i t ies f o r EU membership. The repo r t states that changes in the electoral 
leg is la t ion were appropriate and enabled satisfactory elections, acco rd ing t o in te rna t iona l 
standards. EC ’s assessment i s that the elections have passed in a generally peace fu l atmosphere, 
with ce r ta in i r r e g u l a r i t i e s o n the day o f the elections. E C recommends putting m a x i m u m e f f o r t 
i n t o adhering to in te rna t iona l standards f o r the next elections. As f o r the pos t -e lec t ion process 
and the fo rma t ion o f the new government, E C po in ts at the need t o decrease tensions be tween the 
ruling parties and the opposition, and especially the ethnic A l b a n i a n p o l i t i c a l parties (DU I -PDP ) . 
I t i s c ruc ia l f o r the economic s tab i l i ty that the government t r ies t o reach consensus f o r the key

and other areas that need two - th i rds m a j o r i t y o f votes in the Parliament (Badinter p r inc ip le ) . I t i s 
also emphasized that the oppos i t ion should be constructive in i t s ro le . In o rde r t o achieve the

w i l l be the key. The E C s t resses that f YR Macedon ia makes s ign i f ican t progress in adop t ing the 
laws, but that the imp lemen ta t ion o f ten lags behind. 
The Comm iss ion notes that the re i s a progress in public adm in is t ra t ion management th rough

further imp lemen ta t ion o f the C i v i l Service L a w . O f special impo r tance i s the L a w o n Po l ice 
(also one o f the k e y c r i te r ia o f the European partnership), but the de lay in i t s adop t ion has made 
the decentralization o f the p o l i c e impossible. The E C pays spec ia l attention 
imp lemen ta t ion o f this law, and stresses that an increased coope ra t ion be tween the ruling parties 
and the oppos i t ion i s needed t o achieve i t . T h e increased au tho r i ty g i v e n t o t h e Pub l ic A t to rney 
i s commended, with a caveat that strengthened cooperation w i th t h e Ministry o f In te rna l A f f a i r s 
i s needed. A negative assessment i s given t o the massive replacements in the p u b l i c 
administration f o l l ow i n g the elections, since this practice con f l ic ts with the a i m to depo l i t ic ize 
the pub l ic administration. 
The report c lea r ly states that, a l though the re i s progress, co r rup t ion i s s t i l l widely spread in the 
society. The few sentences and fines (in the customs, j u d i c i a r y and P u b l i c Revenue O f f ice ) are 
insu f f ic ien t t o diminish the p rob lem , w h i c h means that m o r e e f f o r t i s needed t o strengthen the 
institutions, increase transparency and implement laws. 
In the area o f Human and m i n o r i t y rights, a pos i t ive assessment i s given t o the strengthened 
freedom o f expression law , the abolishment o f the ob l iga to ry de ten t ion ( th rough changes in the 
c r im ina l procedures), and t o the strengthened in te rna l controls at the M i n i s t r y o f In te rna l A f fa i rs . 
The situation rega rd ing m i n o r i t y rights has also imp roved : the number o f persons emp loyed in 
the pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion w h o b e l o n g t o the ethnic m ino r i t ies and the number o f m i n o r i t y 
university students has increased. Howeve r , the repo r t states tha t l i t t l e progress has been made 
with regard to so lv ing issues re la ted to the R om a c omm u n i t y a n that the e f fo r ts fo r 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the N a t i o n a l Strategy fo r R o m a need t o be in tens i f ied . 
European Comm iss ion p o s i t i v e l y assesses the ac t ive pa r t ic ipa t ion o f fYR Macedon ia w i th regard 
to Reg iona l cooperation (CEFTA , S tab i l i ty Pact, etc.). T h e progress repo r t commends the 
government fo r i t s cons t ruc t ive r o l e during the K o s o v o talks, as well as the progress the coun t ry 
made in deve lop ing the re la t ions with the neighbors. 

Econom ic c r i t e r i a 

The tw o economic c r i te r ia f o r membership are : existence o f func t iona l ma rke t economy and 
capacity t o compete at the EU ma rke t . In the year covered by the report, fYR Macedon ia made a 
great s t r ide towards func t iona l ma rke t economy. There i s a general consensus o n the basics o f 
the economic po l icy , the mac roeconom ic s i tua t ion i s stable, and there i s a moderate GDP 
g row th . Specific progress has been made w i th shortening the time needed t o register a company 
by in t roduc ing one-stop-shop system (another k e y p r i o r i t y o f the Eu ropean partnership). The 
government has con t inued with the p r iva t iza t ion o f the rema in ing f ew state owned enterprises. 
Areas s t i l l impeding full func t ion ing o f the ma rke t economy relate t o d is func t ion ing r u l e o f l a w 
and lack o f lega l certainty, i n s u f f i c i e n t guarantee over the secu r i ty o f tenure and disparities in the 
labor market. The Comm iss ion has p o s i t i v e l y assessed the development o f the f inanc ia l sector 
(wh ich i s s t i l l lagg ing behind compared t o other candidate countries), the high l e v e l o f trade 
in te rac t ion with the U n i o n and the increased flexibility o f the labo r ma rke t . Areas where the 
progress i s stale are: the imp lemen ta t ion o f the bank rup tcy law , l o w l e v e l o f investments, s low 
reso lu t ion o f cou r t cases and i n e f f i c i e n c y in so lv ing the p r o b l em o f the i n d i r e c t state a i d (Le . 
some companies do n o t p a y taxes and social contributions).

Capac i ty to take ove r membe rsh ip comm i tmen ts 

Th is chapter o f the Progress Repo r t describes the progress in app rox ima t ion o f the na t iona l 
leg is la t ion towards the Eu ropean one, acqu is communau ta i re , w h i c h i s d i v i d e d i n t o 3 3 chapters. 
The progress i s f o l l ow e d th rough the app rox ima t ion o f legislation, but also th rough the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f l aw s and capacities o f the ins t i tu t ions t o fulfill the i r commitments. The 
progress o n the 3 3 chapters ove r the repo r t ing p e r i o d has been uneven. S i g n i f i c a n t progress has 

been made in some areas, such as customs, p u b l i c procurement, bus iness legislation, while other, 

such as in te l lec tua l property, telecommunications and state a i d are l a g g i n g behind. In some 
areas, such as the ag r icu l tu re and environment, a l though a progress has been made, the coun t ry i s 
s t i l l behind. I t i s therefore o f special importance t o g ive greater p r i o r i t y to these areas. 
The analysis o f the progress o n ce r ta in chapters leads to a conc lus ion that fYR Macedonia’s 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity i s qu i te uneven; mos t progress has been achieved in areas with stronger 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity. Ano the r key conc lus ion o f the repo r t i s that the progress i s s ign i f ican t 
when i t comes t o adop t ing p r im a r y and secondary legislation, but that the imp lemen ta t ion o f ten 
lags behind. The European Comm iss ion believes that enhanced e f fo r ts shou ld be put i n t o 
increasing the imp lemen ta t ion capacity. 

Conc lus ion 

The Progress Repo r t states that progress has been made during the p rev ious 12 mon ths with 
regard t o the membe rsh ip criteria. The focus o f the re fo rms has been o n rea l iz ing the key 
p r io r i t ies o f the Eu ropean Partnership, fulfillment o f the comm i tmen t o f the S tab i l iza t ion and 
Association Ag reemen t ( S A A ) and addressing the p rob lems i d e n t i f i e d in the ana ly t ica l repo r t o f 
the O p i n i o n f o r membe rsh ip . F o u r ou t o f five k e y c r i te r ia f o r EU Partnership have been fulfilled. 
The o n l y area whe re progress has n o t been su f f ic ien t i s the te lecommun ica t ion sector. With 
regard to the p o l i t i c a l criteria, mos t o f the pos i t ive ma rks we re g i v e n t o the in i t ia ted re fo rms in 
the j u d i c i a r y and the pa r l iamen ta ry elections. Respect o f m i n o r i t y rights rema ins at high level, 
while the decen t ra l iza t ion process i s deve lop ing sa t is fac to r i ly . Further strengthening o f the 
p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion i s necessary t o adapt the leg is la t ion and the ins t i tu t ions t o acqu is 
communau ta i re . FYR Macedon ia continues 
t o demonstrate mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty and 
economic g row th , but does no t have a func t ion ing ma rke t economy because o f the i n s u f f i c i e n t 
lega l ce r ta in ty and r u l e o f law . The progress o n i n d i v i d u a l chapters o f acqu is communau ta i re i s 
uneven; considerable leg is la t ion has been adopted, but the imp lemen ta t ion pace i s s low . 
The mos t impo r tan t conc lus ion o f the Progress Repo r t i s that the progress that fYR Macedon ia 
made so far i s i n s u f f i c i e n t f o r the E C t o propose start o f membe rsh ip negotiations. The start o f 
negotiations w i l l depend o n the re fo rms that are go ing t o b e imp lemen ted in the fo r thcom ing 
pe r iod and consequently w i l l b e rev iewed in the 2007 Progress Report, expected in Novembe r 
2007.

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia 

On July 28, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded 
the Article IV consultation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.23 

Background 

Economic performance has started to improve. After a decade of sluggish growth, in part 
the result of external shocks, growth has reached 4 percent for two years in a row. In 2005, 
growth was driven by strong exports. A broadly balanced fiscal position and the fixed 
exchange rate have kept inflation under control. The external position has strengthened, 
with gross reserves rising from €700 million at end-2004 to around €1,200 (more than 4 
months of imports or 25 percent of GDP) by May 2006. The recorded current account deficit fell 
sharply to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005 driven by increased private transfers, though these 
may also capture capital account transactions. 

The increase in reserves has allowed the central bank to cut interest rates. Bank credit has 
expanded, especially to households and in foreign currency, though from a low base and 
less rapidly than in the region’s other countries. 

The overall fiscal position showed a small surplus in 2005. Last year’s 0.3 percent of GDP 
central government budget surplus was better than projected by 1 percent of GDP, 
reflecting continuing underperformance of ministries’ Special Revenue Accounts, restraint in 
public employment, and procurement delays. One-off revenue developments, including the 
unusually high telecom monopoly dividend and advancing VAT payments by importers, also 
contributed. 

23 Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with 
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial 
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On 
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the 
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of 
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the 
country’s authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed 
during the July 28, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Ann e x 12 

In 2006, growth is projected to remain at 4 percent, with higher domestic demand offsetting 
some decline in net exports. Inflation is expected to increase to 3 percent, driven by supply 
factors, including higher tobacco taxes and oil prices. The official current account deficit is 
projected to widen to 3 percent of GDP due to higher oil prices, lower interest rates 
stimulating imports, and some slowing in last year’s increase in private transfers. 

Despite recent progress, structural weaknesses constrain the economy’s ability to increase 
employment and achieve more rapid output growth. Recorded unemployment in 2005 
reached 35 percent, one of the highest in the region, as employment has barely increased 
since 1995. Levels of financial intermediation and the stock of foreign direct investment 
remain low. Macedonia ranked poorly in international comparisons of the business 
environment due to high costs of opening and closing a business, hiring and laying off 
workers, and enforcing contracts. Property rights are poorly defined with the land cadastre 
incomplete, the tax wedge on labor remains high, and telecommunications services are 
expensive. The government has amended the constitution and passed new laws to 
introduce comprehensive judicial reform, yet implementation has jus t started. 

Executive Board Assessment 

Executive Directors commended the Macedonian authorities for their sound macroeconomic 
policies which, after a decade of sluggish growth, have now started to deliver economic 
recovery. Inflation has remained under control, the current account deficit has narrowed, 
international reserves have increased, and the fiscal position is sound. 

Directors noted that, despite these successes, considerable challenges lie ahead. These 
include raising living standards closer to European levels, reducing unemployment, and 
keeping the current account deficit under control. Directors stressed that the best way to 
meet these challenges would be by maintaining the country’s hard-won macroeconomic 
stability, and accelerating structural reforms. 

Directors viewed the 0.6 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target as one of the anchors of 
macroeconomic stability. They cautioned that loosening the fiscal stance would be 
premature in view of uncertainties about the current account’s true size, medium-term fiscal 
challenges, and the limited institutional capacity in line ministries to spend additional funds 
efficiently. Rationalization of the public sector should be undertaken before spending 
increases are envisaged. Going forward, Directors also encouraged efforts to strengthen 
the fiscal revenue base and reduce nondiscretionary spending. 
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg is appropriate given the Macedonian 
economy’s size and openness, and its limited international financial market integration. The 
peg has kept inflation low, and, although there are structural weaknesses in the economy, 
price competitiveness and the level of the exchange rate seem broadly satisfactory. 
Directors considered it important to continue to strengthen the central bank’s policy 
instruments. They welcomed the central bank’s recent interest rate cuts, but with euro-area 
rates higher and the need to see the effects of the cuts on credit and the real economy, a 
pause now seems appropriate.

Directors stressed the importance of structural reforms for accelerating growth. Institutional 
reforms, ranging from judicial reform and improving public governance to market 
liberalization and privatization, will be essential to developing a functioning marker 
economy. Reducing the very high unemployment rate should be a priority, and can be 
achieved through active labor market policies, reducing the tax wedge, and eliminating 
barriers to part-time employment. Financial market development is also needed, notably to 
lower intermediation costs, improve the credit culture, and enhance banking supervision. 
Such reforms would boost investment and employment, strengthen total factor productivity, 
and increase Macedonia's attractiveness for foreign direct investment. Directors noted that 
although these tasks are immense, so too are the potential rewards, and they encouraged 
the authorities to implement these reforms expeditiously. 

Macedonia's provision of data to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. 
Directors nevertheless underscored the need for continued efforts to improve the quality 
and coverage of statistics, including in the area of fiscal transparency. 

Public lnformation Notices (PINS) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's 
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country 
(or countries) concerned, PlNs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations 
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program 
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. 
PlNs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise 
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
