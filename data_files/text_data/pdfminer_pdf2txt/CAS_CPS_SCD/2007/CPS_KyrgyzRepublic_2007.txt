EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. Development Challenges. T h e K y r g y z Republic, a land - locked mountainous 
country, faces fo rm idab le geographic barriers t o ob ta in a high, sustained rate o f economic 
g row th . I t s iso la t ion i s a s ign i f ican t ba r r ie r for in te rna t iona l trade and transport, w h i c h i s 
further hampered by inadequate phys ica l infrastructure and p ro tec t ion is t po l ic ies in 
ne ighbo r ing countries. In addition, poo r governance and l o w ins t i tu t iona l and technical 
capacity have l im i t e d imp lemen ta t ion o f re fo rms in m a n y areas. Desp i te these 
challenges, the coun t ry succeeded in ach iev ing economic g r ow t h around 4 percent and 
reduc ing pove r ty s ign i f ican t ly during the la te 1990s and early 2000s th rough prudent 
macroeconomic management and structural re fo rms in some areas. 
ii. The K y r g y z Repub l ic i s s t i l l in the process o f building the State. The p o l i t i c a l 
environment i s turbulent, ma rked by the 2005 M a r c h r e v o l u t i o n and subsequent 
ins tab i l i ty with on -go ing disputes for powe r within and between Government, Parliament 
and c i v i l society, In th is complex p o l i t i c a l environment, i d e n t i f y l n g appropriate reforms, 
and building consensus around the i r imp lemen ta t ion i s d i f f icu l t . 
iii. T h e existence o f a vibrant c i v i l society, and active p o l i t i c a l debate and 
participation, w i l l assist the process o f consolidation o f the State. Po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and 
the sustainability o f the current government w i l l depend upon m a k i n g urgent and v is ib le 
improvements in economic and social conditions, as w e l l as clear results in attacking 
corruption, that meet the expectations o f the population. In addition, conso l ida t ing basic 
market re fo rms already carried out, together w i th dynam ic reg iona l g r ow t h provides 
opportunities fo r accelerating growth. 
iv . 
Strategic Priorities. The Government’s CDS f o r the pe r iod 2007-201 0 focuses 
o n four strategic pillars-economic 
development, governance and transparency in p u b l i c 
administration, human development, and environmental sustainability-and builds o n the 
strategy l a i d ou t in the Na t iona l Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (NPRS) f o r 2003-2005. 
v. 
The CDS focuses o n conso l ida t ing the macroeconomic s tab i l i ty attained during 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the NPRS, and accelerating structural re fo rms t o foster further g row th 
and pove r ty reduction. The CDS places im p r o v i n g governance high o n the agenda, and 
o n fighting and reduc ing co r rup t ion in particular. T h e CDS emphasizes the importance 
o f im p r o v i n g the accoun tab i l i ty o f o f f ic ia ls t o the people and re fo rms t o the leg is la t ive 
and budget processes t o reduce the capture o f the state by p ow e r f u l economic groups. 
Government ineffectiveness and poo r performance in de l ive r ing basic social services w i l l 
be tackled by deregulating the economy and strengthening p u b l i c administration. Human 
and social development p r io r i t ies in the CDS inc lude access t o increased and affordable 
education and hea l th services; favorable l iv ing conditions w i t h access t o water, sanitation 
and basic social services, and social p ro tec t ion f o r vulnerable groups in the population. 
vi. 
This j o i n t 
strategy o f five development partners-the As ian Development B a n k (ADB), the Swiss 
Cooperation (SC), the UK Department fo r International Development (DfI D), the W o r l d 
Bank G roup (WBG) and. the U n i t e d Na t ions Agencies-is 
c lose ly aligned with the 
Government’s development goals. Ce r ta in strategic choices have been agreed among the 
development partners and have been applied across a l l donor groups, i n c l u d i n g the W o r l d 
Bank ’s program: (i) focus o n areas where support €or re fo rms i s already embedded; (ii)

The Kyrgyz Republic Joint Country Support Strategy program focus. T h e 

m i t iga te r i s k s associated with high indebtedness and g r ow t h vo la t i l i ty ; (iii) focus o n basic 
reforms, as opposed t o complex operations; and (iv) focus o n ESW and capacity building. 
v i i . 
JCSS partners w i l l focus their programs o n fou r areas iden t i f ied in the CDS as 
pa r t icu la r ly impo r tan t fo r achieving the overarching goals, inc lud ing : 
0 Econom ic management consistent w i t h strong and sustained p ro -poo r g row th : 
strengthening the budget process and cross-cutting re fo rms in p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management, and a l ign ing f inanc ia l management with government p r io r i t ies ; 
Reduc ing corruption, im p r o v i n g governance and e f fec t ive p u b l i c administration: 
deregulating the economy, increasing transparency, im p r o v i n g the capacity o f the 
c i v i l service and p u b l i c administration, and lega l re fo rm ; 
Building sustainable human and social capital th rough imp roved hea l th and education 
outcomes, i n c l u d i n g access t o and im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f health, education and 
social p ro tec t ion services; and 
Ensuring environmental sustainability and natural resource management. 
v i i i . The World Bank Group Program. This i s the f i r s t j o i n t coun t ry strategy f o r the 
K y r g y z Repub l ic and the Europe and Central As ia region. The WBG p rog ram 
contributes t o the strategic goals ou t l ined in the JCSS, with a focus o n supporting the 
Government’s e f fo r ts t o imp rove the environment f o r business and economic g row th and 
imp rove the qua l i ty o f and access t o basic services (health, education, water and 
sanitation). The WBG strategy emphasizes se lec t iv i ty g iven the l im i t e d IDA resources 
and l im i ta t ions p laced o n the Government’s p u b l i c investment program. Building o n 
lessons learned, and in l i n e w i t h the p r inc ip les o f the JCSS, the B a n k Program adopts a 
sequenced and long - te rm approach t o development challenges, building o n results 
achieved in f i r s t generation projects, targeting ac t iv i t ies where projects can show v is ib le 
resu l ts t o the population, and leveraging our lend ing and ana ly t ica l w o r k t o attract 
f inanc ing f r om other development partners. 
i x . 
Risks. Risks t o CDS and JCSS imp lemen ta t ion inc lude those related t o p o l i t i c a l 
ins tab i l i ty , weak imp lemen ta t ion capacity, and exogenous shocks. The JCSS proposes a 
number o f measures t o m i t iga te the r i s k s . 
Monitoring and Evaluation. The comm i tmen t t o a results-based f ramewo rk 
x. 
represents a step fo rwa rd fo r the authorities and the JCSS partners. T h e WBG, ADB and 
other partners are w o r k i n g together with Government t o develop a robust mon i to r ing and 
evaluation f ramewo rk in l i n e w i t h the CDS f ramewo rk under preparation. The annual 
j o i n t coun t ry po r t fo l io rev iew process and j o i n t annual rev iew o f the CDS w i l l p rov ide 
opportunities t o r e v i ew progress. T o the extent possible, the rev iew w i l l use ex is t ing 
government processes as the m a i n avenues f o r detailed discussion, dialogue and 
generating in fo rma t ion . 
x i . 
Conclusion. The need for donors t o present a j o i n t pos i t ion t o the i r c l ien t i s 
greater n ow than ever. The new Government i s under pressure t o deliver, and the 
development commun i ty i s struggling t o w o r k ou t h o w best t o p rov ide support w i thou t 
overburdening the administration. The JCSS i s a first step t o further ha rmon iza t ion 
efforts and ach iev ing results based o n the p r inc ip les framed in the Paris Dec la ra t ion o n

A. The Political Context 

4. 
F r om October 1990 t o M a r c h 2005, the K y r g y z Repub l ic was governed by an 
inc reas ing ly authoritarian presidential regime’. T h e President mediated the compe t i t ion 
between diverse groups w i t h i n the e l i te f o r in f luence and economic rents. T h i s resulted 
in frequent changes in personnel at the p o l i t i c a l l e v e l and contributed t o l o w capacity in 
imp lemen t ing po l ic ies and reforms. The Government was less open ly repressive and was 
perceived t o be mo re disposed t o economic r e f o rm than others in the region. 

5 . 

During the pe r iod 1990 t o 2005, the K y r g y z Repub l ic made considerable progress 
in i t s t rans i t ion t o a ma rke t based economy. T h e economy began t o recover f r om the

break-up o f the Soviet U n i o n in 1990 , w h i c h was associated with severe declines in 
output, high i n f l a t i o n and b reakdown o f the supply chains. The macroeconomic situation 
was stabilized and economic re fo rms l a i d the g round fo r a transfer o f l a n d and other 
assets i n t o p r iva te ownership and generated p r iva te sector-led g r ow t h since the mid 

1990s. 

6. 
Progress in re fo rms was m ixed . In some areas, s ign i f ican t re fo rms were carried 
ou t during the mid 1990s. These successes, together w i th a w i l l ingness o f the 
Government t o engage in dialogue in mos t r e f o rm areas, p robab ly encouraged donors t o 
overestimate the depth o f re fo rms and contributed t o an overambitious r e f o rm agenda o n 
the pa r t o f donors, The Government meanwh i le was read i ly accepting o f a l l donor 
suggested reforms, even those that i t was neither able n o r comm i t ted t o implement, in 
order t o ma in ta in external f inanc ia l f lows . T h e resu l t was that, w h i l e some rea l economic 
re fo rms were carried out, m a n y re fo rms remained o n paper, either as p o l i c y statements o r 
as legislation, were n o t implemented, were unfinished, o r w o u l d be unde rm ined by ad 
hoc p o l i c y interventions, g iven the weak ownership o f the re fo rms . 

7. 

The generally unexpected and so-called Tulip Revolution o f M a r c h 2005, when 
President Akaev was ousted f r om power, was triggered by p u b l i c dissatisfaction with the 
fraudulent February 2005 elections. Underlying dissatisfaction w i t h a lack o f tangible 
impac t f r om economic reforms, poo r governance, co r rup t ion and increasing nepotism, 
were p robab ly also significant. T h e revo lu t ion i t s e l f had nationalist connotations w h i c h 
have since been manifested in a g r ow i n g distrust o f the international commun i ty . T h e 
donors were perceived as hav ing been too close t o the o l d regime, and im p l i c i t l y as 
hav ing fbeled co r rup t ion w i thou t ach iev ing s ign i f ican t development. 

8 . 

The revo lu t ion also set in m o t i o n a process o f m o r e open p o l i t i c a l con f l ic ts 
between the Presidency, Government and parliament, and within these institutions, with 
the active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society. There have been some change o f personalities in 
m a n y government positions and some impo r tan t gains in terms o f p o l i t i c a l freedoms have 
been made; however, the i n i t i a l effect o f the revo lu t ion was t o worsen the governance 
environment. The country’s assets are in demand by various interest groups, and there 
have been several disputes over p rope r ty r i g h t s . In many instances, the consequences 
have been violent. 

9 . 

Since April 2006, there have been repeated large ra l l ies and demonstrations in 
w h i c h protesters have demanded imp lemen ta t ion o f p rom ised re fo rms and expressed 
general resentment against ine f fec t ive po l icy , co r rup t ion and g r ow i n g c r im ina l i ty . These 
protests culminated with the imp lemen ta t ion o f delayed cons t i tu t iona l reforms in 
Novembe r 2006. T h e new cons t i tu t ion transferred some o f the President’s powers t o 
Parliament; however, amendments that restored the Presidential powe rs were re- 
introduced by his supporters in Parliament and passed in December 2006. 

10 . 

The comb ina t ion o f resurgent na t iona l ism and a lack o f t r u s t by c i v i l society in 
the 
International F inanc ia l 
Ins t i tu t ions (IFI’s) were 
impo r tan t elements 
in the 
Government’s decision in February 2007 n o t t o seek assistance unde r the H e a v i l y

reaching p o l i c y re fo rms . 

1 1. 
Cons t i tu t iona l debates are ongoing, where other lead ing oppos i t ion movements in 
the coun t ry are demanding the authorities t o undertake cons t i tu t iona l re fo rm (with 
reinstatement o f the spirit o f the Novembe r 2006 Cons t i tu t ion ) and ea r ly presidential 
elections. La rge protests were organized t o this effect in April 2007. T h e President and 
his Government, l e d by oppos i t ion representative A lmazbek Atambaev, re-established 
control, but the d i rec t ion o f f u t u r e constitutional r e f o rm i s s t i l l unclear.

The K y r g y z Repub l ic i s s t i l l in the process o f building the State. In this complex 
p o l i t i c a l environment, 
i d e n t i f y l n g appropriate re fo rms and, 
impo r tan t ly , building 
consensus around them w i l l be d i f f icu l t . Nevertheless, there are a numbe r o f areas where 
support f o r change i s already embedded. The existence o f a vibrant c i v i l society, w h i c h 
i s the mos t robust in the Central As ian region, w i l l assist the process o f consolidation o f 
the state. Po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and the sustainability o f the current Government w i l l depend 
upon making urgent and visible improvements in economic and social conditions, as well 
as clear resu l ts in attacking corruption, that meet the expectations o f the population. 

13. 
The Government’s new CDS was endorsed by the N a t i o n a l Development 
Counc i l and launched by Presidential decree o n M a y 16, 2007. T h e document attributes 
the l im i t e d pace o f economic development and the skewed d is t r ibu t ion o f wea l th t o the 
un f in ished development agenda ( inc lud ing the delays in p r i v a t i z i n g state enterprises that 
are deemed to be o f strategic importance, fos te r ing energy sector e f f ic iency and fo rg ing a 
friendly business c l ima te conducive to p r iva te sector growth) w h i c h was undermined by 
weak governance. The challenge for the new Government w i l l b e t o p rov ide a coherent

Despite a sound reco rd o f macroeconomic performance in recent years, 
economic g r ow t h has been modest and vo la t i le ; a large burden o f external debt has been 
accumulated and in teg ra t ion i n t o g loba l p roduc t ion and trade remains limited. These 
outcomes re f lec t the pattern in economic reforms. W h i l e over 1994-98 the K y r g y z 
Repub l ic had been among the fastest 
reformers among the Commonwea l th o f 
Independent States (CIS) economies, the pe r iod between 1999-2006 witnessed reversal 
and stagnation in r e f o rm efforts. The paragraphs that f o l l ow present an assessment o f the 
K y r g y z Republic’s g r ow t h performance since independence. 

15. 
Few economies face i n i t i a l conditions as challenging as in the K y r g y z Repub l ic : 
w i t h a sma l l popu la t ion (just over 5 m i l l i o n ) and one o f the least accessible locations in 
the wo r ld . I t s iso la t ion i s a s ign i f ican t barrier for international trade and transport, w h i c h 
i s hrther hampered by inadequate phys ica l infrastructure and protectionist po l ic ies in 

ne ighbo r ing countries. O n l y about seven percent o f the country 's land i s arable. The t w o 
m a j o r natural resources are hyd ropowe r and gold. K n o w n go ld reserves are b e i n g 
depleted and, w i thou t new discoveries, they w i l l b e close t o exhaustion within a decade. 
Ou tpu t o f hyd ropowe r has been constrained by dep le t ion o f assets that has taken place 
over the past 15 years. 

16. 
Aga ins t this background, the t ra jec to ry o f K y r g y z output since t rans i t ion i s 
s im i la r t o that o f the other small, resource p o o r C IS countries (see F i g u r e l ) . After an 
i n i t i a l decline, real Gross Domes t ic Product (GDP) started t o recover in 1996 and reached 
80 percent o f i t s pre-transition l e v e l by 2005. The i n i t i a l output shock in the K y r g y z 
Repub l ic (50 percent) was less severe than in other sma l l resource poo r C IS countries2 
(where i t was mo re than 60 percent). 

17. 
Ou tpu t g r ow t h was r a p i d

g r ow t h was combined w i t h high

lowe r than in 
s im i la r C IS countries 
(Le., 6-7 
percent over the who le pe r iod and 
above 8 percent since 2000). There 
have been th ree m a j o r decelerations 
in 1998, 2002 and 2005 due t o 
various exogenous shocks, inc lud ing the 1998 reg iona l f inanc ia l crisis, the 2002 d rop in

The i n i t i a l pe r iod o f g r ow t h and

f inanc ia l crisis o f 1998 , w h i c h had a 
disproportionate impac t o n the K y r g y z 
Republic. This was p a r t l y due t o the 
K y r g y z Republic’s

The above fuels interference by p u b l i c o f f ic ia ls in the economy. 
There are 
numerous mechanisms f o r this inc lud ing a rb i t ra ry decisions, m u l t i p l e inspection, 
discretionary issue o f licenses, delays in issuing pe rm i ts and documents and even d i rec t

d im in ished the a b i l i t y and incentives o f the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion t o act in the p u b l i c 
interest and respond t o the needs o f the emerging p r iva te sector. This was the case in 
agriculture, where despite the l ibe ra l iza t ion o f market and prices and an i n i t i a l strong 
supply response t o reforms, the absence o f supplementary services, ma rke t access and 
shortsighted trade po l ic ies became a constraint f o r further g r ow t h and diversification, 
once the domestic ma rke t was saturated. In addition, the ag r icu l tu ra l sector experienced 
a decline in i t s terms o f trade, s im i la r t o other t rans i t ion economies. In the absence o f 
alternative sources o f g row th and employment in the economy, agriculture absorbed 
surplus labor released from other sectors and remained a l o w p r o d u c t i v i t y ac t iv i ty .

pove r ty f e l l by 5 percent and ove ra l l pove r ty f e l l by 2 percent. T h e reduc t ion in pove r ty 
has also been assisted by the decline in the rea l prices o f u t i l i t ies , w h i c h continue t o be 
heav i ly subsidized and are far b e l ow their cost recove ry levels. M u c h o f the decline in 
pove r ty stems p r im a r i l y f r o m the f a l l in extreme poverty, especially in ru ra l areas. 
Mode ra te pove r ty (the difference between ove ra l l pove r ty and extreme pove r ty ) declined 
ma rg ina l ly f r om 33 percent t o 32 percent and la rge ly due t o a decrease in urban moderate 
pove r ty rates.

Concurrent with changes in pove r ty , inequa l i ty has fa l len s l i g h t l y during 2000- 
2005. O f f i c i a l estimates o f the Gini coe f f ic ien t show a decline f r om 0.30 t o 0.28 during 
this period, 
Inequa l i ty levels in the K y r g y z Repub l ic rema in l ow e r than in other E C A 
countries re f lec t ing the we l fa re system o f large social direct and ind i rec t transfers. D i r e c t 
expenditure o n social p ro tec t ion has been high, though declining-20 
percent o f GDP in 
1995 and 12 percent in 2001 and was topped up with ind i rec t subsidies th rough utility 
prices estimated at 7-8 percent o f GDP. Inequa l i ty in u rban areas has seen the greatest 
improvement in this pe r iod though the sources o f imp rovemen t requ i re further analysis. 
This phenomenon m a y b e d r i v e n by the greater employment opportunities available in 
the services sectors, greater access t o subsidized u t i l i t i e s in the u rban areas o r due t o the 
higher remittance income that has helped t o raise incomes among the l ow e r quintiles.

B o t h o f f - f a rm and on - fa rm income have been impo r tan t t o the reduc t ion in r u r a l 
pove r ty . The agriculture sector g rew by an annual average o f 2.6 percent during 2000-

popu la t ion and mo re so f o r those in the lowe r quintiles. However, over time, earned 
income f r om labo r o r entrepreneurial ac t iv i ty has s ign i f ican t ly increased in importance 
f o r the ru ra l popu la t ion and n o w comprises three-quarters o f to ta l income - ind ica t ing the

32. 
Poor domestic labo r ma rke t outcomes linked t o l o w output g r ow t h and l i t t l e 
economic d ive rs i f ica t ion have hindered a faster reduc t ion in pove r ty and l e d t o greater 
out-migration. L o w wages, underemployment and ou t r igh t unemp loymen t are impo r tan t

under-employment w h i c h prevents them f r om increasing to ta l income. Thus, i t i s no t 
surprising that mo re able-bodied workers are leav ing the K y r g y z Repub l ic t o w o r k

T h e K y r g y z Repub l ic has a m i x e d track reco rd in i t s progress towards ach iev ing 
the na t iona l M D G s . I t i s u n l i k e l y that many o f the MDG targets w i l l b e reached by 201 5 
i f the coun t ry continues along i t s current path. The coun t ry can po ten t ia l ly achieve i t s 
targe ts o n pove r ty reduction, universal enrolment in p r im a r y education and literacy, and 
ensuring environmental sustainability. Howeve r , the Kyrgyz Repub l ic i s a l o n g w a y

TB and other in fec t ious diseases and in p r o v i d i n g safe drinking water. Problems o f 
ma lnu t r i t ion and under-consumption persist, especially among r u r a l ch i ld ren and women. 
In addition, considerable e f fo r t w i l l be needed t o achieve gender equa l i ty at the post- 
education 
level. Making sustainable progress towards MDGs w i l l require the 
development and imp lemen ta t ion o f a concrete p l a n o f ac t ion and targeted investments in 
p r i o r i t y areas. 

35. 
En ro lmen t rates in basic education in the K y r g y z Repub l ic are almost 95 percent, 
and the l i te racy rate i s 99 percent. The 2003 household survey data show some d ispa r i ty 
in the enrolment rates o f school-age ch i ld ren (age 7-15) by household welfare, rang ing 
f r om 8 8 percent f o r the poorest quintile t o 94 percent f o r the richest quintile. However, 
over t h e past 5 years, the enrolment rate has been declining, coupled w i th the dec l in ing 
and uneven qua l i ty o f education and a lack o f qua l i f ied teachers in ru ra l areas. The 
i n a b i l i t y t o p rov ide good textbooks continues t o be a pressing issue, as i s the maintenance 
and development o f school infrastructure. The i r lack o f access t o qua l i ty education and 
opportunities f o r sustainable employment makes the you th one o f the mos t vulnerable 
groups. 

36. 
Healthcare r e f o rm in the K y r g y z Repub l ic has been ongo ing f o r 10 years within 
the 
f ramewo rk o f the Manas Na t iona l Healthcare Re fo rms (1 996-2005). 
The 
imp lemen ta t ion o f Manas I resulted in the development o f an in te rna t iona l ly recognized 
p r im a r y healthcare r e f o rm mode l with the f o l l ow i n g building b locks : increasing the focus 
o n p r im a r y hea l th care and f am i l y medicine, res t ruc tu r ing service de l ive ry and

available throughout the country; although access o f the poo r t o general med ica l services 
remains a s ign i f ican t i s s u e due t o high out-of-pocket costs. 

37. 
There has been general imp rovemen t in hea l th outcome indicators, such as infant 
(IMR), c h i l d (USMR) and maternal m o r t a l i t y (MMR). Va r ia t ion o f the IMR and U 5 M R

The K y r g y z Repub l ic can po ten t ia l ly reach the MDG targets f o r environmental 
sustainability. Progress o n this f ion t , however, has been very slow, la rge ly due t o the 
lack o f p o l i t i c a l w i l l and comm i tmen t to ins t i tu t iona l ize and e f fec t ive ly imp lemen t

Gender equity has been maintained in the education system with adequate female 
pa r t ic ipa t ion at a l l l e v e l s o f education. However, ach iev ing gender equa l i ty remains a 
serious i s s u e at post educational level; in fact, the K y r g y z Repub l ic has experienced an 
increased deepening o f gender inequa l i ty since the f a l l o f the Soviet Un ion . Women 
constitute 54 percent o f the unemployed, and their wages make up 66 percent o f those o f 
men. A lso , there has been a drastic decline in women's pa r t ic ipa t ion in dec is ion -mak ing 
processes and po l i t ics . Currently, there are n o women members in Parliament, o r in the

E. Governance and Corruption 

42. 
As a r e s u l t o f weak capacity and p o o r l y de f ined ins t i tu t iona l responsibilities, 
mechanisms t o resolve con f l ic ts over p o l i c y are underdeveloped and the a b i l i t y o f the 
Government t o e f fec t ive ly enforce po l ic ies and laws i s limited. Within the c i v i l service, 
extensive patronage ne two rks and l o w p a y have made i t d i f f i c u l t t o establish a 
professional merit-based c i v i l service. Moreover, since the M a r c h 2005 revo lu t ion , in 
m a n y ins t i tu t ions technocrats have been displaced by adm in is t ra t ive ly inexperienced 
o f f ic ia ls , and thus p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion has been weakened. I t i s o n l y recen t ly that the 
importance o f a merit-based c i v i l service has been recognized, and steps have been taken 
to imp lemen t reforms with regard t o requirements fo r the compe t i t ive selection o f c i v i l 
servants. 

43. 
M a n y o f the po ten t ia l benefits o f a market economy have n o t been rea l ized as 
businesses are subject t o numerous inspections and requirements, w i th o f ten d i f fe ren t 
agencies inspecting the same aspect o f the business. T a x regulations are numerous, 
inconsistent, and are constantly be ing amended. 
Inconsistencies in the tax code create 
opportunities for rent-seeking behavior by tax inspectors, auditors, and tax police. 
Po l i t ica l ins tab i l i ty has also contributed t o ren t seeking th rough the red is t r ibu t ion o f 
assets held by o f f ic ia ls o f the p rev ious regime. In add i t ion t o endemic administrative 
corruption, there i s widespread rent extraction th rough key state owned enterprises, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the mining, energy and communications sectors, w h i c h undoub ted ly 
creates strong interests opposed t o reforms. Problems with governance and co r rup t ion 
have been exacerbated since the 2005 revo lu t ion .

requ i red t o satisfy basic needs. The Government w i l l also foster p r iva te sector 
pa r t ic ipa t ion in the energy sector. T h e cabinet has established a Ministry o f Industry, 
Ene rgy and F u e l w h i c h w i l l b e responsible f o r energy p o l i c y . Some decisions, such as a 
medium-term tariff po l icy , measures t o imp rove f inanc ia l discipline, and imp rove 
corporate governance and transparency have been taken recently, w h i c h shows a renewed 
commitment. 

54 . 

The CDS places a high emphasis o n p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion . 
However, 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the chosen po l ic ies and measures-which 
are n o t new-remains 
a 
concern, especially g iven the lack o f lega l framework, p o l i t i c a l consensus o n p r iva te 
sector participation, etc. The desired investment levels are too high at US$3 .5 b i l l i o n fo r 
the energy sector alone, and the coun t ry w o u l d b e ex t reme ly fortunate t o m o b i l i z e 
perhaps a ten th o f such amount. 

5 5 . 

T o enable the mining sector t o p l a y i t s rightful r o l e in spurring strong economic 
growth, the Government i s comm i t ted t o creating a suitable lega l and regu la to ry 
environment that p rov ides security o f tenure th rough an e f f ic ien t l icens ing system f o r 
l o c a l and external investors. The CDS proposes n ew leg is la t ion that w i l l create 
transparency in the sector in the award o f concessions as w e l l as the regu la t ion and 
supervision the reo f and the adoption o f a fiscal reg ime consistent with international 
norms. Pub l ish ing audited f inanc ia l reports o f state revenues o r ig ina t ing f r o m the mining 
sector in accordance with the country’s obligations under the E IT I w i l l lend c red ib i l i ty t o 
the Government’s stated commitments. 

56 . 

The CDS focuses o n agriculture as a k e y sector f o r output and employment. The 
Government i s comm i t ted t o comp le t ion o f land re fo rms and new leg is la t ion in support 
o f agro-processing industry development. 
I r r i g a t i o n i s a c r i t ica l input for p ro f i tab le and 
market oriented ag r icu l tu ra l production, but i s dealt with very briefly in the CDS . In 
addition, specific proposals in the document bear n o apparent relevance t o the i r 
underlying goals and d o no t take i n t o account the ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses and lack o f the 
resources needed t o imp lemen t them.

H. Improving Governance and the Business Environment 

57 . 

The CDS places im p r o v i n g governance high o n the agenda, and o n fighting and 
reduc ing co r rup t ion in particular. I t recognizes that a p r inc ipa l constraint o n economic 
development i s corruption. Government ineffectiveness and poo r performance in 
de l ive r ing basic social services w i l l b e tack led by unde r tak ing p o l i t i c a l reform, 
deregulating the economy, effective p u b l i c administration, and lega l re fo rm . A key 
element i s the creation o f an impa r t ia l and e f fec t ive j u d i c i a l system. T h e CDS envisages 
m o v i n g away f r om authoritarian approaches in p u b l i c governance and a t rans i t ion t o a 
genuinely democratic management m o d e l in partnership with c i v i l society. F isca l 
decentralization w i l l be pursued actively, i n c l u d i n g by giving l o c a l commun i t ies greater 
au tho r i ty over spending priorities, and strengthening their budgets so that pove r ty 
reduc t ion can b e achieved mo re e f fec t ive ly o n the ground. 

5 8 . 

Policies and actions w i l l focus o n creating a favorable bus iness environment that 
supports p r iva te sector development and an investment c l ima te that w i l l attract fo re ign 
investment. Re fo rm ing the tax system, i n c l u d i n g l ow e r i n g taxes, increasing the tax t o 
GDP ratio, improvements in tax administration t o m i n im i z e harassment o f taxpayers and 
boost compliance, and im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency o f customs adm in is t ra t ion w i l l be 
p r io r i t ies , In addition, continued e f fec t ive f inanc ia l sector supervision t o forestall r i s k s 
and boost f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion w o u l d b e necessary t o unde rp in improvements in the 
bus iness climate. The authorities p l a n t o use the Pub l ic Investment P rog ram (PIP) as a 
k e y veh ic le t o channel resources t o the infrastructure that w i l l he lp development o f the 
agricultural, indus t r ia l and social sectors, 

5 9 . 

T h e CDS recognize the importance o f p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion and c i v i l service 
re fo rms and the necessity o f building an e f fec t ive and professional Government t o ensure 
a favorable environment fo r p r iva te sector development and economic g row th . The 
document includes a range o f activities, such as op t im iza t ion o f the Government’s 
structure based o n func t iona l reviews, cadre r igh ts iz ing , and strengthening capacity o f 
c i v i l servants. However, the Government has conducted such ho r izon ta l functional 
rev iews o f a l l ministries and agencies in the past w i t h some support f r om donors, but 
fa i led t o imp lemen t the mos t c r i t ica l recommendations o f these reviews.

I. Human Resources Development 

60. 

The CDS recognizes that the f u t u r e o f the K y r g y z Repub l ic i s dependent o n the 
qua l i ty o f i t s labor force and the we l l -be ing o f i t s population. H um a n and social 
development p r io r i t ies in the CDS inc lude access t o increased and affordable education 
and hea l th services; favorable l iv ing cond i t ions with access t o water, sanitation and basic 
social services, and social p ro tec t ion f o r vulnerable groups in the popu la t ion . However, 
the authorities w i l l need t o translate these rather b road p o l i c y statements i n t o a set o f 
time-bound actions with adequate a l loca t ion o f resources in the context o f the annual 
budgets, w i t h a clear and appropriate p ro -poo r focus.

The CDS summarizes k e y issues fac ing the hea l th sector and h o w the 
Government's comprehensive Manas Taa l im i plan w i l l address th is during the CDS 
period, T h e coun t ry has shown strong performance o n hea l th r e f o rm over the pa r t 10 
years, and the Government i s comm i t ted t o continued good performance o n budget 
p lann ing and execution that w i l l broaden and deepen these e f fo r ts t o address the 
rema in ing issues in th is sector, i n c l u d i n g achieving the health-related M D G s . The 
Government i s also comm i t ted t o continue the upward trend in ove ra l l f inanc ing fo r the 
sector to compensate f o r the declines witnessed f r om 2000 t o 2004. 

62. 
The CDS lays ou t a series o f impo r tan t tasks fac ing the education sector. I t 
iden t i f ies p r o v i d i n g access and im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f basic secondary education 
provided, 
inc lud ing 
the ava i lab i l i ty o f good 
textbooks and appropriate school 
infrastructure. The Government intends t o bolster targeted support f o r ch i ld ren f r om 
vulnerable households, and gradually increase f inanc ing o f p r ima ryheconda ry education, 
w h i l e in t roduc ing a cap i ta t ion f inanc ing mode l that incorporates minimum standards. 
The Government i s comm i t ted t o ra is ing expenditure o n education f r o m 4.9 percent o f 
GDP in 2005 t o 5.5 percent o f GDP by 2010. 

63. 
The CDS co r rec t ly identifies poo r targeting as one o f the m a i n problems in the 
social assistance system, Consistent with good in te rna t iona l practice, the K y r g y z 
Repub l ic had imp lemen ted a system t o i d e n t i f y low - income households - the U n i f i e d 
M o n t h l y Bene f i t (UMB ) -p rov id ing 
guaranteed minimum income t o 534,000 persons 
(10.4 percent o f the popu la t ion ) in 2005. An imp roved UMB me thodo logy has been 
submitted fo r pa r l iamen ta ry approval, and i t s imp lemen ta t ion w o u l d imp rove targeting 
and reduce beneficiaries by at least 15 percent, using the savings t o increase benefits. 

64. 
The analysis o f environment sustainability in the CDS-the 
fourth pillar- 
iden t i f ies m a n y issues i n c l u d i n g the r i s k s o f natural disasters f r om earthquakes, 
mudslides and avalanches (the latter tw o linked to the p rob lem o f deforestation) and the 
threats t o hea l th from u ran ium t a i l i n g and other hazardous wastes. A k e y government 
p r i o r i t y i s the appropriate management o f natural resources. Howeve r , the l i n k s t o 
economic and social development are less w e l l articulated. 

J. Results of and Lessons Learned from NPRS Implementation 

65. 
The CDS builds o n the r e s u l t s achieved during the imp lemen ta t ion o f the NPRS . 
So l id resu l ts were achieved in pove r ty reduction, as described in the section o n pove r ty 
and inequa l i ty . The Government 's reco rd o n im p r o v i n g governance has been weaker that 
what was hoped for. Measures t o increase efficiency, transparency and f iduc ia ry controls 
w i t h i n the p u b l i c sector have proceeded reasonably w e l l at the technical level, but 
comm i tmen t t o drive th rough core p o l i c y reforms-particularly with respect t o co r rup t ion 
and c i v i l service reform-has decreased considerably. 

66. 
T w o key lessons became apparent during the second rev iew " o f NPRS 
implementation: (i) the need f o r sound resource planning and mob i l iza t ion , and (ii) the 

lo

need f o r an e f fec t ive mon i to r ing mechanism. The NPRS and the po l ic ies t o imp lemen t i t 
were n o t l i n k e d s t rong ly enough t o the state budget and resource planning. Government 
and donors also need t o become mo re outcome focused, th rough the adoption o f a 
common m o n i t o r i n g framework, and link sector re fo rms and investment operations m u c h 
mo re c lose ly with the na t iona l budget process. 

67 . 

The r e f o rm agenda, pa r t icu la r ly with respect t o energy, the c i v i l service and the 
business environment, was too complex and ove r ly ambitious in an environment o f 
limited p o l i t i c a l w i l l . Imp lemen ta t ion in mos t sectors has been weak; however, there have 
been good results in the areas o f hea l th and social protection, commun i ty managed 
development, 
land reg is t ra t ion and i r r iga t ion . S ign i f ican t improvements in donor 
coo rd ina t ion notwithstanding, projects and programs b e i n g spread across too m a n y areas, 
adversely impac ted imp lemen ta t ion capacity. Greater government ownership, along with 
better cross-sectoral diagnosis in areas such as investment climate, imp roved service 
p rov is ion and p u b l i c sector transparency i s crucial. 

68 . 

This experience suggests that the mos t use fu l interventions w i l l b e those that 
support basic reforms rather than second o r third generation re fo rms where ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity has n o t yet been developed. Thus, greater se lec t iv i ty i s called for, b o t h in the 
areas o f engagement and between donor programs, tha t do n o t place a heavy bu rden o n 
the Government. I t i s also impo r tan t that a ve ry ca re fu l examination o f ins t i tu t iona l 
arrangements such as the establishment o f Project Imp lemen ta t ion Units (PIUs) o r p o l i c y 
units staffed by consultants be undertaken be fo re interventions are agreed t o with the 
Government. 

K. Mon i to r ing and Eva lua t ing Progress o f the CDS 

69 . 

In i d e n t i f y l n g approaches fo r m i t i g a t i n g pove r ty and social deprivation, the CDS 
se ts up benchmarks consistent with the MDGs. The CDS has enhanced the mechanisms 
f o r m o n i t o r i n g and evaluating progress, although these a re s t i l l n o t fully articulated; the 
strategy includes plans t o i n v o l v e c i v i l society and development pa r tne rs in evaluating 
progress during implementation. 

7 0 . M o n i t o r i n g indicators f o r the CDS concentrate largely o n macroeconomic 
outcomes, governance and bus iness environment outcomes. 
In addition, there are 
m o n i t o r i n g targets in some o f the p roduc t ion sectors, such as agriculture and energy, 
w h i c h w i l l assist in imp lemen t ing the CDS . The CDS also proposes m o n i t o r i n g o f the 
strategy b o t h th rough o f f i c i a l channels and by c i v i l society.

IV . DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

71. 
D r aw i n g o n the analysis in the preceding sections, a number o f k e y challenges 
emerge that need t o b e addressed and overcome. First, sho r ing up p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t 
and coun t ry ownership . o f the r e f o rm agenda w i l l b e crucial. Second, capacity- 
resources, technical and imp lemen ta t ion capacity-will 
need t o b e developed. Third, 
p r i o r i t i z i n g and sequencing the imp lemen ta t ion o f the r e f o rm agenda w i l l have t o b e 
wo rked ou t in each o f the p r i o r i t y areas identified by the Government. T h e f o l l ow i n g 
paragraphs ou t l ine in greater de ta i l specific challenges that the Government faces and 
w i l l have t o address in implementing the CDS . 

(i) Supporting Growth over the Long-Term 

72. 
A k e y macroeconomic challenge f o r the Government i s t o overcome the 
rema in ing structural weaknesses o f the economy and t o m o v e towa rd sustained output 
g row th . The Government i s comm i t ted to reduce the general government p r im a r y de f ic i t 
t o an average o f 2.7 percent o f GDP during 2007-10, re f lec t ing continued improvements 
in revenue mob i l iza t ion and s t ream l in ing o f expenditures. During the JCSS period, 
assuming the reforms ou t l ined in the CDS are implemented, g r ow t h i s expected t o 
average 5 percent supported m a i n l y by a recove ry o f the g o l d sector and continued 
g r ow t h in services. G r ow t h in external aggregate demand fueled by continued ben ign 
economic conditions in ne ighbo r ing Russia, Kazakhstan and Ch ina w o u l d he lp ma in ta in 
export g r ow t h and the f l o w o f remittances. Acce le ra t ion o f export g r ow t h should he lp 
reduce the external current account de f ic i t . ' 

73. 
The debt sustainability analysis suggests that debt ra t ios are l i k e l y t o imp rove 
over time. However, this w i l l take place gradually, despite the Government 's decision 
n o t t o seek H I P C debt re l ie f , assuming that macroeconomic targets can be ma in ta ined and 
crucially, that structural reforms fac i l i ta te g r ow t h o f GDP and government revenues. I t i s 
estimated that using data f o r the end o f 2006, the N P V o f debt t o government revenues 
had already declined t o 240 percent (be low the H I P C e l i g i b i l i t y threshold). Nevertheless 
the debt ou t look remains highly vulnerable t o exogenous shocks o r reversal o f the 
prudent macroeconomic po l ic ies . 

74. 
In the event o f strong imp lemen ta t ion o f structural re fo rms i t i s possible that high 
p roduc t iv i ty growth-stemming 
f rom improvements in resource e f f ic iency that result 
f r om correcting re la t ive p r ice d is to r t ions and improvements in the business climate-will 
p rov ide additional stimulus t o output g r ow t h and non -go ld exports. Re fo rms that are 
envisaged t o p romo te d ive rs i f ica t ion and boost long - te rm competitiveness inc lude (i) 
developing the necessary in f ras t ruc tu re t o support p r iva te sector ac t iv i ty pa r t icu la r ly in 
the area o f trade and agriculture; (ii) reduc ing regu la to ry bu rden o n the p r iva te sector;

the strongest component o f the K y r g y z Republic’s economy and shou ld rema in an 
impo r tan t focus area f o r the future.It i s also the mos t impo r tan t sector because o f i t s 
essential r o l e in p r o v i d i n g employment, food security and consumer p r ice stability. Since 
1996 , the ag r icu l tu ra l sector has been characterized by a reduc t ion in subsistence food 
orientation and the emergence o f comme rc ia l ly oriented peasant farms. These sma l l 
f am i l y farms have been the engine o f agricultural growth, and in a supportive p o l i c y and 
pub l ic investment environment their con t r ibu t ion cou ld increase further. 

76 . 

There i s considerable but la rge ly unexp lo i ted po ten t ia l f o r the development o f 
agri-businesses in food, cash crops and ho r t icu l tu ra l processing, and in inputs f o r light 
industry. This w i l l requ i re d ive rs i f ica t ion towards high value-added p roduc t ion and a 
w ide r range o f better qua l i ty processed products. The Government has ou t l ined various 
po l ic ies fo r p romo t ing ag r icu l tu ra l development, i n c l u d i n g measures t o strengthen p r iva te 
p rope r ty r i g h t s in land ownership and fac i l i ta t ing the sale and use o f land as collateral. 
I r r iga t ion services and water resource management w i l l l i k e l y be decentralised and 
privatised t o loca l use rs . Experience suggests that f a rm e r s and l o c a l communities are 
w i l l i n g and capable t o assume respons ib i l i ty fo r many aspects o f loca l development. The 
g row ing r o l e o f Wa te r U s e r s ’ Associations (WUAs) in i r r i g a t i o n and the response o f 
fa rme rs t o opportunities p rov ided by the fo rma t ion o f service cooperatives are further 
evidence o f that w i l l ingness and capacity. Recent sector studies12 have underscored the 
importance o f a v igo rous development o f the non - fa rm r u r a l economy. 

77 . M a j o r reforms are s t i l l needed in the utility sector t o put i t o n a sound f inanc ia l 
footing. T h e K y r g y z Repub l ic has considerable energy resources. 
I t s hydroelectric 
resources are o f the order o f 26,000 M W o f w h i c h o n l y about 10 percent i s exploited; i t 
also has coal reserves in the order o f 1.2 b i l l i o n tons. In addition, the coun t ry has a 
developed e lec t r ic i ty transmission and d is t r ibu t ion system that has ensured that 100 
percent o f the popu la t ion has access t o electricity. 
Premised u p o n progress in 
implementing the Government’s energy sector reforms, i t m a y attract Fo re ign D i rec t 
Investments (FDIs) t o finance construction o f new hyd roe lec t r ic stations and transmission 
l ines t o po ten t ia l expo r t markets in South Asia. The f i r s t step in tapp ing this po ten t ia l 
w i l l be t o undertake the f inanc ia l and technical rehab i l i ta t ion o f the domestic e lec t r ic i ty 
sector t o restore i t s v i a b i l i t y . The energy companies have accumulated a huge amount o f 
debt-leading 
t o a quasi-fiscal de f ic i t amoun t ing t o 7 .6 percent o f GDP in 2005-that 
needs t o b e resolved. Ac t ions t o reduce losses b o t h f inanc ia l and technical, and imp rove 
cash collections-through 
a comb ina t ion o f p o l i c y and investment measures-will 
be 
necessary t o attract the considerable f inanc ing that large p ro jec ts w i l l require. C r i t ica l 
actions in the CDS p e r i o d that focus o n f inanc ia l rehab i l i ta t ion o f the sector cou ld l a y the

T o take better advantage o f the po ten t ia l o f the country’s m ine ra l resources,

Government t o resolve con f l ic ts over p o l i c y are essential, so that w h i l e there m a y be 
divergent opinions, coherent p o l i c y fo rma t ion i s s t i l l made possible. Mechanisms also 
need t o be put in place f o r translation o f government p o l i c y choices i n t o law, ensure that 
the laws and regulations are re la t ive ly unambiguous and non-contradictory, and that the 
state has mo re e f fec t ive mechanisms fo r imp lemen t ing them. 

85. 
Since independence, the Government o f the K y r g y z Repub l ic has struggled with 
vested 
interests, pa r t icu la r ly those o f h igh - rank ing o f f ic ia ls w h o systematically 
undermined ownership o f reforms. Pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion r e f o rm that threatened the 
powe r patronage and ren ts o f senior o f f ic ia ls was systematically opposed and 
manipulated. S im i l a r l y re fo rms in the energy sector were also unde rm ined and opposed 
by o f f ic ia ls . To fight and reduce corruption, the Government needs t o begin t o confront 
these entrenched interests, eliminate the ambiguities and a rb i t ra ry powe rs delegated t o 
I t also needs t o effectively separate economic and p o l i t i c a l interests o f the 
o f f ic ia ls . 
many senior o f f ic ia ls in some o f the key sectors o f the economy, i n c l u d i n g pa r t icu la r ly 
powe r generation, banking, go ld mining, and transport and communications. In this 
respect transparency in these sectors w i l l be fundamental, but w i l l have l i t t l e impac t 
unless there i s strong p o l i t i c a l w i l l t o oppose vested interests and ensure that ind iv idua l 
ministers, members o f Parliament and other h igh - rank ing o f f i c i a l s are n o longer able to 
oppose changes that threaten the i r o w n bus iness in te res ts . 

86. 
One o f the k e y tasks go ing fo rwa rd i s ensuring transparency and accountability o f 
the c i v i l service. The Government has begun t o imp lemen t the lega l f ramewo rk f o r 
compe t i t ive and merit-based appointments t o the c i v i l service. An impo r tan t aspect w i l l 
be t o ensure that due process i s fo l lowed in a l l appointments and dismissals. Another 
impo r tan t step in p romo t ing accountability w i l l b e the pub l ish ing o f income and assets 
declarations by high l e v e l state o f f ic ia ls in the mass media.

Reso lv ing many o f the d i f f icu l t ies o f budget execution w i l l reduce rent-seeking

94. 

Clearly, greater progress needs t o b e made o n poverty-related hea l th issues . In 
add i t ion there are reg iona l disparities across the coun t ry in service u t i l i z a t i o n and access 
t o a f fo rdab le medicines, exacerbated by the increase in out-of-pocket expenses as a share

95. 

The K y r g y z Repub l ic i s on-track t o achieve the MDGs in education. However, 
several hurdles remain, inc lud ing l im i t e d f inanc ing f o r education, ine f f ic ienc ies in the use

Cu r r icu lum mode rn iza t ion i s a p re -cond i t ion f o r im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f 
education. The development and imp lemen ta t ion o f a revised cu r r icu lum requires a new

the aging o f the teaching corps, the i n a b i l i t y o f the system t o p rov ide adequate in-service 
training, outdated teaching techniques and lea rn ing assessments and the l im i t e d use o f

E a r l y re fo rms in the social p ro tec t ion system inc luded the in t roduc t ion o f a

V. THE JOINT COUNTRY SUPPORT STRATEGY 

A. The Strategic F ramewo rk 

108. 

The JCSS assistance i s closely aligned w i th the Government’s development 
goals. JCSS partners w i l l continue t o assist the Government t o translate the CDS i n t o 
clear p r io r i t ies within a credible med ium - te rm expenditure f ramewo rk and annual budget. 
Development partners w i l l s t r i v e to enhance coun t ry ownership and capacity. A l l 
analytic and lend ing support w i l l b e scrutinized t o assess h o w i t achieves the goal o f 
greater ownership, i f i t can be produced j o i n t l y o r h o w others’ w o r k can b e leveraged. 

109. 

One area with considerable po ten t ia l f o r enhancing a i d effectiveness th rough 
better cooperation includes the ha rmon iza t ion o f f iduc ia ry requirements, e.g., common 
procurement arrangements, documents and procedures, a long with common accounting, 
repo r t ing and aud i t ing arrangements. Es tab l ish ing p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion units t o 
manage f iduc ia ry arrangements and secretariats o f p a i d consultants within government 
structures t o develop and implement po l ic ies has fa i led t o build sustainable capacity 
within the administration, w h i l e attracting away the mos t po ten t ia l ly capable o f f ic ia ls . 
Further, coun t ry systems w i l l be used t o the extent possible and partners w i l l w o r k t o 
build and strengthen coun t ry capacity. 

110. 

The JCSS partners w i l l channel the i r assistance through poo led f inanc ing 
arrangements, where favorable p o l i c y frameworks are in place. Project a id w i l l be used 
t o support capacity building and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening, commun i ty -d r iven in i t ia t ives 
and support fo r infrastructure investments. A l l p ro jec t aid, except that channeled th rough 
Non -gove rnmen ta l Organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies w i l l be recorded e x p l i c i t l y o n 
budget. 

1 1 1. 

In a sma l l coun t ry with heavy donor presence, “bus iness as usual” puts a strain 
o n the l im i t e d resources available. Some donors might consider reduc ing their presence 
in some sectors, o r become silent partners, Le., continue t o p rov ide resources but giving 
the leadership t o another donor, within an agreed a id framework. The Government has 
signaled i t s desire t o do this; a good start has b e e n made in the Hea l th SWAp, with o n - 
budget f inanc ing f r o m five donors. A l l JCSS partners w i l l be p roac t ive across the entire 
donor commun i ty t o encourage further se lec t iv i ty and harmonization. Furthermore, the 
five JCSS partners w i l l encourage other donors t o j o i n the j o i n t strategy process. 

112. 

The JCSS partners w i l l continue t o support p o l i c y analysis and engage in 
dialogue t o h e l p the Government p r io r i t ize expenditures and r e f o rm po l ic ies t o mo re 
r a p i d l y achieve CDS goals. The m i x o f instruments used by JCSS partners w i l l inc lude 
s t ra igh t fo rwa rd repeater projects and other investments, supported w i t h targeted technical 
assistance and ana ly t ica l services. The JCSS partners w i l l adapt the leve l and nature o f 
support in response t o emerging national developments and needs, tak ing a f lex ib le 
approach to p r o v i d i n g assistance. These adjustments w i l l b e made in consultation with 
the Government and other partners. An annual JCSS rev iew process w i l l p rov ide the 
oppo r tun i ty t o i d e n t i f y and agree o n any changes. 

30 

113. 
A l l projects w i l l inc lude components t o strengthen governance, transparency and 
accountability. 
In p rac t ica l terms this cou ld mean that sector projects cou ld o n l y go 
forward after an analysis o f the imp l ica t ions fo r ove ra l l governance ( inc lud ing f iduc ia ry 
risk) has been made and shown t o be positive-in 
add i t ion t o the analysis o f the other 
benefits o f the project. Using a governance lens approach also requires that donors b e 
w i l l ing t o say n o t o reques ts f o r assistance that m a y undermiqe ove ra l l governance. T h i s 
also extends t o supporting re fo rms fo r w h i c h the foundations are n o t in place; donors 
should h o l d back i f there are n o clear signals ind ica t ing government owne rsh ip o f re fo rm , 
and seek t o scale up where strong support and a pos i t ive track reco rd i s evident. 

114. 
The p u b l i c and contentious debate ove r H IPC within the coun t ry highlights the 
need f o r deve lop ing an in fo rma t ion dissemination and communications e f fo r t that w i l l 
imp rove the c red ib i l i ty o f the Government and the international donors. Skepticism 
about a r e f o rm process that has l i t t l e leg i t imacy among the broader p u b l i c w i l l reduce the 
chances o f success and fo r building owne rsh ip o f the r e f o rm agenda. T h i s approach 
might mean go ing beyond the consultation process with c i v i l society t o a mo re sustained 
and long - te rm commun ica t ion e f fo r t , i n c l u d i n g mo re e f fec t ive w o r k i n g with the na t iona l 
media, and w i t h commun ica t ion units within Government. 

B. Program Focus 

115. 
The JCSS partners w i l l focus the i r programs o n four areas identified in the CDS 
as especially impo r tan t fo r ach iev ing the ove ra rch ing goals. These are: 

0 Econom ic management consistent w i th strong and sustained p ro -poo r g row th : 
strengthening the budget process and cross-cutting re fo rms in p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management, and a l ign ing f inanc ia l management w i t h government p r io r i t ies ; 
Reduc ing corruption, 
im p r o v i n g governance and e f fec t ive p u b l i c 
administration: deregulating the economy, increasing transparency, im p r o v i n g 
the capacity o f the c i v i l service and p u b l i c administration, and lega l reform; 
0 Building sustainable human and social capital through imp roved hea l th and 
education outcomes, i n c l u d i n g access t o and im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f health, 
education and social p ro tec t ion services; and 
Ensuring environmental sustainability and natural resource management

and expenditure t rack ing surveys. Such support w i l l extend t o strengthening the f inanc ia l 
system and imp rove access 
t o finance 
f o r small and m e d i um enterprises, and 
mode rn iza t ion o f the payments system. 

117. 

T h e JCSS w i l l support the adoption and imp lemen ta t ion o f a n ew tax code that 
removes ambiguities and contradictions and fosters a business f r i e n d l y regu la to ry 
environment. JCSS partners w i l l support the Government t o imp lemen t leg is la t ion aimed 
at reduc ing the number o f technical regulations and manda to ry standards and in t roduce 
limits o n the number and du ra t ion o f inspections. S t ream l in ing l icens ing and permit 
procedures and in t roduc ing mechanisms f o r r e v i ew i n g new regulations w i l l also be 
necessary. These actions w i l l b e conducive t o p romo t ing increased p r iva te sector 
ac t iv i ty . 

118. 
The JCSS partners w i l l support the imp lemen ta t ion o f the agriculture sector 
strategy and the development o f ru ra l aux i l ia ry services. Programs w i l l imp rove 
l ives tock p roduc t iv i ty , enhance ma rke t ing systems and imp rove l a n d registration. 
Programs w i l l also support the development o f an agro-processing industry fo r export, 
i n c l u d i n g in higher value-added products. Emphasis w i l l b e p laced o n sustainable use o f 
water resources and so i l qua l i ty . T o p romo te ru ra l development m o r e broadly, JCSS 
partners w i l l support sector re fo rms and investments in ru ra l roads, and measures t o 
imp rove access t o ru ra l credit. 

119. 

The JCSS w i l l support the creation o f transparent tariff structures, an imp roved 
lega l and regu la to ry framework, good corporate governance and f inanc ing arrangements 
consistent with cost-recovery that w i l l help attract p r iva te capital i n t o the energy and 
mining sectors. JCSS partners w i l l p rov ide analytical and adv iso ry support; however, i t 
should be recognized that p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t and support across the Government w i l l 
be necessary f o r making sustained progress. 

120. 

The JCSS partners w i l l continue t o p rov ide f inanc ia l and technical support t o the 
transport sector that w i l l fac i l i ta te trade and transit. The support includes the preparation 
o f a transport sector strategy-with 
a focus o n the roads sub-sector-that 
takes i n t o 
account operations and maintenance needs, the p r io r i t iza t ion o f a road ne two rk that 
improves transport corridors, strengthening reg iona l transport linkages, and a re fo rm 
p rog ram f o r road maintenance systems and practices. Support w i l l b e p rov ided f o r

also f o rm pa r t o f JCSS support. The JCSS partners m a y p rov ide assistance in deve lop ing 
the f ramewo rk f o r pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships t o support infrastructure development. 

121. 
The JCSS partners w i l l continue t o p rov ide f inanc ia l and technical support t o 
strengthen the f inanc ia l sector. Technical assistance w i l l focus o n governance, risk 
management, as well as new f inanc ia l products such as hous ing finance and insurance. 
Support w i l l also b e g iven t o increase m ic ro lend ing activities, pa r t icu la r ly in the ru ra l 
areas. 

(ii) Improving Governance, Effective Public Administration and Reducing 
Corruption 

122. 
The JCSS support f o r good governance w i l l focus o n dialogue with Government 
and assistance t o build and strengthen the capacity o f ins t i tu t ions c r i t ica l t o ach iev ing the 
CDS outcomes. The central pillar o f JCSS support f o r governance i s n o t an ambitious 
r e f o rm agenda, but rather a rapid; bo t tom -up push fo r development results. 
T h e 
Government should be seen t o be delivering v is ib le benefits t o citizens in ways that are 
seen t o be transparent and fair. These inc lude c i v i l society, parliament, the med ia and 
loca l government. Some programs w i l l also focus o n increasing voice-including 
that o f 
women, in particular-and accountability. 

123. 
T h e JCSS f inanc ia l support w i l l contribute t o the strengthening o f p u b l i c 
f inanc ia l management (PFM), procurement and accounting. Strengthened P F M and 
reduced co r rup t ion are c r i t ica l fo r development o f the Kyrgyz Repub l ic . The JCSS 
partners w i l l support imp lemen ta t ion o f the N a t i o n a l P F M A c t i o n Plan, with a pa r t icu la r 
focus o n budget reform. 
The JCSS w i l l also support 
f iduc ia ry and budget 
e f f ic iencyh rack ing analyses, and w o r k o n increasing p u b l i c demand 
fo r better 
management and use o f budget finds. 

124. 
The JCSS partners w i l l support the Government in unde r tak ing comprehensive 
j u d i c i a l re fo rm , a c ruc ia l underpinning and foundation for successful development. 
Support w i l l be p rov ided f o r programs that build up the capacity o f judges-including 
o n 
human rights-the 
development o f an e f fec t ive p re - t r ia l supervision process and an 
ove ra l l strengthening o f the courts system. Support m a y also be p rov ided to develop an 
alternative dispute reso lu t ion mechanism t o support a m o r e rap id g r ow t h o f the p r iva te 
sector. 

125. 
The JCSS partners w i l l support improvements in business environment and 
investment climate, w h i c h w o u l d alleviate constraints o n market mechanisms, imp rove 
the e f f ic iency o f a l loca t ion o f resources, and fac i l i ta te p r iva te sector investments i n t o 
p ro f i tab le sectors. Capacity building o f the authorities in economic p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion 
and imp lemen ta t ion w i l l b e c r i t ica l fo r pu rsu ing an open development p o l i c y . T h e JCSS 
partners w i l l support the K y r g y z Republic’s e f fo r ts t o h l l y imp lemen t i t s commitments 
under the p rov is ions o f EITI. Greater transparency in the mining sector and management 
o f prospective mining areas a re considered a p re -cond i t ion o f a mo re mature and 
env i ronmen ta l ly responsible approach to exp lo ra t ion and mining activities.

(iii) Bu i ld ing Sustainable H u m a n and Social C ap i t a l 
126. 
In education, the JCSS partners w i l l support preparation o f the Government’s 
na t iona l human resource strategy that seeks t o link labor market needs t o education and 
training. Other instruments o f support w i l l inc lude investments in pre-school, p r im a r y 
and secondary education that imp rove access, qua l i ty and lea rn ing outcomes, i n c l u d i n g t o 
poo r and vulnerable groups in the population, pa r t icu la r ly in r u r a l areas. A study 
focus ing o n the Government’s p r i o r i t y o f in t roduc ing a 12-year system w i l l be 
undettaken under the ADB’s Second Educa t ion project. 

127. 
I f appropriate, the JCSS partners w i l l w o r k towards deve lop ing a SWAP in the 
education sector that w i l l imp rove f inanc ing o f education th rough a d i f fe ren t approach in 
a l loca t ing resources t o schools, teachers’ salaries and teachers’ t ra in ing . In addition, 
support w i l l be p rov ided t o better target poor, r u r a l and disadvantaged students t o ensure 
un ive rsa l access t o qua l i ty education. The JCSS support w i l l seek t o imp rove in te rna l 
e f f ic iency in the u t i l iza t ion o f limited resources, and link a l l interventions t o results o n 
the ground. 

128. 
The JCSS partners w i l l support Manus Tualimi-a

the JCSS pe r iod and reinforces the directions, achievements and r e s u l t s o f Manus I- 
focus o n popu la t ion invo lvemen t in hea l th issues and the increased emphasis o n social 
mob i l iza t ion t o empower communities t o resolve hea l th needs at the loca l leve l . 
Emphasis in the ongo ing Hea l th SWAP i s also be ing p laced o n reo r ien t ing the p u b l i c 
hea l th system and simultaneously strengthening and in teg ra t ing p r i o r i t y programs such as 
TB, reproductive health, c h i l d health, and HIV and AIDS, t o achieve better hea l th 
outcomes. 

129. 
Support w i l l be p rov ided t o strengthening the r o l e o f the Ministry o f H e a l t h in 
the areas o f hea l th p o l i c y formulation, inter-sector cooperation and donor coordination. 
Given the Government’s comm i tmen t t o increasing the na t iona l budget a l loca t ion t o the 
hea l th sector fr6m 10.6 percent in 2006 t o an op t ima l 13 percent in 2010, and t o 100

130. 
Technical assistance and p o l i c y dialogue support w i l l be p rov ided f o r 
comprehensive pension re fo rm and the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Children’s Code. The 
JCSS partners in tend t o support the development o f a pension r e f o rm strategy consistent 
with fiscal sustainability, the mob i l iza t ion o f p r iva te savings, and long - te rm growth, 
based upon a comprehensive assessment o f alternative options, i n c l u d i n g f o r example, 
greater f l e x i b i l i t y in retirement ages, with appropriate adjustments in benefits o r 
contributions. Other key re fo rms that w i l l be supported inc lude : (a) deve lop ing 
satisfactory leg is la t ion and imp lemen ta t ion o f parametric changes in the pay-as-you-go 
system; (b) adopting and imp lemen t ing a phas ing - in ac t ion plan f o r any pension pillar; 

34 

(c) strengthening pension administration and f inanc ia l management, and (d) pension 
p o l i c y reviews. 

13 1, 
Support t o social assistance reforms-through TA and sector wo rk -w i l l help t o 
develop a m o r e effective and simpler bene f i t structure f o r im p r o v i n g the presently l o w # 
l iv ing standards among the poorest households, w i thou t unde rm in ing incentives fo r s e l f - 
sufficiency. This w i l l also inc lude de f in ing a mo re ca re fu l ly d i f fe ren t ia ted set o f 
eligibility conditions and building an administrative system f o r de l ive r ing benefits t o 
e l i g i b l e households. 

(iv) Env i ronmen ta l Sustainability and N a t u r a l Resources Managemen t 

132. 
The JCSS w i l l support mo re e f fec t ive disaster risk management, where the 
p r i o r i t y l i e s in creating adequate environmental safeguards. JCSS partners w i l l support 
efforts to he lp p o l i c y makers-including 
the en t i re Government m o r e broadly-to 
take 
environment-oriented concerns i n t o consideration i n t o key budget po l ic ies and processes. 

133. 
The JCSS w i l l support new in i t ia t ives in energy conservation and renewable 
powe r p rov is ion , w h i c h presents p rom is ing opportunities in ru ra l areas. Such support 
however, w i l l be p rov ided w i thou t any loss in the u rgency o f further re fo rms in the 
energy sector: the development o f renewable energy cannot be a substitute fo r the weak 
management o f the ex is t ing system in the e lec t r ic i ty sector. The JCSS w i l l also support 
efforts to u t i l i z e the C lean Development Mechanisms (CDM ) t o secure grant funding fo r 
energy e f f ic iency and carbon sequestration activities. 

134. 
The JCSS partners envisages further support t o i r r i g a t i o n mode rn iza t ion that 
goes beyond phys ica l infrastructure ( inc lud ing drainage) remode l ing and extends t o 
mode rn methods o f manag ing and p a y i n g f o r i r r iga t ion supplies. The JCSS partners w i l l 
support continued investment in those areas o f water management-including 
trans- 
boundary water management-where 
the p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk i s w e l l 
defined ( i r r iga t ion rehabilitation, ru ra l water and sanitation) and w i l l support further 
development o f a coherent framework built around the concept o f integrated water 
resource management. 

135. 
The development o f l o c a l capacity fo r the Env i ronmen ta l and Na tu ra l Resources 
Management (ENRM) and related activities (such as ru ra l finance, agro-processing, ru ra l 
extension, etc.) has rightly attracted large and diverse donor support. Capacity building 
needs to rema in close t o the center o f donor assistance-including 
that f r om JCSS 
p a r t n e r s 4 u r i n g the p e r i o d o f the CDS. The detailed structure and evo lu t ion o f that 
assistance i s best l e f t t o i n d i v i d u a l donor agencies and their government and c i v i l society 
partners. 

C . Mon i to r ing and Eva lua t ion 

136. 
JCSS partners and the Government w i l l regu la r ly m o n i t o r and evaluate their 
performance re la t ive t o actions, indicators and targets ou t l ined in the JCSS ma t r ix in 

35 

order t o assess their progress towards ach iev ing CDS goals. M o n i t o r i n g and evaluation 
w i l l take the f o rm o f a j o i n t annual rev iew o f t h e CDS and indicators cou ld include, f o r 
example, increased sector coverage o f j o i n t analytical w o r k and building o n the SWAP 
approach and increasing coverage t o other sectors. T o the extent possible, the rev iew w i l l 
use ex is t ing government processes as the m a i n avenues fo r detailed discussion, dialogue 
and generating in fo rma t ion . These inc lude the CDS m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation 
framework, the national budget, the MTEF and Pub l ic Expenditure Rev iews (PERs). 

137. 
T h e annual report w i l l bring together the r e s u l t s i n c l u d i n g progress, rema in ing 
challenges and the w a y forward, and w i l l b e made available in a t im e l y fashion t o a l l 
stakeholders. The m o n i t o r i n g indicators chosen w i l l also re f lec t the in te rna t iona l ly 
accepted Paris Dec la ra t ion indicators adapted t o the context o f the K y r g y z Republic. 
This w i l l fac i l i ta te debate, discussion and p u b l i c accountability. A j o i n t m i d - t e rm rev iew 
w i l l be undertaken during the JCSS period. 

D. F inanc ing Scenarios 

138. 
App rox ima te ly US$80 m i l l i o n pe r annum w i l l b e available f r om the JCSS 
partners; there w o u l d b e a m i x o f instruments i n c l u d i n g budget support (possibly in the 
f o rm o f Deve lopmen t Program Grants), and an investment p rog ram with a m i x o f 
s t ra igh t fo rwa rd repeater projects and other “simple” 
investments along with mo re 
complex p o l i c y oriented projects, supported with targeted TA and analytical services. 
Should the K y r g y z Repub l ic successfully undertake r a p i d re fo rms (s ign i f ican t ly 
addressing governance and business c l ima te issues, etc.,) consideration w o u l d be given- 
consistent with the Performance Based A l l o c a t i o n (PBA ) me thodo logy o f the WBG and 
ADB-to 
increasing IDA and ADB allocations and the greater use o f budget support 
instruments (e.g., Pove r ty Reduc t ion Support Grants (PRSGs) o r Program Development 
credits/grants. A Development F o r um mee t ing i s p lanned f o r M a y 3 1,2007. 

139. 
Jo in t p o l i c y dialogue o n structural re fo rms between the donor commun i ty and 
the Government has generally been good and i s imp rov ing . Opportunities f o r the JCSS 
donors t o engage in dialogue occurs around p ro jec ts and programs and includes sub- 
sector and sector dialogue (where progress has been greater) and dialogue o n m a j o r 
structural re fo rms (where there has been less progress t o date). 

E. Risk M i t ig a t ion 

140. 
Va r ious factors m a y pu t the imp lemen ta t ion o f the JCSS at risk. The s ign i f ican t 
r i s k s can b e categorized i n t o p o l i t i c a l risk, ins t i tu t iona l and operational risk, and the r isks 
f r om exogenous shocks. The r i s k s and the i r m i t i g a t i o n mechanisms are summarized in 
the paragraphs that f o l l ow . 

36 

(i) Po l i t ica l Risk 

141, 
Con t inu ing p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty and upheaval and other adverse events m a y 
h inde r the Government’s comm i tmen t t o imp lemen t the re fo rms supported by the JCSS, 
inc lud ing possible changes in the p o l i t i c a l leadership. The existence o f vested in te res ts in 
k e y sectors m a y also b l o c k reforms. 
In add i t ion there i s a s ign i f ican t risk that the 
authorities m a y move away f r om a ma rke t based approach t o economic p o l i c y t o a mo re 
in te rven t ion is t approach. Skep t ic ism o f the IFI’s m a y also result in the K y r g y z Repub l ic 
turning t o non - t rad i t iona l development partners, thus rendering the support o f the JCSS 
irrelevant and ine f fec t ive . 

142. 

P o l i t i c a l risk can be m i t iga ted in the f o l l ow i n g ways: 

0 By opening a dialogue with the d i f fe ren t branches o f p ow e r o n the obstacles 
t o implementing the r e f o rm agenda o f the CDS; when requested, p r o v i d i n g 
capacity building t o he lp the Government t o build mechanisms t o resolve 
con f l ic ts over po l icy ; 
0 By helping t o imp rove governance and accountability; building o n lessons 
f r om past experience and embedding governance elements i n t o programs; 
By helping the Government and c i v i l society build broader and deeper 
ownership o f the re fo rms th rough tramparent and wide consultations; and 
By ra is ing awareness o f the JCSS among parliamentarians and c i v i l society 
and l is ten ing t o the i r concerns o n the r e f o rm process; and 
B y imp lemen t ing an effective commun ica t ion strategy f o r the JCSS partners, 
and by the w ide r donor commun i ty . 

(ii) Ins t i tu t iona l and Ope ra t iona l Risk 

143. 
The lack o f imp lemen ta t ion capacity m a y unde rm ine the impac t o f the JCSS; 
implementing i t requires substantial changes in behav io r at a l l levels o f government, and 
at the ind iv idua l , organizational and ins t i tu t iona l levels. Limited economic resources 
m a y also s im i la r ly impac t imp lemen ta t ion o f reforms. 

144. 
These r i s k s can be m i t iga ted by ongo ing and proposed interventions and build 
u p o n successes generated in specific areas, inc lud ing : 

Supporting the Government in re ta in ing qua l i f ied personnel and meritocracy;

PART 11. THE WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. 
The JCSS supports the K y r g y z Repub l ic ’s e f fo r ts t o meet the targets set ou t in the 
Government’s CDS f o r the pe r iod 2007-2010 and make progress towards ach iev ing the 
MDG s . 
2. 
T h e WBG p rog ram contributes t o the strategic goals and outcomes ou t l ined in the 
JCSS, and focuses o n supporting the Government’s e f fo r ts t o imp rove the environment 
f o r business and economic g row th and imp rove the qua l i ty o f and access t o basic services 
(health, education, water and sanitation). A c h i e v i n g the outcomes in the Results 
F ramewo rk depends o n im p r o v i n g governance at a l l levels, reduc ing co r rup t ion and 
strengthening the state’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity. T h e challenge, f o r the B a n k and other 
donors, i s in finding e f fec t ive ways t o support the Government in a t im e o f p o l i t i c a l 
upheaval and uncertainty. 
3. 
The need f o r donors t o presen t a j o i n t pos i t ion t o the i r c l ien t i s greater n o w than 
ever. The new Government i s under pressure t o deliver, and the development commun i ty 
i s struggling t o w o r k ou t h o w best t o p rov ide support w i thou t overburdening the 
administration. The JCSS i s a f i r s t step to further ha rmon iza t ion efforts. 

11. IMPLEMENTAT ION OF THE LAST CAS 

4 . 

T h e 2003 C A S was aligned with the areas o f focus described in the Government’s 
NPRS, with s ign i f ican t attention t o pove r ty reduction. T h e C A S p r i o r i t y areas included: 
supporting p r iva te sector l e d growth, stemming the deterioration in k e y infrastructure and 
social services and f i n a l l y addressing governance constraints t o g row th and pove r ty 
reduction. A C A S Comp le t ion Report (CASCR ) f o r the 2003 C A S was prepared in 
February 2007 (Annex 2). T h e C A S performance i s ra ted as satisfactory. 
T o date, the K y r g y z Repub l ic has made good progress o n economic reform, 
despite the fact that there was n o clear m a j o r i t y in favo r o f reform, due t o the centralized 
dec is ion -mak ing process. M o s t notably, the K y r g y z Repub l ic has l ibe ra l ized price, 
fo re ign exchange and trade regimes and has ins t i tu ted a generally equitable land - re fo rm 
agenda, i n c l u d i n g transferring about 60 percent o f the land t o p r iva te ownership, w h i c h i s 
n ow available f o r ren t o r sale. Despite this progress the K y r g y z economy remains f rag i le 
w i t h l o w l iv ing standards, high leve l o f co r rup t ion and debt. 
6. 
The ove ra l l effectiveness o f the Bank’s FY 0 3 - 0 6 p rog ram was pos i t ive . 
Considerable progress was made in ach iev ing the ove ra rch ing C A S objective o f pove r ty 
reduction. A l l C A S supported NPRS targets have seen a ma rked imp rovemen t with the 
exception o f health. Poverty-measured using consump t ion expend i tu res -dec l ined

7. 
The Bank’s support t o the K y r g y z Repub l ic in the areas o f health, education and 
social protection, has been complemented by the commun i ty d r i v e n development 
approach inc lud ing p r o v i d i n g assistance f o r ru ra l water supply and sanitation, sma l l t o w n 
infrastructure, rehab i l i ta t ion o f powe r and d is t r ic t hea t ing systems, and u rban transport 
and maintenance. 
The second Hea l th R e f o rm p ro jec t was c r i t ica l in building ins t i tu t ions necessary 
t o enable the Ministry o f Hea l th t o func t ion as a steward o f the sector rather than an 
implementer. The IDA’S convening r o l e i s evident in the exemplary co l labo ra t ion among 
donors w h i c h l e d t o the success o f the re fo rm p rog ram and n o t just the p ro jec t itself. 
Pa r t ly due t o close coordination, 
the current 
IDA -suppo r ted operation 
i s be ing 
implemented under a SWAP w h i c h 
includes donor support 
fo r 
f inanc ing o f 
recurrent/operational costs and efforts t o harmonize procedures and strengthen f iduc ia ry 
systems in the health sector. 
9 . 
Under the Ru ra l Educa t ion project, new student and class achievement t rack ing 
instruments have been developed and 100 fe l lowsh ips f o r ru ra l teachers have been 
created, Schools in tw o p i l o t regions are be ing trained in new s k i l l s and ab i l i t ies o f j o i n t 
strategic planning fo r school development with engagement o f school staff, parents and 
boards o f trustees. The WBG and ADB, whose education projects share the same goals, 
comm i t ted to ’move towards a j o i n t p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion unit w i t h i n 2007. 
10. 
IDA operations in the agriculture sector have been e x p l i c i t l y aimed at im p r o v i n g 
the operating environment f o r p r iva te f a rm e r s and agri-businesses and at re focus ing the 
p u b l i c sector o n p o l i c y and enabling functions in a ma rke t economy. Some 7 0 percent o f 
farm land i s n ow p r iva te ly owned as a result o f the generally equitable l a n d re fo rm , 
supported by the Ag r icu l tu ra l Services Support p ro jec t (ASSP). The ins t i tu t iona l , 
operational and p o l i c y f ramewo rk presented in the mu l t i -componen t ASSP has a l lowed a 
number o f other donors (e.g., DffD, TAC IS , SIDA and UNDP ) t o attach, the i r related 
operations t o this project. 
1 1. 
T h e IDA - f inanced L a n d and Rea l Estate Reg is t ra t ion p ro jec t has been successful 
in increasing land tenure security, im p r o v i n g access t o investment capital and mo re 
e f f ic ien t use o f land and rea l estate assets, stemming f rom an e f f ic ien t system f o r land 
and rea l estate transactions. These r e s u l t s are impressive given that a transparent land 
and real estate market did n o t exist p r i o r t o the p ro jec t approval in 2000. Access t o credit 
has improved-the 
numbe r and value o f mortgages have increased, with over 40,000 
mortgages valued at m o r e than US$418 m i l l i o n equivalent registered during 2005 alone. 
12. 
Empowerment o f l o c a l commun i t ies has progressed w e l l th rough the in t roduc t ion 
o f commun i ty driven in i t ia t ives in several areas, no tab ly th rough the Bank’s V i l l a g e 
Investment Project (V IP ) and On -Fa rm I r r i g a t i o n Project (OIP). Unde r the On-farm 
I r r i g a t i o n project, water u s e r association (WUA) creation, registration, and strengthening 
continue. A t the end o f 2006 ,436 WUA’s have been lega l ly registered, serving 710,000 
h a ou t o f the developed area o f 1.1 m i l l i o n ha. T h e WUA concept has n o w been fully 
accepted in the coun t ry and the founda t ion i s l a i d f o r sustainable WUA development in 
the future. The Bank ’s V I P has been h a v i n g a ma jo r impac t o n governance at the loca l 
leve l , 
rap id ly spreading and 
ins t i tu t iona l iz ing concepts and practices such as 
transparency, c i t izen involvement, and p u b l i c accoun tab i l i ty (Box 1).

The Government’s reco rd o n and comm i tmen t t o im p r o v i n g governance has been 
re la t ive ly weak. Measures t o increase efficiency, transparency and f iduc ia ry controls 
w i t h i n the p u b l i c sector have proceeded reasonably w e l l at the techn ica l l e v e l (through 
the development o f the Treasury, e l im ina t ion o f many special means accounts and extra- 
budgetary funds, im p r o v e d c lass i f ica t ion and reporting), but there was n o comm i tmen t t o 
tackle core p o l i c y re fo rms . In retrospect i t was clear that there was n o ownership o f

reforms w h i c h w o u l d threaten vested interests in d i f fe ren t areas. Pub l ic administration 
re fo rms w h i c h affected the power, patronage and rents o f senior o f f ic ia ls were 
undermined. T h i s ho lds t r u e pa r t icu la r ly f o r structural re fo rms in the energy sector for 
example. The NPRS recognized the importance o f the reduc t ion o f losses (much o f 
w h i c h were due t o organized the f t by o f f ic ia ls ) and the need t o have a m e d i um te rm t a r i f f 
p o l i c y so that investment needs cou ld b e covered. During the pe r iod o f the NPRS, n o 
progress was made o n these issues. 
14. 
Fa i lu re t o increase e lec t r ic i ty ta r i f fs and an increase in comme rc ia l and technical 
losses t o around 43 percent by 2004, meant that the Government’s objective o f f inanc ia l 
v iab i l i ty , operational e f f ic iency and p r iva te investment in the energy u t i l i t ies was n o t 
achieved. Parliamentary elections at the beginning o f 2005 were a one reason why the 
Government deferred i t s planned t a r i f f increases, w h i c h were also p o l i t i c a l l y d i f f i c u l t in 
the pe r iod f o l l ow i n g the change o f Government. 
In add i t ion i t i s recognized that 
entrenched rent seeking and interests within the energy sector have meant that 
Government commitments t o re fo rm have o f ten n o t been carried out. As a result, the 
Bank’s G S AC f a c i l i t y was closed be fo re the third and f i n a l tranche was released. 
The authorities have recen t ly developed and made some progress in imp lemen t ing 
a focused ac t ion p l a n t o strengthen p u b l i c finance management. Th is w o r k i s supported 
by a l l development partners and i s based o n the (PEFA) findings. The ac t ion plan 
recognizes that the p r i o r i t y i s t o deal with a few basic issues w h i c h w i l l a l l ow spending 
agencies t o imp lemen t their budgets in a predictable w a y and w i th a so l id in te rna l con t ro l 
framework. 
The Bank has supported this w o r k under the p rog ramma t ic p u b l i c 
expenditure rev iew (PPER), w h i c h has focused o n p r o v i d i n g p rac t ica l technical 
assistance t o the authorities. 
T h e Bank has also been supporting the j u d i c i a l system th rough an IDF grant 
w h i c h has enabled the development o f a court i n f o rm a t i o n and management system. This

system. 
T h e IFC projects in the f inanc ia l sector, mining, agribusiness and manu fac tu r ing 
have been successful, however, a l l have faced d i f f icu l t ies as a resu l t o f i s s u e s related t o 
the business environment and the absence o f reg iona l cooperation w h i c h limits ma rke t 
opportunities for and thus the economic v i a b i l i t y o f K y r g y z enterprises. Projects 
generally requ i re significant 
levels o f technical assistance t o ensure the economic 
v i a b i l i t y and long - te rm sustainability o f I F C investments.

that has created m u l t i p l e layers and high adm in is t ra t ive barriers, driving economic 
ac t iv i ty outside the formal sector. Inadequate investments in maintenance o f phys ica l 
infrastructure, i n c l u d i n g transport and communications, have constrained the g r ow t h o f

The absence o f p r iva t iza t ion o f energy and infrastructure projects as w e l l as a

obstacles t o increased fo re ign and I F 1 investment in these sectors.

111. SUMMARY OF LESSONS LEARNED 

22. 

23. 

21. 

Greater se lec t iv i ty i s needed g iven the l im i t e d IDA resources and the l im i ta t ions 
p laced o n the Government’s o w n PIP. 
In this respect, the WBG strategy focuses o n 
building o n successful results achieved in f i r s t generation projects, targeting ac t iv i t ies 
where the B a n k can show v is ib le results t o the population, and leve rag ing ou r lend ing 
and analytical w o r k t o attract f inanc ing f r om other development partners. The Bank 
programs in the K y r g y z Repub l ic shou ld assume a sequenced and long - te rm approach t o 
development challenges and re f lec t this in i t s operations focus ing o n basics be fo re 
attempting mo re comp lex reforms. 
An impo r tan t lesson learned i s that p o l i c y r e f o rm o f the governance and 
ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk o f ten takes longe r than expected. There are m a n y reasons fo r 
this, inc lud ing the l im i ta t ions o f the country’s imp lemen ta t ion capacity, the absence o f 
prerequisites fo r sustained and durable reform, and the t im e l a g between altered 
incentives and behavioral response. Exogenous factors can de lay implementation, but 
there are ve ry few that can accelerate change. Expectations, and related performance 
indicators, o n the pace o f re fo rm and response t o r e f o rm should re f lec t that experience. 
Project and p rog ram cond i t iona l i t ies rema in impo r tan t but have p roven t o b e a 
blunt instrument in persuading the Government t o carry ou t m a j o r ins t i tu t iona l (and 
pa r t icu la r ly governance) reforms where s ign i f ican t vested interests remain. The Bank 
intends t o m o v e away f r om development p o l i c y operations w i th cond i t iona l i ty in 
exchange for budget support towards focused technical assistance and investment with 
concrete results. The use o f instruments l i k e Development P o l i c y Lend ing o r Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Support Credits (PRSCs) as a leve r f o r change needs t o be reconsidered in the 
context o f the K y r g y z Republic. T h e reluctance o f the authorities t o pa r t ic ipa te in the 
H I P C and MDRI in i t ia t ives also indicates the poo r chances o f success f o r development 
p o l i c y operations. A t temp ts should b e made t o build consensus f o r r e f o rm th rough non - 
lend ing activities, and supporting the re fo rms that are already o n the Government’s ow n 
agenda. 
F o r this reason the Bank’s lend ing p rog ram f o r FY07 -10 includes p r im a r i l y 
investment lending. Tha t be ing said, the pos i t ive experience o f imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
Hea l th SWAP needs t o be continued, supported by further capacity building in the area o f 
p u b l i c expenditure management. B roaden ing the consultative process and mu l t i -dono r

take a programmatic approach with a focus o n results, t o ensure the amount o f f inanc ia l 
support i s commensurate with rea l progress t o support long - te rm re fo rms and ins t i tu t ion 
building. 
25. 
One o f the mos t impo r tan t achievements during the FY 0 3 - 0 6 C A S pe r iod was 
imp roved donor coo rd ina t ion and harmonization. T h i s was seen pa r t icu la r ly f o l l ow i n g 
the change in Government in M a r c h 2005 when donors came together w i th one vo ice t o 
p rov ide support t o the new Government and help q u i c k l y i d e n t i f y development priorities. 
Greater ha rmon iza t ion has also translated i n t o the development o f a j o i n t coun t ry support 
strategy as we l l as the preparation o f j o i n t projects, such as the Hea th SWAP and j o i n t 
Technical Assistance (TA) in Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management (PFM) re fo rm . 

IV . PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE 

26. 
Efforts were made t o imp rove p o r t f o l i o performance during the pe r iod o f the 
previous C A S and as a result there are cu r ren t ly n o projects at risk. T w o o f 19 projects in 
the V I P and L a n d and Rea l Estate 
the p o r t f o l i o are rated as highly satisfactory: 
Registration project. The size o f the Bank’s p o r t f o l i o grew over the last C A S pe r iod f r om 
16 projects in 2003 t o 19 as o f M a r c h 1, 2006. To ta l comm i tmen ts slightly decreased 
f r om almost US$286 m i l l i o n in FY 0 3 
t o US$254.3 m i l l i o n in M a r c h 2006. 
Disbursements have imp roved substantially compared t o the p rev ious C A S period. 
Throughout FY03-05, the disbursement ra t io was consistently h ighe r than the E C A 
average, increasing from around 2 0 percent in F Y 0 3 t o almost 27.5 percent in FY06 .27 
The average p ro jec t age o f 3.8 years i s slightly higher than the E C A average o f 3.4 
years.** 
27. 
CPPRs have evo lved i n t o an e f fec t ive t o o l f o r manag ing p o r t f o l i o performance. 
M o s t systemic issues identified, Le., compliance with procurement, disbursement and 
financial management requirements, have been resolved th rough r e g u l a r CPPRs. T h e 
most recent CPPRs have put a greater emphasis o n results-based approaches in p o r t f o l i o 
management and launched the discussion w i t h the Government o n h o w the p o r t f o l i o 
contributes t o ach iev ing C A S outcomes. In addition, CPPRs focused attention o n mo re 
specific issues , such as taxa t ion o f p ro jec t resources, P I U inspections, and insu f f ic ien t 
coordination o f donors and po r t fo l io by the Government. With respect t o the latter, 
progress i s being made as CPPRs a re n ow being conducted j o i n t l y with other 
development partners, f o r example ADB, IsDB and KW.

M i t i g a t e r i s k s associated with high indebtedness and g row th vo la t i l i ty . T h e JCSS 
iden t i f ies g r ow t h as a p r i o r i t y for pove r ty reduction, but also recognizes the 
constraints in m o v i n g towards a sustainable g r ow t h path. T h e Bank w i l l continue 
t o p rov ide support t o the K y r g y z Repub l ic t o overcome these challenges. 
Focus o n basic reforms, as opposed t o comu lex ouerations: Lessons learned 
among development partners have shown tha t g iven K y r g y z Republic’s unce r ta in

strong comm i tmen t t o fundamental r e f o rm o f the e lec t r ic i ty sector, i n c l u d i n g f o r 
pub l ic /p r iva te partnerships, the Bank w o u l d consider an Ene rgy Loss Reduc t ion

making s ign i f ican t s teps 
towards

f inanc ia l hea l th and 
transparency. 

(ii) Improving Governance, Effective Public Administration and Reducing 
Corruption 
38 . 

Rather than pursuing an ambitious agenda o f governance reforms, the Bank 
intends t o focus o n areas that can achieve rap id development results, with the 
Government be ing seen t o be de l ive r ing visible benefits t o citizens, and do ing so in ways 
that are transparent and fair. Experience has demonstrated that far reach ing ins t i tu t iona l 
re fo rms are neither feasible n o r l i k e l y t o show resu l ts in the short- t o medium-term. 
Governance r e f o rm w i l l be embedded in specific investment operations, i n c l u d i n g 
consideration for capacity enhancement and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening in p u b l i c sector 
counterparts. This w i l l encompass organizational and functional rev iews o f central 
government ministries, as well as efforts t o enhance the capacities o f loca l government. 
Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management and Pub l ic Administration 
The Bank, in close co l labo ra t ion with the other development partners w i l l build 
o n ongo ing w o r k and programs that enhance the na t iona l p u b l i c f inanc ia l management. 
Specifically, support w i l l be p rov ided t o imp lemen t the p u b l i c finance r e f o rm ac t ion p l a n 
adopted in June 2006 to: (i) strengthen mechanisms t o ensure that annual budgets c lea r ly 
reflect CDS p r io r i t ies ; (ii) imp lemen t mechanisms t o enhance expenditure accounting, 
t rack ing and reporting; (iii) develop in te rna l con t ro l system and in t roduce e f fec t ive 
in te rna l audits; and (iv) strengthen p u b l i c procurement. The Banks’ interventions in this 
area w i l l he lp the authorities t o considerably imp roved the P E F A ratings, pa r t icu la r ly in 
the area o f budget execution, measured by P E F A ind ica to r P I -16 and accounting and 
auditing, PI-25. The B a n k i s willing t o support the authorities’ e f fo r ts t o imp rove the 
f inanc ia l transparency o f operations in SOEs and in th is context cou ld p rov ide advice t o 
s t reng then the asset management strategy and he lp guide and sequence government 
reforms. 
In p u b l i c administration reform, the authorities have recen t ly recognized the 
importance o f a merit-based c i v i l service and begun t o imp lemen t the new lega l 
f ramewo rk fo r compe t i t ive and merit-based c i v i l service appointments. Deepening o f 
this process and setting p u b l i c sector remuneration and ensuring that p u b l i c servants 
receive adequate remuneration w i l l take considerable t im e and w i l l requ i re gradual 
imp rovemen t in re fo rm management capacity. The Bank w i l l con t inue t o support

creating a professional c i v i l service th rough technical assistance o n the res t ruc tu r ing and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f new systems o f remuneration in p i l o t p u b l i c agencies. These p i l o t 
programs w i l l b e evaluated and subsequently extended t o the rest o f the p u b l i c sector. 
41. 
The bulk o f the Bank ’s engagement t o support th is CDS goa l w i l l be th rough 
comprehensive AAA ac t iv i ty . T h i s w i l l inc lude the ongo ing PPER, the Coun t ry 
F iduc ia ry Update, an expenditure t rack ing review in k e y social sector service providers, 
and a comprehensive co r rup t ion diagnostic t o be undertaken by the WB I in FY 0 8 . T h e 
Bank’s ongo ing PPER w i l l support economic management by bringing about changes in 
budget performance and mon i to r ing , and con t r ibu t ing t o the dialogue o n spending 
p r io r i t ies . Ongo ing support under ex is t ing operations w i l l support continued capacity 
building in budget management and in te rna l and external audit. 
Imp rov ing the Business Environment 
42. 
An impo r tan t element in the fight against co r rup t ion w i l l b e t o increase the 
momen tum o f deregulation in the economy and reduce the scope f o r rent-seeking 
behavior. T h e Government’s CDS envisages a w i d e range o f re fo rms in tax and customs 
administration, business procedures and l icens ing regulations. The WBG w i l l assist the 
K y r g y z Repub l ic in im p r o v i n g i t s bus iness environment and m o v i n g t o a regu la to ry 
f ramewo rk based u p o n transparent laws, reduc ing inspections and s t ream l in ing license 
requirements and establishing clear and transparent procedures f o r new laws and 
regulations a f fec t ing businesses. In the context o f BEEPS and other pe r iod ic business 
surveys, there w i l l be a close m o n i t o r i n g o f progress in changes in the business 
environment that w i l l guide the ongo ing p o l i c y dialogue. Ongo ing investment operations 
in this area w i l l be l im i t e d t o assisting the authorities in reduc ing technical barriers t o 
entrepreneurship and trade. The IFC ’s adv iso ry services w i l l also seek t o imp rove the 
bus iness environment. Such assistance m a y inc lude surveys o f the business environment 
as v iewed by m i c r o and sma l l bus iness enterprises; re fo rms t o the l icens ing and pe rm i t 
regime; o r w o r k t o limit inspections. 
I F C w i l l also support direct investment i n t o 
manufacturing, 
infrastructure and extractive 
industries w h i c h demonstrate good 
governance, f inanc ia l and economic v i a b i l i t y and environmental sustainability. 
43. Mining (and pa r t icu la r ly gold) i s a s ign i f ican t resource o f the K y r g y z economy. 
The sector n ow accounts fo r 10 percent o f GDP, 1 1 percent o f budget revenues, and over 
40 percent o f exports and i t ho lds considerable po ten t ia l f o r g row th . However, 
conditions for further development o f the sector are hampered by lack o f transparency 
and excessive discretionary au tho r i ty by government agencies as w e l l as a lack o f clear 
v i s i o n concerning the r o l e o f the state mining company (Ky rgyzA l tyn ) . Mining licenses 
(also outside the g o l d sector) remain a source o f rents. Disputes are cu r ren t ly on -go ing 
f o r the licenses f o r the Jerooy and Ta ldybu lak g o l d mines. 
44. 
T h e Bank w i l l assist the authorities in imp lemen ta t ion o f the E IT I t o increase the 
transparency in the mining sector. An appropriate l icens ing and regu la to ry f ramewo rk 
cou ld encourage large investments f o r exp lo i t ing new resources (e.g., g o l d deposits in the 
Jerui mine) and s t imu la t ing economic g row th . An ongo ing p o l i c y dialogue and TA 
p rog ram for r e f o rm o f the basic mining regu la to ry and l icens ing structure w i l l continue 
under the Bank p rog ram t o help the coun t ry con fo rm t o in te rna t iona l practices and 
standards, in pa r t icu la r t o develop a coherent and unambiguous mining code, consistent 

62 

with in te rna t iona l practice. Subject t o the success o f the TA p rog ram t o increase 
transparency in the mining sector, the I F C m a y consider sustainable investments in the 
sector w i t h qua l i f ied p r iva te sector sponsors. 
45. Weak p rope r ty r i g h t s and a lack o f effective mechanisms fo r con f l ic t reso lu t ion 
th rough the j u d i c i a l system inhibit investment, exacerbate co r rup t ion and represent a 
ma jo r constraint t o p r iva te sector operation. Fo re ign investors have faced d i f f icu l t ies in 
en fo rc ing p r iva te p rope r ty r i g h t s in the Kyrgyz R i p u b l i c and have suffered due t o 
in te rven t ion is t actions o f the Government. Ove r the past t w o years, MIGA insured 
investors have experienced difficulties with regards t o the i r investments w h i c h have 
resulted in t w o c la ims situations. MIGA has b e e n active in med ia t ion efforts between the 
investors and the Government t o resolve the disputes and i s w o r k i n g towards f ina l iz ing a 
settlement agreement between the tw o parties in tw o o f i t s projects. 
Ongo ing and fo l low -up operations t o support comp le t ion o f the state cadastre and

imp rove land u s e p lann ing and management are pa r t o f the Bank program. A Jud ic ia l

modernize 
the j u d i c i a l system and 
imp rove i t s effectiveness and transparency. 
Deve lop ing A l te rna t ive Dispute Reso lu t ion Systems f o r example under th is p ro jec t w i l l 
enhance access t o the lega l system, fac i l i ta te contract dispute reso lu t ion and p rov ide

p u b l i c services and broadening the access t o these services f o r a l l members o f society. 
The emphasis w i l l be o n achieving rap id imp rovemen ts in access by the poorer

assistance strategy and w i l l be supported by p u b l i c expenditure t rack ing analysis and 
household expenditure and use r surveys t o evaluate access levels. Furthermore the 
recen t ly approved A v i a n Flu p ro jec t and the Bank ’s engagement (with others) o n 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Na t iona l AIDS strategy w i l l complement the b road sector wide

48. 
The Bank w i l l also continue t o have strong engagement in the education sector. I f

VI. IDA FINANCING AND INSTRUMENTS 

53. 
Bank f inanc ing during f isca l 2007 t o 2010 i s expected t o average about US$35 
m i l l i o n in new commitments annually. T h e s e commitments are balanced across a l l 
p r im a r y CDS goals, although the CDS goal o n environmental sustainability represents the 
smallest area o f Bank engagement. This reflects other donor invo lvemen t , b o t h JCSS and 
n o n JCSS partners, and o f course the need fo r se lec t iv i ty g iven the f i n i t e amount o f 
available IDA resources. Furthermore the Bank w i l l continue t o so l ic i t t r u s t f inds and 
other sources o f funds t o complement b o t h the iden t i f ied TA and the p lanned AAA 
ac t iv i ty . 
54. 
The IDA allocations w i l l be determined annually based u p o n the performance 
based a l loca t ion system, w h i c h includes the Coun t ry P o l i c y and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment 
(CPIA) rating, governance and measures o f annual p o r t f o l i o performance, inc lud ing 
procurement. The K y r g y z Repub l ic had a s l i g h t imp rovemen t in i t s C P I A ra t ing w h i c h i s 
expected t o increase t o 3.6 in 2006, however further imp rovemen t w i l l requ i re very 
strong efforts and achievements in im p r o v i n g performance in areas o f governance, 
p rope r ty r i g h t s and rule-based governance, transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in the pub l ic 
sector and the qua l i ty o f p u b l i c administration. The strong focus o n governance i s s u e s in 
this CAS together with the emphasis o n the de l ive ry o f p u b l i c services w i l l f o rm a so l id 
foundation f o r the p o l i c y dialogue t o imp rove the ove ra l l C P I A ra t ing . 
Lending l im i t s are determined annually based u p o n the I D A 1 4 performance based 
a l loca t ion system, w h i c h in turn depends o n coun t ry performance, i t s performance 
re la t ive t o the performance o f other IDA countries; the amount o f ove ra l l resources 
available t o IDA during the I D A 1 4 and I D A 1 5 replenishment periods; changes in the l i s t 
o f active ID A - e l i g i b l e countries; and the t e rm s (grants o r loans) f o r w h i c h the K y r g y z 
Repub l ic qua l i f ies under the grant e l i g i b i l i t y and a l loca t ion f ramewo rk . T h e K y r g y z 
Repub l ic i s cu r ren t ly characterized as a high risk coun t ry in terms o f debt distress and a l l 
IDA allocations are o n grant t e rm s . 
56. 
There w i l l be a m o v e away f r om general structural budgetary support in this 
assistance strategy, because past experience has shown these instruments t o be l e s s 
effective in the K y r g y z environment given lack o f ownership and weak ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity. T o imp rove the Bank ’s impac t re fo rm efforts w i l l b e addressed th rough sector 
specific investment projects, technical assistance and analytical w o r k where assistance 
can be focused o n fewer issues and a sequenced approach can p r o v i d e f l e x i b i l i t y . This 
w o u l d a l l ow f o r better measurement o f step-by-step imp rovemen ts and f o r timely 
adjustments i f necessary. Sector-wide programs cou ld b e expanded i n t o new areas such 
as education if current arrangements in the hea l th sector continue t o bear fruit and i f the 
f iduc ia ry environment i s conducive.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 

The W o r l d Bank’s 2003 C A S p rog ram was built u p o n the areas o f focus ou t l ined 
in the NPRS with an overarching objective t o support pove r ty reduc t ion in the K y r g y z 
Repub l ic . T h e three p i l la rs o f the country’s pove r ty reduc t ion strategy were: 
the 
Fo rma t ion o f an E f fec t ive State; Building a Fa i r Society; and P romo t ing Sustainable 
Econom ic G row th . The th ree C A S p r i o r i t y areas were: 

Supporting p r iva te sector-led growth, with a focus o n agriculture, industry and energy 
as the m a i n drivers o f growth, and he lp ing develop an enabling business environment 
conducive to sma l l and medium enterprises; 
P rov id ing essential services th rough commun i ty d r iven development initiatives-for 
example, as through the water supply and sanitation project-that 
support l o c a l 
capacity development and investment, and arresting the deterioration 
infrastructure, and 
Strengthening the governance framework: im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency and transparency 
o f the budget process, s t ream l in ing and im p r o v i n g the professionalism o f the c i v i l 
service and helping address governance constraints t o g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion 

in key 

* 

The C A S was approved acknow ledg ing the weaknesses in p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty and 
the r i s k o f economic shocks. However, the strategy did n o t and cou ld n o t have envisaged 
the degree o f p o l i t i c a l and economic d is loca t ion that took place in M a r c h 2005 and the 
f o l l ow i n g years. The p o l i t i c a l situation started t o deteriorate seriously in 2004 and 
culminated in the ove r th row o f President Akaev’s reg ime in M a r c h 2005; con t inu ing 
p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty l e d t o a numbe r o f serious and continuous p o l i t i c a l crises in 2005 and 
2006. These upheavals have had an adverse effect u p o n the K y r g y z economy and the 
a b i l i t y o f the Government t o imp lemen t i t s policies. 

iii. The CAS was over op t im is t ic in assessing the ins t i tu t iona l capab i l i ty and 
technical capacity o f the Government t o implement an ambitious and w ide - rang ing 
r e f o rm program. These d i f f icu l t ies were exacerbated by the fragmentation o f the p o l i t i c a l 
structures before and after the M a r c h 2005 events, i n c l u d i n g the deadlock between the 
Government and the Parliament, m a k i n g the approval and further imp lemen ta t ion o f 
re fo rms very d i f f i c u l t . 

iv. 

The CAS outcomes have been m ixed . Considerable progress was made in 
achieving the overarching C A S ob jec t ive o f pove r ty reduction. G r ow t h performance, 
however, was highly vo la t i le and fragile. CAS-supported NPRS targets f o r social 
indicators have seen ma rked improvement, with the exception o f health, where indicators 
showed some deterioration. Howeve r , this deterioration m a y represent changes in 
repo r t ing o f hea l th statistics-including 
the adoption o f in te rna t iona l ly accepted 
methodologies f o r c om p i l i n g them-and 
the lagged effects o f past unde r - f inanc ing o f the 
hea l th sector. 

76 

v. 
The Government’s reco rd o n and i t s comm i tmen t t o im p r o v i n g governance has 
been ve ry weak. Measures t o increase efficiency, transparency and f iduc ia ry controls 
w i t h i n the p u b l i c sector have proceeded reasonably w e l l at the technical leve l . However, 
comm i tmen t t o tackle core p o l i c y reforms, pa r t icu la r ly w i t h respect t o reduc ing 
co r rup t ion and c i v i l service re fo rm , was weak and supe r f ic ia l under the previous 
Government. 
In retrospect, i t i s clear that there was n o ownership o f reforms and 
p ow e r f u l vested interests p layed a role. Pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion reforms, w h i c h affected the 
power, patronage and rents o f senior officials, were undermined, A number o f structural 
reforms, i n c l u d i n g energy re fo rms in particular, were stalled f o r a number o f years. 

vi. 
Nevertheless there were some achievements imp roved donor coo rd ina t ion and 
harmonization. T h i s progress has translated i n t o the development o f a JCSS and also 
preparation o f j o i n t projects, such as the Hea l th SWAP and j o i n t technical assistance f o r 
p u b l i c f inanc ia l re fo rm . 

vii. 
Impo r tan t lessons were learned during the C A S imp lemen ta t ion and these have 
been considered in the preparation o f the JCSS: 
The r i s k s o f continued p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty suggest h a v i n g a mo re realistic set o f 
expectations w i t h regard t o re fo rm implementation. T h i s imp l ies that mo re modest- 
rather than wide-ranging-reforms 
have a greater chance o f success. 
The fragmented p o l i t i c a l environment also reflects the lack o f consensus that i s 
necessary f o r t r u e coun t ry ownership o f re fo rms . Unde r such circumstances, 
cond i t iona l i ty i s a blunt and less effective instrument f o r m a j o r ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm . 
Experience in the hea l th sector has shown that r e f o rm i n g ins t i tu t iona l arrangements i s 
m u c h mo re feasible when supported by an integrated strategy and sustained 
investment over several years. 
Support f o r p u b l i c finance reform th rough the p rog ramma t ic p u b l i c expenditure 
rev iew demonstrated h o w sustained dialogue and engagement can he lp build 
consensus f o r reform. I t also i l lus t ra ted h o w technical know ledge can be transferred 
better th rough hands-on technical assistance rather than th rough large pieces o f 
economic and sector wo rk . 
Commun i ty driven approaches-such 
as the V i l l a g e Imp rovemen t Project-have 
i l lus t ra ted the opportunities f o r building o n successful re fo rms at the loca l leve l . 
Similarly, targeted interventions-in 
c lea r ly de f ined areas such as land registration- 
are also successful models. 
These commun i ty -d r iven projects have also demonstrated h o w governance 
approaches at the l o c a l leve l can be successfully imp lemen ted and insulated f r om 
p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty at the na t iona l level. 
Future assistance should inc lude ways o f assessing the extent o f t r u e coun t ry 
ownership and take i n t o account the ins t i tu t iona l and technical capacity o f the 
Government t o imp lemen t reforms. C A S imp lemen ta t ion suggests that the mos t 
u s e f u l interventions are those that support basic re fo rms with l im i t e d objectives. 
F ina l ly , the resurgent na t iona l ism and mo re in te rven t ion is t economic approach o f the 
new authorities m a y r e q u i r e a mo re f l e x i b l e economic dialogue, in w h i c h the B a n k

1. 
This Comp le t ion Report rev iews the FY03 -06 C A S f o r the K y r g y z Republic,

I. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC’S LONG TERM GOALS AND OUTCOMES 

A. Strategic Goals 

2. 
In 2001, the K y r g y z Repub l ic prepared an inc lus ive 10-year Comprehensive 
Deve lopmen t F ramewo rk (CDF), w h i c h p rov ided the b road v i s i o n and directions o f i t s 
long - te rm development path. The ove ra rch ing objective o f the C D F was t o achieve 
p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty and social well-being, economic g row th alongside democracy, human 
development and imp roved opportunities f o r a l l citizens o f the K y r g y z Repub l ic . 
3. 
T h e NPRS was the f i rs t phase in imp lemen ta t ion o f the CDF . T h e three p i l la rs o f 
the NPRS were: 
Formation of an Effective State: T h e ove ra l l v is ion in the NPRS was f o r a 
smaller, mo re professional and accountable state apparatus. I t iden t i f ied the need 
t o address corruption, enhance democratic 
ins t i tu t ions and 
imp rove 
the 
effectiveness and integrity o f the state. 
Building a F a i r Society: The NPRS focused o n increasing access t o qua l i ty 
education (pa r t icu la r ly pre-school, p r im a r y and secondary education) in r u r a l 
areas, o n hea l th reforms, emphasizing p r im a r y hea l th care, and o n creating a 
targeted system o f social protection. T h i s was t o b e achieved th rough increasing 
funding f o r human development and greater e f f ic iency and targeting,

Promoting Sustainable Economic Growth: The NPRS envisaged 

the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f structural re fo rms t o support economic g row th . 
Im p r o v i n g 
p roduc t iv i ty in agriculture, i n c l u d i n g agro-processing, was a k e y focus area. 
Other sources o f g r ow t h iden t i f ied were small-scale industry and services 
(telecom, transport, energy, etc.). 

4. 
T h e Boards o f the IMF and IDA considered the NPRS in February 2003, and 
ind ica ted that i t p rov ided an appropriate v i s i o n f o r development, w h i l e emphasizing the 
need f o r further p r io r i t iza t ion . The W o r l d Bank ’s C A S and p rog ram built u p o n the areas 
o f focus ou t l ined in the NPRS . 

B. Progress Towards Achieving Goals 

5 . 

Overall, the borrower’s performance c o u l d b e considered mode ra te ly satisfactory 
during this C A S pe r iod . Government has made m i x e d progress in advancing the NPRS 
agenda. The incidence o f pove r ty in the K y r g y z Republic-based 
o n a consump t ion 
aggregate and de f ined by a na t iona l pove r ty line-fell 
f r om 63 percent in 2000 t o 43 

78 

percent in 2005, with extreme pove r ty f a l l i n g f r o m 24.7 percent t o 11 percent. Pove r ty 
has declined in b o t h ru ra l and u rban areas, and across a l l regions. Howeve r , pove r ty rates 
among oblasts as well as w i t h i n the oblast, i.e., urban and ru ra l sectors, are highly 
unequal. R u r a l pove r ty remains extremely high at 51 percent in 2005. 
6. 
The reduc t ion in income pove r ty was achieved due t o economic growth. The 
decline in extreme pove r ty has been no tab ly high during 2003-04, when the economy 
g rew by 7 percent. G r ow t h was driven m a i n l y by services, light industry and construction 
sectors, and re f lec ted the favorable nexus o f a stable macro-environment and increased 
demand f r o m fas t -g row ing ne ighbo r ing markets. Howeve r , this was n o t fully taken 
advantage o f due t o deteriorating p o l i t i c a l stability, increased rent seeking and stagnation 
o f re fo rms in some key sectors, especially energy. T h e high ag r icu l tu ra l g r ow t h rates o f 
the 1990s dec l ined t o just 2.5 percent since 2000. 
7. 
A l t h o u g h buoyant, economic g row th was vo la t i le and less that o f other C IS 
countries, Ave rage GDP g r ow t h was 4.1 percent pe r year during 2003-2006, but va r ied 
between 7 percent in 2003 and -0.2 percent in 2005 la rge ly re f lec t ing g o l d ou tpu t 
v o l a t i l i t y due t o a number o f natural disasters. N o n - g o l d GD P g rew o n average by about 
5.1 percent pe r year during the same period. T h i s g r ow t h was driven m a i n l y by services, 
light industry and construction sectors, and re f lec ted the favorable nexus o f a stable 
macro-environment and increased demand f r om fas t -g row ing ne ighbo r ing markets. 
Nevertheless, average g r ow t h over the pe r iod was considerably l e s s than in other C IS 
countries, ind ica t ing that the economy was n o t able t o take full advantage o f these 
cond i t ions due t o deteriorating p o l i t i c a l stability, increased ren t seeking and stagnation o f 
reforms in some k e y sectors, especially energy. A g r i c u l t u r a l p roduc t ion has also been 
vo la t i le and experienced a s ign i f ican t f a l l in 2005 (4.6 percent) p a r t l y in response t o the 
turbulent p o l i t i c a l situation o f that year. Trade disruptions caused by adverse p o l i t i c a l 
developments in the ne ighbo r ing Uzbekistan have also nega t ive ly affected ag r icu l tu ra l 
performance during the same period, 
8. 
The C A S pe r iod was characterized by b road macro-economic stability; the 4 
percent per annum target f o r in f la t ion was met. The country’s debt ou t look has also 
imp roved t o around 83 pe r cent o f GDP in 2005 f r om 11 1 percent o f GDP in 2002. T h i s 
was due t o a reduc t ion in the Government’s primary f isca l de f ic i t and s t ream l in ing o f 
ex te rna l ly financed p u b l i c investment projects. The debt position, however, remains 
difficult. D e s p i t e the s tab i l iza t ion o f debt ratios, they s t i l l rema in high and constitute a 
serious macroeconomic risk t o the Kyrgyz economy. 
9. 
Progress towards ach iev ing the NPRS human development goals was also m ixed . 
Desp i te under-funding o f the hea l th sector since 1996-2003, hea l th sector re fo rms led t o 
significant 
imp rovemen ts in performance and in the hea l th services people receive. 
These improvements are re f lec ted in imp roved equity o f access t o hea l th services, greater 
transparency, imp roved efficiency and qua l i ty o f service p rov is ion , reduc t ion in m o r t a l i t y 
from in fec t ious disease and imp roved adm in is t ra t ive e f f ic iency . Nevertheless, the 2005 
hea l th outcome indicators, such as in fan t (IMR), c h i l d (USMR) and maternal m o r t a l i t y 
(MMR) showed deterioration. This i s because these hea l th outcome indicators cannot b e 
imp roved by reforms in the hea l th sector alone. Increases o f IMR and U 5 M R since 2004 
can also be exp la ined by me thodo log ica l changes t o the ca lcu la t ion o f the m o r t a l i t y rates 
w i t h the m o v e t o in te rna t iona l ly comparable methods o f c a l p l a t i o n . Further, hea l th 

79 

statistics can o f ten take several years t o show improvements in response t o reforms; these 
results also almost certainly re f lec t the p rev ious years o f under-funding. F o r example, the 
MMR i s ve ry vo la t i le f r o m year t o year, reach ing 61 in 2005 and im p r o v i n g t o 44 in 
2006. The Government i s addressing th is under the second generation Manas T a a l im i

T h e Government's reco rd o n and comm i tmen t t o im p r o v i n g governance has been

conditions and a fragmentation o f state powe r during this pe r iod has meant that there has 
been l i t t l e observable imp rovemen t during the C A S pe r iod . Empowe rmen t o f l o c a l

Persistent co r rup t ion remains a daun t ing challenge. The K y r g y z Repub l ic was 
11. 
ranked 142 ou t o f 163 countries o n the 2006 Transparency In te rna t iona l Co r rup t ion 
Perceptions Index, a worsening f r om a ranking o f 130 ou t o f 159 countries f r om the 
previous year. The W o r l d BaWEBRD BEEPS showed co r rup t ion as a significant 
obstacle t o do ing business between 2002 and 2005. W h i l e this represents a s l i g h t 
imp rovemen t over p rev ious years, i t i s clear that addressing and reduc ing administrative 
co r rup t ion has been d i f f i c u l t . In 2004, the K y r g y z Repub l ic became a signatory t o the 
EITI. However, ove r ly ambitious commitments comb ined with a lack o f capacity have 
implied o n l y pa r t ia l compliance with the EITI.

Desp i te p o l i t i c a l uncertainties, the P r ime M in is te r and the President have p u b l i c l y 
stated that NPRS p r io r i t ies rema in v a l i d f o r the new Government, with a renewed focus 
o n addressing corruption, unemployment, and social inequa l i ty . Poo r governance, 
inc lud ing p u b l i c anger over the conduct o f pa r l iamen ta ry elections in ea r ly 2005, led t o 
the overthrow o f President Akaev in M a r c h 2005, and c i v i l unrest and disturbances in 
many areas o f the country. A l t h o u g h the subsequent Presidential elections in Ju ly 2005 
were deemed by OSCE t o b e free and fair, p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty has increased and made i t

11. CAS OUTCOMES 

A. CAS Objectives 

13. 
The C A S f o r 2003-06 focused on three key p r io r i t ies . Each i s aligned with the 
key long - te rm goals iden t i f ied in the Kyrgyz Republic’s NPRS and the C A S builds on the 
areas o f focus by further r e f i n i n g c r i t ica l r e f o rm p r io r i t ies within them. B a n k support f o r 
p r iva te sector l e d g r ow t h was c ruc ia l f o r helping sustain pove r ty reduc t ion and t o 
increase employment opportunities. A r res t ing the deterioration in p u b l i c services 
de l ive ry and in key infrastructure has a pos i t ive impac t on the non - income dimensions o f 
poverty, and Bank support in these areas builds on the success o f past interventions and 
impe ls progress towards ach iev ing the MDGs. Im p r o v i n g p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, 
the effectiveness o f p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion and o f p u b l i c service de l ive ry are a l l c r i t ica l 
factors fo r successful imp lemen ta t ion o f re fo rms in other areas. 
14. 
The highest p r i o r i t y was supporting p r iva te sector-led growth. Three k e y drivers 
o f economic g r ow t h - ag r icu l tu re and agro-processing, industry and energy, and sma l l 
and m i c r o enterprises - we re iden t i f ied IDA and I F C aimed t o h e l p the K y r g y z Repub l ic 
reduce bureaucratic barriers, m o v i n g t o ma rke t pricing, rehabilitate k e y infrastructure and 
increase access t o market i n f o rm a t i o n and financing. IDA and I F C w o u l d he lp strengthen 
ex is t ing f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions and create a f ramewo rk conducive t o a t t rac t ing investments,

IDA was t o

should he lp t o d ive rs i fy the economy, increase farm p roduc t iv i ty and g row th in non - fa rm 
jobs outside the m a i n cities. 
15. 
A second k e y p r i o r i t y was to help arrest the deterioration in k e y infrastructure and 
social services that had been s l ow l y worsening since independence. The K y r g y z 
Repub l ic c o u l d no t afford t o put o f f this rehabilitation; at the same time, i t cou ld n o t 
a f fo rd t o rehabilitate i t all, and requ i red t o b e selective and t o undertake systemic 
reforms. IDA sought t o support ove ra l l systemic changes t o make service p rov is ion mo re 
efficient, while empowe r ing loca l communities t o i d e n t i f y p r io r i t ies , in keep ing with the 
decentralized v is ion in the NPRS. 
16. 
A third p r i o r i t y was to address governance constraints t o g row th and pove r ty 
reduction, w h i l e recogn iz ing that th is was go ing t o b e a l o n g te rm challenge. In IDA’S 
c l ien t survey, poo r governance was iden t i f ied as among the mos t impo r tan t issues 
Increasing transparency and accountability, 
limiting returns t o structural reforms. 
building technical and imp lemen ta t ion capacity at the central and loca l levels, and 
supporting the continued development o f the NPRS and p u b l i c finance re fo rm as vehicles 
for government p lann ing and budge t ing were the k e y objectives. 

B. CAS Outcomes 

17. 
Progress towards ach iev ing C A S outcomes has been m ixed , and cou ld be 
considered mode ra te ly satisfactory during the C A S pe r iod . Considerable progress was 
made in ach iev ing the overarching C A S ob jec t ive o f pove r ty reduction. Several CAS - 
supported NPRS targets fo r social indicators have also imp roved (see Tab le 1). G r ow t h 
performance was volatile, in part due t o the p o l i t i c a l situation, but nevertheless the 
average annual GDP g r ow t h remains at about 4 percent. The Government’s comm i tmen t 
t o m o v i n g fo rwa rd with p o l i t i c a l re fo rms and im p r o v i n g governance, however, has been 
weak during the C A S pe r iod . 

1. Poverty Reduction 

18. 
Progress towa rd ach iev ing the pove r ty reduc t ion - an overarching outcome under 
the Government’s development strategy-has been generally satisfactory during the C A S 
period. Key pove r ty indicators showed a s ign i f ican t dec l in ing trend. Poverty-measured 
using consump t ion expend i tu res -dec l ined f r om an estimated 63 percent in 2000 t o 43 
percent in 2005. Ex t reme pove r ty has also fa l len and was 11 percent in 2005. The urban 
and ru ra l pove r ty b o t h f e l l s ign i f ican t ly during this pe r iod . 
19. 
Pove r ty rates among oblasts, as w e l l as within the oblast, Le., u rban and ru ra l 
sectors, are highly unequal. The u rban pove r ty rates f e l l faster, and were at a 
s ign i f ican t ly l ow e r leve l : 30 percent o f the u rban population, compared t o 5 1 percent o f 
the ru ra l popu la t ion , i s living be low the pove r ty l i n e in 2005. 
The authorities are closely m o n i t o r i n g pove r ty reduc t ion indicators, i n c l u d i n g 
non - income dimensions o f poverty. 
T h e N a t i o n a l Statistics Committee’s pove r ty 
statistics and measurement me thodo logy have imp roved considerably since 
the

in t roduc t ion o f the K y r g y z Integrated Househo ld Survey in 2003, supported by DfID. 
The Bank i s also p r o v i d i n g continuous me thodo log ica l technical assistance in pove r ty 
measurement through i t s Pove r ty Assessment. 
T h e l inkage between pove r ty m o n i t o r i n g and p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion remains weak. 
A l t h o u g h the authorities recognize 
that sustained pove r ty reduc t ion depends o n 
broadening sources o f economic g row th th rough continued r e f o rm and support t o p r iva te 
sector development, mo re needs t o b e done t o understand the g row th -pove r ty -

authorities a re w o r k i n g w i t h the W o r l d Bank o n the elaboration o f a pove r ty p r o f i l e data

2.1 M a c r o e c o n om i c E n v i r o nm e n t 

22. During the C A S period, a generally stable macroeconomic environment was 
achieved. Ove ra l l macroeconomic management during the C A S pe r iod has been in 
accordance with the IMF agreements under the Pove r ty Reduc t ion G r ow t h F a c i l i t y 
(PRGF) program. F isca l and external po l ic ies have kept in te rna l and external balances at 
sustainable leve ls . The f isca l de f ic i t was reduced f r om 4.7.percent o f GDP in 2003 t o 3.9 
percent in 2005, w h i l e the current account de f ic i t increased f r om 4.2 percent o f GDP in 
2003 t o 8.3 percent in 2005; the balance o f payments has been financed by s ign i f ican t 
i n f l ow s o n the capital account. T h e Government has also achieved good tax co l lec t ion 
performance. Tight f isca l and monetary po l ic ies have kept i n f l a t i o n at l o w rates o f 3-4 
percent throughout. 

23. 
T h e debt ou t look imp roved as a resu l t o f the reduc t ion in the general government 
p r im a r y f isca l deficit, the streamlining o f ex te rna l ly financed p u b l i c investment projects, 
and limiting p u b l i c debt t o loans. In M a r c h 2005, Paris C lub creditors granted a debt 
r e l i e f o n Evian terms for b i la te ra l p u b l i c debt. T h i s agreement i s expected t o result in a 
36 percent reduc t ion in the N P V o f o f f i c i a l b i la te ra l debt. T h e conversion t o 100 percent 
grant f o r F Y 0 6 has also contributed t o the imp rovemen t . Desp i te the improvement, the 
K y r g y z Republic’s debt-service capacity remains stressed over the medium term; the 
N P V o f p u b l i c debt cu r ren t ly stands at around 180 percent o f exports and over 360 
percent o f budget revenues, Le., above the H I P C threshold o f 150 percent and 250 
percent respectively. 

2.2 Business a n d F i n a n c i a l E n v i r o nm e n t 

24. 
T h e recen t ly completed Investment C l ima te Assessment ( ICA ) con f i rms that 
administrative barriers are an impo r tan t hindrance t o p r iva te sector g row th . Overall, 
businesses are constrained by unp red ic tab i l i ty and corruption, pa r t icu la r ly re la t ing t o 
regulations and lega l enforcement. M o r e specifically, 
the current l icens ing and 
inspec t ion regimes unde rm ine f i r m s ’ competitiveness and a b i l i t y t o grow. The Bank’s 
RTBET, approved by the Boa rd in Ju ly 2006, 
includes targeted support t o the 
Government’s deregulation efforts by s t ream l in ing and revamp ing the burdensome 
standards reg ime and p romo t ing enterprise competitiveness. In 2006, FIAS completed a 
review o n FDI L a w and conducted a wo rkshop f o r the Government and p r iva te sector t o 
discuss i t s results, however, the Government has n o t acted o n the repo r t and i t s 
recommendations. 

25. 
The tax system i s perceived as a ma jo r imped imen t : regulations a re numerous, 
inconsistent, and a re constantly being amended (over 300 times since 2000). In addition, 
inconsistencies present throughout the tax code create the opportunities f o r rent-seeking 
behavior no tab ly by tax inspectors, auditors, and tax po l ice . M a j o r revisions t o the T a x 
Code were proposed in 2006, i n c l u d i n g s imp l i f ica t ion th rough the reduc t ion o f nuisance 
taxes and k e y tax reductions in the context o f the agreed IMF PRGF program. However, 

85 

the con t inu ing deadlock between the Government and the Parliament has made the 
approval o f this and other leg is la t ion ve ry d i f f icu l t . 

26. 
There have been improvements in the f inanc ia l environment. T h e ove ra l l l e v e l o f 
p r iva te f inanc ing t o the economy has increased during the last three yea rs f r om 15.8 
percent o f GDP in 2003 t o a projected 17.2 percent o f GDP in 2005. Fo re ign direct 
investment has also increased, although f r om a very l o w base, but domestic savings have 
decreased slightly, f r om 18.5 percent o f GDP in 2003 t o 16.8 percent in 2005. B a n k loans 
and deposits increased as a percentage o f GDP f r om 3.5 percent and 5.7 percent in 2003 
t o 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent in 2005. Similarly, the credit p o r t f o l i o o f microfinance 
ins t i tu t ions has increased and n ow accounts fo r about 50 percent o f banks’ loans and 3 
percent o f GDP . The Payments and Banking System Mode rn iza t ion p ro jec t i s b e i n g 
satisfactorily implemented and i s expected t o lead t o improvements in the payments and 
clearance systems o f the bank ing sector.

The K A F C became a p r inc ipa l supplier o f credits in r u r a l areas with a 65 percent

The IDA - f i n a n c e d L a n d and Rea l Estate Reg is t ra t ion p ro jec t has been successful 
in increasing land tenure security, im p r o v i n g access t o investment capital, and mo re

2.3 Agriculture and Agro-Processing 

34. 
Ag r icu l tu ra l g r ow t h in the C A S pe r iod was modest, and severely affected by the 
p o l i t i c a l t u rm o i l o f 2005. The sector has considerable po ten t ia l but remains subject t o 
l o w p roduc t iv i ty and unpredictable fluctuations caused by c l ima t ic variations, natural 
disasters and also by exogenous factors such as p o l i t i c a l unrest and cross-border trade 
restrictions. The agro-input bus iness (except seeds) in pa r t icu la r remains weak because 
p r iva te entrepreneurs are unwilling t o comm i t s ign i f ican t resources. The risk that the 
Ministry o f Ag r icu l tu re m a y enter this market w i t h la rge government o r donor-funded 
inpu t d is t r ibu t ion programs at any momen t i s perceived as high. 
I F C identified agri-processing as an impo r tan t sector f o r development o f the 
K r y g y z economy. Support for this sector has been p rov ided th rough an investment in 
Akun, a lead ing enterprise that uses imp roved technology f o r the p roduc t ion o f f lou r and

pasta, m u c h o f w h i c h i s exported. Support f o r agri-processing i s also p rov ided th rough 
investment in packaging companies as w e l l as loans made th rough m ic ro f inance

IDA operations in this sector have been e x p l i c i t l y aimed at im p r o v i n g the 
operating environment f o r p r iva te farmers and agri-businesses and at re focus ing the 
p u b l i c sector o n p o l i c y and enabling functions in a ma rke t economy. The Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Support Services Project (ASSP) has been the central veh ic le fo r establishing e f fec t ive 
support services (extension, market in fo rma t ion , c rop protection, access t o seeds and 
credit) f o r farmers. T h e Second Ru ra l Finance project, n o w closed, l e d the w a y in

2.4 E n e r g y Sector 
40. 
At the beginning o f this C A S period, the quasi-fiscal de f ic i t in the energy sector 
had been reduced substantially ( f r om 17 t o 10.4 percent) due t o the Government’s efforts 
in energy sector r e f o rm in the p rev ious FY99 -01 C A S period, supported by the CSAC . I t 
was expected that re fo rms t o the energy sector t o further reduce losses and make i t 
f inanc ia l ly v iab le w o u l d continue during the current C A S period. Howeve r the 
Government fa i led t o increase e lec t r ic i ty t a r i f f s in l i n e with the M T T P approved in 2003, 
and targets fo r reduc ing comme rc ia l and technical losses were n o t met. P o l i t i c a l t u rm o i l 
and Parliamentary elections at the beg inn ing o f 2005 resulted in the Government 
de fe r r ing i t s planned tariff increases. Entrenched rent-seeking and vested interests within 
the energy sector have also adversely affected the Government’s commitments t o re fo rm . 
The absence o f p r iva t iza t ion o f energy and infrastructure projects as w e l l as a non- 
transparent lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk are obstacles t o increased fo re ign and I F 1 
investment in these sectors. 

41. 
Consequently, the Bank’s G S A C f a c i l i t y was closed be fo re the third and f i n a l 
tranche was released. T h e Imp lemen ta t ion Comp le t ion Report (ICR) determined that this 
project had been overambitious and cou ld n o t have been imp lemen ted in the t ime f rame 
envisaged. Several reasons contributed t o the unsatisfactory performance o f the G S AC 
project: an over-reliance on the poss ib i l i ty o f privatization, the adoption o f a rather 
rad ica l sector restructuring program, inadequate consideration o f coun t ry circumstances 
and sequencing, the u s e o f a Structural Ad jus tmen t L o a n (SAL ) rather than a Sector 
Adjustment Loan (SECAL ) , and investment lend ing fo r tack l ing wha t were operational 
problems in the sector, were a l l was p a r t l y t o blame. T h e Government intends t o m o v e 
fo rwa rd o n energy po l icy , i n c l u d i n g a concession o r p r iva t iza t ion o f the largest 
d is t r ibu t ion company, im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency and reduc ing co r rup t ion in the energy 
sector and t a r i f f p o l i c y . During 2006, the first steps towards a renewed comm i tmen t to 
energy re fo rms were taken w i t h the un i f ica t ion o f household t a r i f f s in M a y 2006.

42. 
The mining sector accounts f o r over 10 percent o f GDP . The NPRS recognized 
that i t s development and po ten t ia l was hampered by a p o o r lega l and regu la to ry 
f ramewo rk as well as a lack o f transparency. IDA supported an ongo ing mining dialogue 
and technical assistance th rough an IDF grant t o support the authorities in deve lop ing the 
appropriate lega l and ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk f o r the development o f the sector. 
A l though a number o f proposals f o r lega l re fo rms have been developed, entrenched 
interests have prevented mos t o f these f r om be ing implemented. T h e delays in 
imp lemen ta t ion continued even after the change o f Government in M a r c h 2005, amid 
concerns that reforms in the sector consistent with international no rms might imply a loss 
o f sovereignty t o the K y r g y z Repub l ic . Nevertheless one impo r tan t advance was the 
endorsement by the Government o f the E IT I in M a y 2004. Howeve r compliance with 
commitments has been l im i t e d due in part t o weak capacity; the Government produced 

89 

some compliance reports in 2004, but there have been none after that. The absence o f 
transparency in the award and mon i to r ing o f mining concessions hampers the attraction 
o f new investment, and pa r t icu la r ly fo re ign investment i n t o the sector.

Roads account f o r around 92 percent o f f r e i g h t movements and 99 percent o f

with separate b ranch l i n e s that link the no r th o f the coun t ry t o the Kazakhstan r a i l system,

T h e Government received substantial f inanc ia l assistance f r om external donors 
for road improvement, pa r t icu la r ly f r om the ADB. Howeve r , m u c h o f this investment 
was targeted at the rehab i l i ta t ion o f the ma jo r trade corridors, with m u c h l e s s resources

in s ign i f ican t increases in veh ic le operating costs and t rave l time. 
Inadequate

The Urban Transport p ro jec t closed in Novembe r 2005, and the rehab i l i ta t ion o f 
the B ishkek -Osh r o a d funded by several IFIs i s almost complete. Howeve r , several 
p o l i c y issues in the sector have yet t o be resolved. W i t h o u t a proper road maintenance

The Bank ’s support t o central government in the areas o f health, education and

D e s p i t e the enactment o f a new c i v i l service l a w and laws requiring asset and

the Chamber o f Accounts, the ove ra l l pace o f c i v i l service re fo rm has been slow. The 
C i v i l Service Law , approved in June 2004, was amended by the Jogorku Kenesh t o 
increase the powers o f ministers in appointments and reduce the ro le o f the C i v i l Service 
Agency (CSA), thus ra is ing questions about the Government’s comm i tmen t to c i v i l

o f a close re la t ive o f the President as State Secretary o f the CSA . 
f o l l ow i n g the M a r c h revolution, there was considerable pressure t o make high l e v e l

i s s t i l l uneven across government structures. T h e proportions o f appointments th rough 
due process are n o w close t o 90 percent, compared with about 30 percent in the months 
after the revo lu t ion . There i s a greater recogn i t ion within the Government o f the 
importance o f a m e r i t based c i v i l service. Progress made at the end o f 2006 has been 
su f f ic ien t t o upgrade the imp lemen ta t ion o f the G S AC t o moderately satisfactory and 
authorize the disbursement o f the delayed second tranche. The establishment o f the C S A 
and compe t i t ive appointment procedures can be the basis fo r further reforms, i f the 
necessary consensus and understanding can be developed at the highest p o l i t i c a l leve ls . 
65. 
The imp lemen ta t ion o f the L a w o n Dec la ra t ion o f Income and Assets by high 
state o f f ic ia ls (approved in June 2004) was also s low and, until early 2006, compliance 
was low , pa r t icu la r ly among parliamentarians. There was a reluctance t o publish the

M u c h progress has been made in the p rov is ion o f essential services f o r the ru ra l 
population. Examples inc lude : adv iso ry services fo r farmers th rough the W B / I F A D / S D C 
funded ASSP; infrastructure services such as drinking water, e lec t r ic i ty and road access 
th rough the V IP ; p r ima ry hea l th infrastructure maintenance and school repairs th rough

Under the OIP, WUA’s creation, registration, and strengthening continue. At the 
end o f 2006, 436 W A S have been lega l ly registered, se rv ing 710,000 h a ou t o f the 
developed area o f 1.1 m i l l i o n ha. O rgan iz ing large groups o f water users and achieving 
their acceptance and openness towards such aspects as cost recove ry for operation and 
maintenance, are t ime -consum ing and complex. The WUA concept has n o w been fully 
accepted in the coun t ry and the founda t ion i s l a i d f o r sustainable WUA development in 
the future. 

72. 
F r om data collected f r o m ten schemes where rehab i l i ta t ion wo rks were completed 
at least tw o years ago, i t i s evident that there are already pos i t ive impacts. The analysis 
showed that the water supply reduced in e i g h t o f these schemes, w h i c h means that the 
rehabilitated systems are operated mo re e f f ic ien t ly . In seven schemes, the crop y ie lds 

95 

and gross p roduc t ion have already increased substantially. N i n e o f the W A S have 
increased i r r i g a t i o n service fees; operation and maintenance expenditures increased and 
co l lec t ion rates are high, with eight W A S co l lec t ing mo re than 90 percent o f the fees. 

73 . 

In addition, the Ru ra l Water Supply and Sanitation p ro jec t has already p rov ided 
imp roved water supply systems f o r about 120 villages, cove r ing about 20 percent o f the 
to ta l popu la t ion o r about one third o f the r u r a l population. T h e result w i l l be t o imp rove 
access t o po tab le water in the m a j o r i t y o f the v i l lages in the Issyk -Ku l , N a r y n and Talas 
Oblasts as we l l as hygiene and sanitation in these areas. The commun i ty based approach 
t o ’management o f ru ra l water supply systems i n c l u d i n g the selection, implementation, 
operation and maintenance o f water supply systems has been internalized, and there i s 
evidence o f the communities’ commitment t o the process. 

74. 

The Bank ’s VIP has had a ma jo r impac t o n governance at the l o c a l level, r a p i d l y 
spreading and ins t i tu t iona l iz ing concepts and practices such as transparency, c i t izen 
involvement, and p u b l i c accountability. C omm u n i t y con t r ibu t ions are m u c h h ighe r than 
anticipated and m ic ro -p ro jec ts have been imp lemen ted qu ick ly , e f f ic ien t ly and at high 
qua l i ty . Project coverage o f ru ra l communities i s already mo re than doub le that expected 
at appraisal, and in -coun t ry pressure t o expand coverage even m o r e r a p i d l y i s high. 

IILMEASURING BANK PERFORMANCE 

7 5 . When the C A S was approved, the weaknesses in p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty and the risk o f 
economic shocks were considered. However, the strategy did n o t and cou ld no t have 
envisaged the degree o f p o l i t i c a l and economic d is loca t ion that took place in M a r c h 2005 
and that subsequently affected over a third o f the C A S pe r iod . Despite these adverse 
circumstances the performance o f the Bank cou ld b e considered satisfactory. The Bank 
p rog ram focused o n visible r e s u l t s and achieved considerable success pa r t icu la r ly in 
ru ra l - and commun i ty based projects. The qua l i ty o f the Bank’s products and services 
was n o t compromised, and the p o r t f o l i o imp lemen ta t ion remained generally o n track. 
Aid coo rd ina t ion imp roved s ign i f ican t ly and resulted in the preparation o f j o i n t projects 
and technical assistance, as we l l as a Joint Coun t ry Support Strategy. 

76 . 

Ove ra l l the sustainability o f the Bank’s strategy and i t s imp lemen ta t ion i s l i k e l y . 
Where pos i t ive outcomes have been achieved; they are l i k e l y t o b e sustained. The 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank p rog ram has been successful in several areas o f ins t i tu t iona l 
r e f o rm w h i c h have been ma in ta ined through s ign i f ican t stress-testing. One example i s 
the deepening o f land reform. The Bank supported Cadastre system was tested during the 
revo lu t ion . Under pressure the system processed thousands o f inqu i r ies and ma in ta ined 
i t s in teg r i ty . Ano the r example i t the ove ra l l transparency o f the hea l th expenditures 
w h i c h continue t o b e sustained; and hea l th care re fo rms w h i c h have l e d t o a mo re robust

T h e ove ra l l development effectiveness o f the Bank’s assistance p rog ram and i t s

during the C A S pe r iod has shown good qua l i ty at entry, and generally satisfactory

one third achieved their ins t i tu t iona l development impact. The mos t recent OPCS repo r t

The Bank G roup also delivered a number o f impo r tan t ESW reports over the C A S 
period, i n c l u d i n g the f o l l ow i n g : Pove r ty Assessment; Pub l ic Expenditure Review; 
Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment; Coun t ry Procurement Assessment; Trade

Transport Fac i l i ta t ion Report, and the Central A s i a MDG study ( inc lud ing K y r g y z case 
studies in hea l th and education).

The Qua l i ty Assurance G roup (QAG ) rated the K y r g y z Repub l ic ’s ESW p rog ram 
as “Satisfactory” overall, as w e l l as in i t s dimensions o f In te rna l Quality, Participation, 
Consultation and Dissemination, and L i k e l y Impac t . T h e dimensions o f Strategic 
Relevance as w e l l as Coherence and In teg ra t ion were rated as “Highly Satisfactory”. 
Bank Inputs and Processes were also rated Satisfactory. The p rog ram i s rema rkab ly 
homogenous, w i th o n l y t w o o f the 12 tasks in the sample rated less than satisfactory. 

81. 
Several AAA tasks were highly instrumental in h e l p i n g other donors shape the i r 
respective programs in the K y r g y z Republic. F o r example, the PER helped DfID, EU 
and USAID support imp roved budget management, i n c l u d i n g the in t roduc t ion o f the 
MTBF; the FSAP helped unde rp in the Fund’s PRGF, and secure donors’ support f o r

T h e Assessment Panel suggested that the fu tu re AAA p rog ram cou ld consider

B. Po r t fo l io Assessment 

84. 
T h e size o f the Bank’s p o r t f o l i o was re la t ive ly s tab le throughout the C A S period. 
The number o f projects grew t o 19 in 2006 from 16 in 2003, w h i l e to ta l commitments 
slightly decreased f r om almost US$286 m i l l i o n in F Y 0 3 t o US$268 million in November 
2006. T h i s decrease was due to the closure o f f i v e projects worth during FY05 -06 , with 
four new operations being approved in the s am e pe r iod . M o r e than 50 percent o f current 
operations and more than 60 percent o f to ta l comm i tmen ts was inhe r i ted f r om the 
p rev ious C A S period. 

85. 
Recent p ro jec t approvals are closely aligned with the FY 0 3 - 0 6 C A S and, with the 
exception o f two projects, are on schedule. An energy project, o r i g i n a l l y planned f o r 
FY06 , and a PRSG that has slipped two years f r o m F Y 0 5 t o FY07-may n o t be inc luded 
in the JCSS. There have been some slippages31 and deviations3* f r om the program, but 
ove ra l l most programmed activities were imp lemen ted as planned33. The Business 
Enhancement component o f the F inanc ia l Sector and Business Deve lopmen t Project had 
to b e cut f r o m the o r ig ina l p ro jec t and i t s preparation postponed to FY 0 6 . S im i la r ly , the 
Agriculture Mode rn iza t ion and Marketing Project had t o b e split i n t o tw o projects, with 
the Agribusiness and Marketing Project hav ing become e f f e c t i v e in M a y 2005. The 
Water Management Imp rovemen t Project was de l ive red in FY 0 6 . E SW and TA ac t iv i t ies 
were c lose ly aligned with the CAS . 

86. 
Disbursements have improved substantially compared t o the p rev ious C A S 
period. Th roughou t FY03-05, the disbursement ra t io was consistently higher than the 
E C A average, increasing f rom around 2 0 percent in F Y 0 3 t o almost 29 percent in 
FY0534 . The average p ro jec t age o f 3.935 years i s a l i t t l e h ighe r than the E C A average o f 
3.4 years, which can p a r t l y be attributed t o some projects being extended. 

87. 
In FY03 , several projects had s low disbursement (ma in ly due t o ceilings imposed 
on the Pub l ic Investment Program (PIP), procurement problems, and p ro jec t management 
flags. Throughout FY04 , efforts were made t o imp rove p o r t f o l i o performance and the 
number o f flags has been s ign i f ican t ly reduced. The nature o f flags also changed, from 
“process” flag categorization in 2003 t o m o s t l y s low d i s b u r ~ e m e n t ~ ~ and lega l covenant 
problems in 2004/5. The ove ra l l status o f the coun t ry p o r t f o l i o was also a f fec ted by a 
coun t ry reco rd flag, due t o n e t disconnect exceeding the 2 0 percent threshold. 

3 1 

E.g. Livestock Review planned for FY05, slipped to FY06; the Integrated Financial Assessment 
(IFA) planned for FY04, slipped to FY06; the Investment Climate Assessment<ICA) slipped from FY05 to 
FY04. 

Currently ongoing Energy DialogueITA, was not envisioned in the FY03-FY06 CAS. 
CEh4fDPR was dropped in FY05, GFATM Implementation TA - in FY04. A lso , Environmental 
Expenditure and Policy planned for FY06, seems to have been dropped. 
Average disbursement ra t io in ECA was 19.7 in 2003, 18.3 in 2004, and 23.8 in 2005. 
As o f November 6,2005 
The slow disbursement flag may be indicative o f capacity and commitment problems.

T h e CPPRs have evo lved i n t o an e f fec t ive t o o l f o r manag ing p o r t f o l i o 
performance. M o s t process-related issues identified as generic, i.e., compliance with 
procurement, disbursement and financial management requirements, during earlier 
CPPRs have been resolved. T h e most recent CPPRs put a greater emphasis o n result- 
based approaches in p o r t f o l i o management and launched the discussion with the 
Government o n h o w the p o r t f o l i o contributes t o ach iev ing C A S goals. 
In addition, 
CPPRs focused attention o n mo re specific issues, such as taxa t ion o f p ro jec t resources, 
p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion unit (PIU) inspections, and insu f f ic ien t coo rd ina t ion o f donors 
and p o r t f o l i o by the Government. Moreover, CPPRs contribute s ign i f ican t ly t o donor 
coo rd ina t ion as they are conducted j o i n t l y with other development partners, such as 
ADB, I s D B and KfW. 
90 . During the current C A S period, I F C has financed 6 projects f o r the to ta l amount 
o f U S $10 m i l l i o n . F i v e projects were in the f inanc ia l sector and one p ro jec t in the pulp 
and paper sector. Add i t iona l ly , I F C has invested in reg iona l projects that bene f i t the 
K y r g y z Republic. These inc lude the Central A s i a M i c r o and Sma l l Enterprises F a c i l i t y

C. Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination 

92. 
D ia logue w i th the Government has been constructive throughout the C A S pe r iod 
and, even during the run-up t o elections and after the appointment o f the new 
administration, the Government has continued t o consult w i t h the B a n k o n macro- 
economic and social p o l i c y issues. E f fo r ts t o engage in dialogue with Parliament o n core 
p o l i c y w o r k has required add i t iona l t im e and e f fo r t by the Bank team, but this has been 
c r i t ica l in ensuring a better understanding o f the need for re fo rms in areas such as the 
energy sector. The C G meetings in 2002 and 2004 were ex t reme ly bene f ic ia l f o r 
c l a r i f y i n g the Bank’s and other donors’ support 
f o r the Government’s ove ra l l 
development agenda. 

93. 
Regular meetings have been h e l d with N G O and c i v i l society group 
representatives o n a range o f topics. F o r example, in 2004, the P rog ramma t ic Pove r ty 
Ana lys is team he ld dissemination meetings at sub-national leve l with academicians, 
NGO s and loca l administrators t o share the findings o f their wo rk . Howeve r , these 
efforts have n o t dispelled skepticism and distrust o f international f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions 
and donors in general, w h i c h has worsened in recent months. The u p c om i n g JCSS 2007- 
10 o f a core group o f f i v e partners, inc ludes plans fo r a sustained outreach p rog ram that 
w i l l he lp better relations with c i v i l society and hope fu l ly reduce distrust and suspicion o f 
the donor commun i ty .

94. 
D o n o r coo rd ina t ion and ha rmon iza t ion in the K y r g y z Repub l ic i s w e l l advanced, 
b o t h in p rac t ica l terms and in spirit. T h e effectiveness o f the D o n o r Counc i l was 
demonstrated in the immed ia te pos t -Revo lu t ion weeks in M a r c h 2005 when members 
were able t o speak with one voice. Since then, several j o i n t letters have been sent t o the 
Government ra is ing dono r concerns, and a coordinator has been funded by donors. There 
has been rea l progress in p ro jec t co-financing, j o i n t donor missions, j o i n t p o l i c y positions 
and j o i n t IF1 p o r t f o l i o reviews. T h e recen t ly approved Hea l th SWAP i s a good example 
o f a ha rmon iz ing p rog ram i n v o l v i n g f i v e partners. 

95. 
Since the October 2002 C G mee t ing in B ishkek , a i d coo rd ina t ion and 
ha rmon iza t ion have been high o n the agenda. 
In December 2003, the Government 
in i t ia ted the establishment o f a ha rmon iza t ion steering comm i t tee and w o r k i n g group, 
comp r is ing government and donor representatives. T h e w o r k i n g group developed a draft 
ha rmon iza t ion and a l ignmen t p rog ram and ac t ion plan. A j o i n t C A S i s one o f the 
objectives o f the ac t ion plan. At the H i g h - L e v e l F o r um o n Ha rmon iza t ion in Rome in 
February 2003, the K y r g y z Repub l ic was iden t i f ied as a p i l o t coun t ry o n ha rmon iza t ion 
and has been ac t ive ly pa r t ic ipa t ing in the O rgan iza t ion f o r Econom ic Cooperation and 
Development Assistance Comm i t tee (OECD -DAC ) meetings. 

96 . 
In fo rma t ion sharing and coo rd ina t ion have imp roved over the last three years, and 
the donor commun i ty has made s ign i f ican t steps towards the ha rmon iza t ion o f 
procedures. Examples inc lude : the u s e o f the W o r l d Bank’; Pove r ty Assessment Report 
by the ADB f o r i t s CAS , close coo rd ina t ion o f the IMF’s structural re fo rm agenda with 
W o r l d Bank and ADB policies, a j o i n t Po r t fo l io Rev iew by the ADB, W o r l d Bank, KfW 
and the IsDB in 2004, and the decision by KfW t o fund a ru ra l commun i ty infrastructure 
project based o n the appraisal and imp lemen ta t ion documents o f the Bank ’s V IP . 

97 . 
The O ECD /D AC Survey o n Ha rmon iza t ion and A l ignmen t has indicated a 
number o f areas that need further improvements. The survey po in ts t o a ve ry weak use o f 
coun t ry systems by donors. A lso , there i s n o rea l alignment with sector programs, with 
the exception o f the hea l th sector. Dono rs did n o t streamline their cond i t iona l i ty and 
o n l y about 10 percent o f the approximately 250 f i e l d missions were carried ou t j o i n t l y . 
The survey report also notes that w h i l e there i s a h igh - leve l o f comm i tmen t by the 
Government t o a id effectiveness, the capacity t o d r i v e the process remains weak. These 
factors should be addressed in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the upcom ing JCSS. 

D. Lessons and Recommendations 

98. 
G i v e n the fi-actured po l i t ics and weak coun t ry ownership, building consensus fo r 
reforms w i l l requ i re con t inued p o l i c y and b road consultation, i n c l u d i n g with Parliament. 
Resurgent na t iona l ism and the mo re in te rven t ion is t economic approach o f the new 
Government m a y requ i re a m o r e f lex ib le economic dialogue. T h e challenge f o r the Bank 
and other donors i s t o find e f fec t ive ways t o support the Government in a time o f p o l i t i c a l 
upheaval and uncertainty. Skepticism towards the Government and development partners 
highlights the importance o f engaging with and supporting non-government stakeholders. 

101 

T h e key w i l l be t o in i t ia te sustainable processes that w i l l catalyze broader reforms, and 
build champions f o r them among the pub l ic . 

99 . 

Po l ic ies that have a visible impac t as perceived by beneficiaries are mo re l i k e l y t o 
generate b road p u b l i c support fo r reforms. Given current capacity and ins t i tu t iona l 
constraints, proposed re fo rms w i l l have t o be modest and sequential, focus ing o n step-by- 
step imp rovemen t over a l o n g pe r iod o f t ime with a focus o n tangible results. 

100. P o l i c y re fo rms requ i r ing ins t i tu t iona l changes o f ten take m u c h longer than 
expected. 
There are many reasons f o r this, i n c l u d i n g l im i ta t ions o f the host’s 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity and the Bank ’s o w n supervision capacity, the absence o f 
prerequisites f o r durable reform, and the t ime l a g between altered incentives and resu l tan t 
changes in behavior. There are an i n f i n i t e numbe r o f exogenous factors that can delay 
implementation. Expectations, and related performance indicators, o n the pace o f r e f o rm 
and response t o re fo rm should re f lec t that experience. 

101. Cond i t iona l i ty remains impo r tan t but has p roven t o b e a blunt instrument in 
persuading the Government t o carry ou t ma jo r ins t i tu t iona l (and pa r t icu la r ly governance) 
reforms. T h e use o f structural adjustment credits have n o t wo rked we l l in the context o f 
the K y r g y z Republic. The adoption o f a m o r e consultative process t o cond i t iona l i ty , 
around mu l t i -dono r f inanc ia l support, m a y be appropriate. 

102. Some projects-in energy, the G S AC and G T AC , f o r i n s t a n c e h a v e been ove r ly 
complex in their objectives. With imp lemen ta t ion capacity such a ma jo r constraint, the 
Bank and other donors must make every e f fo r t t o make projects as s imp le as possible and 
be patient when things d o n o t move as expected. 

103. Desp i te the less than idea l environment 
f o r budget support, the pos i t ive 
experience with the hea l thy SWAP suggests that p rog ramma t ic approaches, pa r t icu la r ly

104. T h e JCSS should consider a l e s s ambitious r e f o rm agenda and focus (in the short 
te rm ) o n ensuring that re fo rms achieved in areas such as hea l th and education t o date are 
protected. P u b l i c f inanc ia l management reforms, f o r example, have been instrumental in 
ensuring macro-economic s tab i l i ty and g r ow t h during the C A S pe r iod . In some cases, 
the results o f projects under the p rev ious C A S are o n l y j u s t starting t o show now . T h f s 
should be taken i n t o consideration when de te rm in ing the m i x o f instruments and sector 
activities f o r the JCSS, and in choosing ind ica to rs f o r measuring success o f the Bank’s 
program. 

105. Greater se lec t iv i ty w i l l be needed in the nex t CAS/JCSS pe r iod . The need f o r 
p r io r i t iza t ion i s evident g iven the l im i t e d IDA resources and the l im i ta t ions p laced o n the 
Government’s o w n Pub l ic Investment Plan. In this regard, donors w i l l need t o assist the

I F C projects in the f inanc ia l sector, mining, agribusiness and manu fac tu r ing have 
been successful, however, a l l have faced d i f f icu l t ies as a result o f issues related t o the 
business environment and .the absence o f reg iona l cooperation w h i c h limits ma rke t 
opportunities f o r and thus the economic v i a b i l i t y o f K y r g y z enterprises. Projects 
generally requ i re s ign i f ican t levels o f technical assistance t o ensure the economic 
v i a b i l i t y and long - te rm sustainability o f I F C investments.
