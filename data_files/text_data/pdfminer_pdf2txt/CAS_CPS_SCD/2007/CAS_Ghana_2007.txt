EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The World Bank w i l l support Ghana’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) for the 
country to achieve middle-income status and the Millennium Development Goals, and to ensure 
that benefits of growth a re shared. Ove ra rch ing ob jec t ives are t o suppor t Ghana to : (i) sustain 
econom ic g r o w t h o f a t least 6% p e r year; (ii) surpass the 2 0 15 M i l l e n n i u m D e v e l o pm e n t G o a l o f h a l v i n g 
p o v e r t y t o 26% a lready during this C A S per iod ; and (iii) start t o reduce inequa l i t ies . 

The World Bank Group Program i s anchored in the Consultative Group (CG) annual framework 
of Results, Resources and Partnership, as agreed between the Government of Ghana and its 
Development Partners. Based o n the GPRS 11, the o v e r a l l Ghana Par tnersh ip Resu l ts M a t r i x i s the 
p r i o r i t i z e d f r am ew o r k also f o r the CAS , i n d i c a t i n g ob jec t ives , baselines, targets, gove rnmen t ac t ion and

A id E f fec t iveness and H a rm o n i z a t i o n A c t i o n P l a n lays o u t comm i tmen ts f o r the e v o l v i n g par tnersh ip . 

To further harmonize partners’ contributions, the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (GJAS) was 
signed by 16 partners, representing 95% of aid disbursements, on February 27,2007. This CAS , 
consists o f Pa r t I, the G-JAS , l a y i n g o u t comm i tmen ts by partners, a n d Pa r t 11, a W o r l d B a n k G r o u p 
P r o g r am with Ghana. T h e two pa r ts are comp lemen tary and n e e d t o b e r e a d together. 

Under the previous CAS, Ghana exceeded the tw o over-arching objectives of increasing growth and 
reducing poverty. The g r ow t h targe t was set at 5%, above the two p reced ing decades. In 2004-6, 
average g r ow t h was 6%. T h e p o v e r t y target was set at 32% f o r 2007, compa red t o 39.5% in 1999. The

de l ivered , p o r t f o l i o q u a l i t y im p r o v e d and disbursements accelerated. M a j o r lessons inc lude : governmen t

engagement requ ires fu r the r e f fo r t ; and decen tra l iza t ion o f B a n k capac i ty i s c r i t i c a l t o c l i e n t needs. 

The foundations for Ghana’s development are strong, but to break out of its low-income status and 
meet its middle-income aspirations, Ghana needs a shift in governance performance. I t needs t o 
e v o l v e the p o l i t i c a l economy a round p r o - g r ow t h p o l i c i e s and i t s capac i ty f o r va lue - fo r -money choices in 
the p u b l i c sector, a lso em p ow e r i n g d i s t r i c t and m u n i c i p a l governmen t . T h e C A S seeks t o strengthen 
o v e r a l l deve lopmen t dialogue, based o n ev idence- and results-based p u b l i c p o l i c y cho ice and an annua l 
Consu l ta t ive G r o u p (CG) f ramewo rk ; the r o l e o f the budget, i t s f i d u c i a r y underp inn ings , and i t s

Growth in Ghana has strongly contributed to poverty reduction, but consumption, spatial and 
gender inequalities are emerging as significant challenges. T h e Ghana Living S tandard Survey 
(GLSS) shows tha t econom ic g r o w t h i s the m a j o r fac to r b e h i n d Ghana’s r a p i d r e d u c t i o n in pove r ty . 
G r o w t h can b e sustained and accelerated in Ghana, and can there fore d r i v e p o v e r t y leve ls d o w n fur ther . 
Howeve r , inequa l i t ies , o l d a n d emerging, requ i re strategic a t ten t ion . Some r u r a l areas, n o t a b l y in the 
no r th , but also elsewhere, see l o w e r g r ow t h rates, less e f fec t ive service p rov is ion , and s lowe r p o v e r t y 
reduc t ion . T h o u g h n o t as poor , Ghana’s u r b a n areas see n e w inequa l i t ies emerge. Ghana i s m a k i n g o n l y 

l im i t e d progress o n gender equa l i ty , despite focus o n i t s impo r tance . I f n o t addressed, Ghana’s 
m o d e r n i z a t i o n w i l l b e accompan ied by greater i n t e r n a l inequa l i t ies . Broad-based j o b s c rea t ion in a 
g r ow i n g e c o n om y w i l l b e the strongest fac to r t o reduce p o v e r t y and diminish inequa l i t ies . 

Analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) i s set to play a larger ro l e . As the coun t ry evo lves o u t o f a 

l ow - i n c om e parad igm , the B a n k ’ s r o l e in p r o v i d i n g AAA services needs strengthening. T h e G L S S w i l l 
p r o v i d e a n e w s ta t is t ica l resource. A g r ow t h d ia logue was i n i t i a t e d by the Pres iden t o f Ghana, John A.

I F C and M I G A have stepped up their engagement, allowing an integrated World Bank Group 

approach to emerge. Ghana’s c omm i tm e n t t o p r i v a t e sec tor- led deve lopmen t i s crea t ing fa r la rge r space 
f o r the G roup ’s ins trumen ts . B o t h the I F C a n d MIGA p o r t f o l i o s have grown cons iderab ly . I F C has

Regional integration i s critical to Ghana. As cu r ren t c h a i r o f the A f r i c a n U n i o n (AU), Ghana i s

Results: The World Bank Program Results Matrix takes into account government’s indication o f

1. Introduction 

February 2007 

1.1 Rationale for the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy 

The Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) aims to improve the alignment of 
development assistance with the core business of Government and the 
Government‘s political and partnership cycle. It builds on commitments by 
development partners (DPs) to work toward the achievement of goals and priorities 
of the second Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) and to 
accelerate progress against mutually defined harmonization principles. 

An important backdrop for the G-JAS is the Ghana Partnership Strategy (GPS) 
endorsed at the November 2005 Consultative Group/Annual Partnership Meeting 
(CG/APM) and updated for the CG/APM in June 2006. The GPS comprises a results 
matrix which maps DP-funded activities to GPRS II policy priorities; an annual 
harmonisation action plan; and an overview of external assistance, detailed by GPRS 
II pillar and sectors. As such, the GPS provides a framework for monitoring the 
effectiveness of development assistance in supporting GPRS II. 

The G-JAS involves the majority of Ghana’s GPS development partners (represent- 
ing about 95% of official development assistance flows), who wish to take the DP 
response in support of the GPRS II one step further. I t consists of five interlinking 
elements that contribute to a comprehensive approach on the part of DPs to the aid 
relationship in Ghana: 

(i) 
a joint assessment of the current country situation (political, economic, social); 
(ii) a joint description o f the major challenges facing Ghana in its quest to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and middle-income status; 
(iii) a statement of principles and commitments on how G-JAS partners will work 
with each other, with Government, and with civil society and private 
stake ho Ide rs; 
(iv) priorities for the joint DP response at the GPRS II pillar and sector level; and 
(v) arrangements for results monitoring and risk mitigation. 

The G-JAS should be seen as a milestone in an on-going process, which provides a 
framework for continued action over the next four years. Concrete actions for moving 
forward are therefore presented as part of the G-JAS conclusions. 

The timeframe for the G-JAS is the four year period starting in 2007 and ending in 
2010. This timeframe has been adopted to take into account national cycles in 
Ghana: new governments are elected in December every four years (2004 ,2008 , 
2012) and the next GPRS time-slice is prepared during the government’s first year in 
office (2005, 2009, 2013) for implementation during the next four year cycle (2006- 
2009, 2010-2013, etc.). The first year of GPRS implementation (2006, 2010, 2014) is 
therefore the time when G-JAS partners can consult with government and 
stakeholders to review new GPRS priorities and make any needed alignment and 
programming adjustments, which would then be reflected in the subsequent G-JAS 
framework (2007-2010, 201 1-2014, etc.). 

The linkages between the national level development framework (GPRS II and the 
Africa Peer Review Mechanism, APRM), the GPS, and the G-JAS are presented in 
Figure 1 :

G-JAS 

February 2007 

Figure 1 : The National Strategy Context and the G J A S 

Following adoption of the G-JAS, partner-by-partner decision making on aid alloca- 
tions will be replaced by better cooperation and joint programming, anchored in the 
national development strategy. More concretely, we expect to see by the end of the 
G-JAS period: 

higher quality dialogue between DPs and the government, 
improved aid delivery through a better division of labour and a solid process for 
deciding who does what, 
greater harmonisation in the way development assistance is delivered, 
increased reliance on programme based modalities and coordinated technical 
assistance programmes that support government priorities, 
improved predictability in resource flows and reduced transactions costs for 
government, and 
better alignment of DP country strategies and resource allocations with GPRS II 
goals and priorities. 

. . . . 
. . 

The G-JAS reflects strong Development Partner political will to engage in a more 
harmonised and efficient dialogue with the government in all aspects of development 
cooperation. However, we note that the G-JAS is not legally binding. To the extent 
that the G-JAS is inconsistent with the laws or policies of any signatory, such laws, 
policies, and commitments will prevail.

1.2 Partners in the G-JAS Process 

The role of Government in the G J A S process 

The government has developed the GPRS I I (2006-2009) and has welcomed the DP 
initiative to better define how the development community will support GPRS II 
implementation. By seeking to reduce fragmentation, improve harmonised working, 
and enhance alignment, the G-JAS seeks to support government leadership of its 
national development strategy. DPs consulted the government at key milestones in 
the development of the G-JAS, and sought its feedback in the formulation of the final 
document. 

Overall, the government finds the G-JAS to be a good start at developing a 
harmonised approach to multi-annual programming. However, DPs were encouraged 
to be more ambitious in setting performance targets and accelerating introduction of 
harmonized modalities. As the government would like to avoid increased transaction 
costs when engaging with DPs, it has requested that harmonized approaches and 
procedures be as streamlined as possible. The government also encouraged DPs to 
keep in mind its desire to see budget support increase as a share of official 
development assistance, within a scaled-up financial envelope for the country. DPs 
have taken these comments on board, and will seek to apply their spirit in the 
implementation of the G-JAS. 

Regarding the future, the government accepts the need to be more involved in 
directing the G-JAS process from this point forward, and welcomes further discussion 
about how the government and DPs can improve our joint partnership, with the 
objective of improving aid effectiveness and achieving development results. To 
facilitate the partnership, government intends to define a clear aid and external 
resource mobilisation strategy that can provide guidance for DPs. 

The role of Civil Society Organisations in the G J A S process 

In its preparatory stages, civil society organisations (CSOs) were encouraged to give 
their views on the G-JAS process and to share information about the strategic 
priorities for the joint assistance programme. Following completion of the document, 
it is expected that CSOs (NGOs, APRM Secretariat, Private Sector associations, as 
well as independent research institutions) will be involved in monitoring 
implementation of the aid partnership framework as provided for in the Paris 
Declaration and the Ghana Harmonisation and Aid Effectiveness Action Plan (G- 
HAP). Moreover, G-JAS DPs will seek to include Parliament as well as CSOs in a 
more structured and transparent manner in the policy dialogue with the government 
as well as in the design and discussion of cooperation programmes.

2. Country Analysis 

2.1 Context 

Ghana was the "shining star" of Africa at independence fifty years ago. The years 
1960-1964 saw relatively high growth, spurred on by favorable export performance 
and rapid industrialization linked to import-substitution policies. This encouraging 
beginning gave way to macroeconomic instability, and uneven and volatile growth 
from 1965-1 983. This uncertain foundation, hit by economic shocks, brought the 
economy close to collapse in the early 1980s. 

Recognizing the need for change, the government launched the Economic Recovery 
Program in the early 198O's, which succeeded in renewing growth and contributing to 
significant poverty reduction. A process of political liberalisation was initiated in the 
1990s which has culminated in an environment where political rights, civil liberties 
and freedom of press indicators are as positive as those achieved by some middle- 
income countries. Country assessments put Ghana at the top of the rankings in 
Africa,' and the country's leadership seeks to achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) and reach middle-income status by 2015. 

2.2 Political Developments 

The democratic process has made impressive gains in Ghana. As a result, 
Ghana's political rights, civil liberties and freedom of press rankings are not only 
amongst the best in Africa but are comparable to those recorded by countries at 
much higher levels of income.* Democracy has become a strong competitive 
advantage. 

The government understands the need to consolidate political achievements, 
and it is actively participating in the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a 
governance initiative of the African Union. Ghana was the first country to be 
reviewed under this initiative3 and to prepare a programme of action, thanks to the 
strong support of President Kufuor and the engaged participation of all stakeholders, 
including civil society. 

Governance reviews have identified some democratic deficits such as weak 
accountability and oversight of the executive and patron-client relations in the 
civil service and in government-business  interaction^.^ This situation has made 
reform of the civil service a lengthy process. 

Ghana international ranking on corruption indicators is the best among low- 
income African countr ies5 However, its ranking has slipped in the past few years, 
and a recent national survey found that 75% of all households regarded corruption as 
a serious national problem, with 80% feeling that i t had worsened in the recent past.'

The weak system o f checks and balances and politicised civil service create oppor- 
tunities where corruption can occur. The Serious Fraud Office, the Commission on 
Human Rights and Justice (CHRAJ) and civil society “watchdogs” are in place to fight 
corruption, but are not yet robust. 

Civil society is active and potentially a key driver for political governance 
reforms. Farmers’ movements, Trades Unions and Professional Associations have 
traditionally been involved in the nation’s political process. More recently, other civil 
society organisations such as “home town” development associations, women’s 
rights groups, welfare clubs, parent-teacher associations, faith based organisations 
and groups providing social services are providing renewed vibrancy to civil society 
engagement.’ The Diaspora is also increasing its involvement and has formed 
Ghanaian Home Town Associations overseas. Some advocacy groups and think 
tanks are well rooted in society, though often over-centralised in Accra.’ Civil society 
groups offer great potential to strengthen the demand for good governance and 
social accountability in government processes. 

The government recognises that participation by different social groups in 
national development is limited and needs to increase in order to reinforce 
national consensus and reduce social polarisation. The government has made 
some progress to date’ but there is much more that can be done to increase the 
voice of citizens in the development process - as proposed both by the GPRS and 
the APRM. The media is active and citizens are able to express their views on 
development issues. However, citizens are often unaware of their rights vis-a-vis 
government, and mechanisms for governmentlcitizen engagement remain 
underdeveloped. 

Progress in achieving gender equality goals has been limited. Gender equality is 
not broadly accepted as a critical development issue, and women’s exclusion from 
national processes, under-representation in public life and decision making, and 
weak entitlements to economic assets appear at odds with Ghana’s performance in 
the economic and political spheres. The government has introduced legislation and 
policies to protect the rights of women and children”, however, implementation has 
been weak. The African Peer Review Mechanism found strong cultural impediments 
to the promotion and protection of women’s rights. A number of protocols for the 
protection of the rights of children and women have not been ratified. 

Decentralisation is essential to promote citizens’ participation and to achieve 
better service delivery, but progress has been slow. Part of the delay in 
decentralizing staff and fiscal resources is due to concerns about local capacity, 
combined with the normal reluctance of ‘the center’ to lose resources and influence; 
and part of the delay is due to the complexity of managing such a process. The 2007 
budget authorized a significant transfer of civil servants from Ministries, Departments, 
and Agencies (MDAs) to district authorities, for implementation in 2008. Political 
reforms at the local level are still under discussion, as one-third of members of the 
District Assemblies and the District Chief Executives are not elected but are 
appointed by the President. Citizen Surveys report dissatisfaction with the 
performance of District Assemblies”.

Ghana has not suffered significant internal conflicts and traditional authorities 
have a recognised role in local conflict management. However, Chieftaincy-related 
disputes about land, inheritance and succession have the potential to lead to local 
conflicts.” There is also a risk that multi-party electoral contests may fuel local 
conflicts. The military is subordinated to democratic institutions. 

Ghana plays a key role in the sub-region and at the regional level. Ghana 
provides an example of successful political and economic performance in West 
Africa, a region that includes a number of countries that have experienced violent 
conflicts. Ghana is also a strong supporter of regional integration and conflict 
prevention initiatives of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) 
as well as an active participant in UN peacekeeping activities (including the Kofi 
Annan International Peace Keeping Training Centre). Recognizing Ghana’s policy of 
“good neighbourliness” and strong engagement with the APR mechanism, President 
Kufuor was elected Chairman of the African Union in January 2007. 

2.3 Economic Developments 

Ghana’s economy has registered robust economic growth rates since the year 
2000, despite sharp increases in international crude prices. Growth of real gross 
domestic product (GDP) increased progressively from 3.7% to 5.9% between 2000 
and 2005, driven by the strong performance of cocoa and gold exports. The outlook 
for 2006 appears positive, although the impact of the energy crisis which hit in late 
2006 could adversely affect growth in 2007, if underlying policy and investment 
factors are not addressed.

Macroeconomic and financial sector stability have steadily improved, removing 
two key constraints to private sector growth. Prudent fiscal and monetary 
policies have benefited from a fairly stable external environment, and have 
contributed to a decline in end-year inflation rates from 40% to 14% from 2000 to 
2005. The general decline o f the overall fiscal deficit from 9% (2001) to 3.0% in 2005, 
coupled with the decline in the domestic-debt-to-GDP ratio from 29% (2002) to 11 % 
in 2005 have impacted positively on declining interest rates.13 The declining public 
sector deficits have reduced the pressures for public domestic borrowing and 
provided scope for an increase in the share of credit to the private sector from 13.1 % 
of GDP in 2004 to approximately 20% of GDP in 2006. The positive impact of macro 
and financial stability on the private sector cannot be overestimated.

Financial sector reform is progressing and the potential for competition is well 
above most countries in the region. The financial sector is healthy and relatively 
open, with banks generally liquid and meeting prudential standards. The role of 
Government in the banking sector is limited, and new entrants from overseas have 
enhanced innovation in products and services. However, despite increased 
competition and a reduction in the prime rate, the spread between deposit rates and 
commercial lending rates remains high. The sector has benefited from a modern 
payment and clearing architecture with real-time gross settlement system since 2002, 
a more recent automation of cheque clearing and integration of rural banks into the 
electronic payments platform, and the establishment of a Central Securities 
Depository System for government and stock exchange listed securities. Measures 
have been taken in recent years to improve banking supervision (Banking Act 2004), 
promote financial deepening (Credit Rating Agency bill, Foreign Exchange bill), and 
provide safeguards against money laundering (Anti-Money Laundering bill). 

Improved macroeconomic management and sustained growth has contributed 
to Ghana's healthy debt outlook. Other factors include an improved revenue 
position, especially in the tax and duty system, and steady increases in official 
development assistance and in private  remittance^.'^ Ghana reached the HlPC 
Completion Point in July 2004. This paved the way for the country to benefit from the 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which reduced the debt stock from US$6.4 
billion to US$1.5 billion and provides new opportunities for targeted, pro-poor, public 
spending. 

Remittances and tourism are increasingly important sources of foreign 
exchange. Private transfers were estimated at about US $1.5 billion in 2005 and are 
projected to increase in the coming years. They result from Ghana's high rates of 
emigration of skilled workers15, with estimates indicating that private remittances 
originate mostly in the USA and Canada (50%) and the United Kingdom (25%).16 
Tourism receipts have also grown steadily over the past five years and are projected 
to reach US$ 1 billion in 2006." As in other regions, the human and financial 
resources of the Diaspora have an enormous potential to contribute to the develop- 
ment of the country through direct engagement with families and community groups.

Current growth rates put Ghana on track to meet the MDG on halving poverty 
levels by 2015. The latest comprehensive estimates show that the poverty 
headcount declined from 52 percent in 1991, with 36 percent living in extreme 
poverty, to 40 percent in 1999 and 15 percent of Ghanaians in extreme poverty. The 
most recent Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), which uses an asset 
rather than an income-based poverty measure, indicates that there has been a 7 
percentage point reduction from 42 percent in 1997 to 35 percent in 2003. The two 
trends are indicative of general progress, although they are not directly comparable 
with one another. Updated information on recent income poverty trends will be 
available in early 2007 once the results of the fifth Ghana Living Standards Survey 
(GLSS 5 ) are tabulated. 

Despite the recent economic expansion, the structure of the economy has not 
changed substantially. The economy continues to be largely dependent on agricul- 
ture (40% of GDP and 50% of employment)". 
It is constrained by low-productivity 
farming practices, poor infrastructure (e.g. roads, irrigation, and ICT), land tenure 
uncertainties, gender inequities, and uncertain access to inputs. Traditional exports - 
cocoa, gold and other natural resources - still account for almost half of GDP. The 
industrial sector remains relatively small and dominated by firms with low 
productiv;?. Foreign direct investment is relatively low for an economy of Ghana's 
potential. 

Although overall poverty levels are declining, socio-economic and regional 
disparities remain, and are linked to the lack of structural change in the economy. 
Weaknesses in human and social development (in terms o f investment in children 
and young people's health and education) are reflected in the gap between Ghana's 
Human Development Index (HDI) rank (138 in 2003)20 and its gradually increasing 
GDP per capita rank (121 in the same year). There is a strong urban-rural differential 
in poverty indicators, with deprivation levels substantially higher in some rural areas. 
The severity and depth of poverty is highest in three northern regions (Northern, 
Upper West and Upper East) and parts of the rural coastal zones.21 There is 
potential for growth-driven poverty reduction in these regions, but it will need targeted 
investments by Government and policy reforms aimed a t encouraging private sector 
development in these areas." Recent growth trends have fuelled the movement of 
people from rural to urban areas, where they are concentrated in sectors with limited 
employment prospects for those living in poverty. What appears to matter most in 
determining inequality and poverty in urban areas is the level of education of 
household heads. 

Ghana's trade regime is open and Ghana is a strong advocate of regional 
cooperation and integration. Exports to the EC and the USA account for 53% and 
7%, respectively, of total Ghanaian exports, while Africa accounts for 11 % of total 
exports (2002). Ghana is an important trading partner with its three neighbours and it 
is committed to the ECOWAS regional framework. In order to meet its objective of 
becoming a middle-income country by 201 5 , Ghana's non-traditional exports must 
expand also into growing regional markets.

Ghana has achieved the highest electrification rate in Sub-Saharan Africa 
(54%), and is the anchor country for the West-African Power Pool. However, fast 
economic growth combined with under-investment, poor planning, and reliance on 
seasonally variable hydropower have led to a situation where power supply is now 
unreliable and becoming a binding constraint to growth. Annual growth in electricity 
consumption is estimated to be 12%, and government‘s strategy is to increase 
access to grid electricity for domestic users from 54% to 75% by 2015. This would 
require substantial investment and improvement in managing the existing network 
and its regulation. 

Transport and communications infrastructure are in a poor state to cope with 
recent economic growth and expansion of basic service delivery, due to 
insufficient maintenance and weak strategies. Transport is key to facilitating both 
improved productivity in agriculture and agro-industry (by linking rural production to 
processing centers and trading points) and development of Ghana’s human 
resources (by ensuring rural communities’ access to schools, clinics and water 
points). Road density in Ghana is 248 km per 1,000 sq km, compared to 368 in lower 
middle-income countries and 1,015 in high-income countries. The Government has 
invested in expansion of the network; however, this expansion has not been 
accompanied by sufficient emphasis on network maintenance, with the result that 
only 34% of roads are in good condition. Currently, port capacity is under pressure 
from increased traffic: between 2004 and 2005, the volume in tonnes (imporVexport 
average) increased by I O % , container traffic increased by 15%, and the number of 
vessels increased 27%. Air traffic growth lags behind growth o f other regional hubs. 
The growth in information and communications technology (ICT) has been rapid, with 
current phone penetration at 20% (from 4% in 2000). The price of communications 
remains high, however, and quality remains relatively low. 23 

Natural resources and environment need careful management to assure long- 
term growth. Minerals, fisheries, forestry and wildlife represent 15% of GDP, 25% 
of government revenues and a substantial source of livelihood through artisanal 
activities. Inadequate potable water supply, sanitation and hygiene and air pollution 
(urban and indoor) seriously affect the burden of disease and quality of growth in the 
rapidly growing economy. Poor management of these resources, with related health 
effects, is costing Ghana approximately 10% of GDP,24 with 4% due to forestry and 
wildlife depletion and 4% due to water and air pollution. The sustainability of these 
key productive sectors and the prospects for community development and economic 
growth are put at risk by the absence of effective regulatory institutions and by 
indecisive leadership on issues related to sustaining the natural resource base and 
managing the environment. 

Institutional reforms of the public sector have had limited success to date. 
Recognition of this factor was behind the government‘s decision to create the 
Ministry of Public Sector Reform (MoPSR) in April 2005 and launch the Public Sector 
Reform (PSR) reform strategy and programme of action in March 2006. The reform 
program aims to improve performance management, remuneration, and accounta- 
bility, starting with the civil service. In addition to reform of the civil service, the 
government has developed a framework for reforming subvented agencies, and a 
new Subvented Agencies Law (Act 706) was enacted by Parliament and gazetted in 
April 2006. On the public expenditure front, poverty-related expenditures have 
increased from 6.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2003 to 8 . 5 percent in 2005, and the

government reports that budget expenditures are increasingly in line with GPRS II. 
However, policy formulation, programme implementation and the capacity to 
coordinate DP assistance need to be strengthened. Efficiency of public spending is 
low and is increasingly the focus of government attention. 

2.4 Human and Social Developments 

Progress in education has meant increasing numbers of children are entering 
school and progressing through the system. A major breakthrough was the 
abolition of mandatory school fees for basic education and the introduction of 
capitation grants through the country in the 2005/6 academic year. Non-salary 
expenditure allocations to deprived regions almost doubled over the GPRS I period.25 
As a result of some of these changes, Ghana is judged to be on track to achieve both 
MDG2 (Universal Primary Education) and MDG3 (gender parity in primary enrolment) 
by 201 5. (Ghana’s gender parity ratio a t the primary level was 0.95 in 2005). 

Improving access and quality in basic education are the central challenges. 
These include ensuring that children outside the school system (estimated presently 
at about 700,000 children) are enrolled and those at risk of dropping out are 
encouraged to complete primary education. Access problems are exacerbated for at- 
risk groups, including girls, children from deprived regions, disabled children and the 
extremely poor in rural and urban areas. There is also a persistent challenge to 
improve the quality of learning through increasing and monitoring the distribution of 
inputs. The number of qualified teachers, core textbooks, and classrooms in good 
condition must keep up with increased enrolment. All these interventions require 
increased and sustained per student funding at primary level in real terms over the 
next ten years, as well as increased and targeted programmatic funding to address 
these policy priorities. 

Gradual improvements in the delivery of a number of critical health outputs 
have taken place. A pre-paid National health Insurance Scheme introduced in 2004 
marks a new direction in health financing for poor and vulnerable groups. Recent 
indications are that the HIV prevalence rate may be dropping, although it is too soon 
to determine a trend. Malaria, however, remains a significant cause of mortality and 
costs the equivalent of 3 percent of GDP annually. 

Infant and child health indicators and maternal mortality rates appear stalled at 
high levels. Current estimates show a stagnation in neonatal mortality between 1998 
and 2003.’’ Progress in reducing infant and under-five mortality levels stalled during 
GPRS I. Child malnutrition also remains a significant problem, accounting for up to 
60 percent of the cases of child mortality and pointing to the need for a comprehen- 
sive approach to adequate nutrition, care and food security, especially amongst the 
poorest households. Infant mortality (IMR) and maternal mortality (MMR) are 
inextricably linked. Nationally estimated maternal mortality stands at 214 deaths per 
100,000 live births, although the adjusted figure published by the UN is 540 deaths 
per 100,000. In either case Ghana is off track in achieving the MDGs on both MMR 
and IMR counts. Of particular concern is that these trends have coincided with a 
period of increased health sector financing.” The next opportunity to take stock of 
trends will be the Demographic Health Survey in 2008. 

26 

25 APR 2005, Table 6.14. 
Although the latest DHS report states that the changes are small and hard to verify statistically. Problems of 
‘’ Health Sector Programme Evaluation 
measurement and inaccurate birth and death data make accurately tracking mortality trends difficult.

Access to water and sanitation services is progressing, but not as rapidly as 
needed. The approach to rural water delivery is based on community ownership 
and management. Coverage by functioning water facilities in rural areas has risen 
from less than 30% of the population in 1994 to slightly more than 50% in 2005, and 
local capacity exists to undertake water and sanitation civil works and to manage and 
operate facilities. Urban Water supply coverage is currently estimated a t 58%. The 
approach to urban water delivery is based on a utility model, with tariffs regulated by 
an independent regulator. Inefficiencies in the management of services and big 
losses of revenue resulted in the under-performance of the urban water sub-sector 
and led to a Government decision in 2006 to turn to a private service provider (PSP) 
to manage the production and distribution of water. Absence of a comprehensive 
national water policy and water sector implementation plan has constrained scale up 
in the sector, and lack of harmonized implementation approaches among DPs has 
reduced efficiency. 

With regard to sanitation services, the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply 
and Sanitation of UNICEF and WHO report an effective average access rate to 
improved sanitation facilities of 18% at the national level. Implementation of the 
Environmental Sanitation Policy (1 999) has faced considerable difficulties, posed by 
institutional problems and technical and financial capacity in the sub-sector. The low 
sanitation coverage requires innovative and sustainable approaches to latrine 
promotion and financing. Costs related to mortality and morbidity from poor water 
supply, sanitation and hygiene practices amount to 2.1 % of GDP. 

Urbanization in Ghana is accelerating. In 2000, the level of urbanization in Ghana 
stood at 44%, and this is expected to increase to 58% by 203028. Nearly 34% of the 
urban population lives in Accra (estimated to be 3 .2 million people) and in Kumasi 
(estimated to be 0.8 million). These two cities account for almost 20% of Ghana’s 
GDP *’, while the Greater Accra region alone accounts for 51% of manufacturing 
activity in Ghana 30. For cities like Accra and Kumasi, infrastructure investments are 
essential to their growth and progress. However, investments have not kept pace 
with the rapid urbanization underway, which is resulting in traffic congestion, 
environmental sanitation problems, and institutional/governance challenges for urban 
residents and local authorities. 

Gender disparities are steadily declining in some areas of basic service 
provision, such as in primary education, where Ghana has almost achieved gender 
parity. However, in areas such as reproductive health and water provision, they 
remain high and burdensome. While these problems are being addressed through a 
range of interventions by government and social institutions, Ghana has far to go in 
significantly reducing such disparities, especially in the poorest regions. 

Progress towards the MDGs 

Table 3 shows that Ghana’s progress towards the MDGs has been steady but not 
transformational. Achieving a transformational change consistent with Ghana’s 
aspiration to be a middle-income country will depend on consistently improved 
service delivery across the public sector and outreach to non-state actors through 
public-private partnerships.

3. Goals and Challenges 

3.1 The National Development Strategy - GPRS II 

Ghana’s first national Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS I) was finalised in 2002 
with the aim of generating growth, controlling inflation and increasing expenditure on 
programmes targeting the poorest and most vulnerable in society. While much of the 
government‘s macroeconomic agenda was achieved during the GPRS I period 
(2003-2005), reviews noted little room in the GPRS for addressing high-growth 
issues, as well as weak attention to gender equality, inclusion and social protection. 

A second generation GPRS was produced by government3’ in late 2005, with an 
ambitious overarching goal of raising average per capita income levels to middle- 
income levels by 2015, Le., from about US$400 to about US$ 1,000. The GPRS II 
(2006-2009) is an agriculture-led strategy which seeks to diversify the economy’s 
structure from traditional cocoa to cereals and other cash crops for export markets. 
Other sectors considered to have long-term potential include: tourism, information 
and communication technologies, light industry based on textiles and garments, and 
value-added to minerals. The GPRS II emphasizes policies to promote equitable 
growth that will be sustainable over the medium to long term. 

GPRS II presents its strategies and actions according to three thematic pillars: 
Private Sector Competitiveness; Human Resource Development; and 
Governance and Civic Responsibility. Development partners consider that the 
GPRS II, together with the recommendations of the APRM, provides an acceptable 
basis for aligning support over the short to medium term. However, the GPRS II 
would provide an even better framework for programming of external assistance 
were there greater strategic depth in the discussion of trade-offs, a more credible 
costing of GPRS II priority programs, and a robust results framework. 

If Ghana is to continue its record of strong macro-economic performance and 
achieve its goal of reaching middle-income status by 2015, including the fulfilment of 
all the MDGs, a number of constraints and challenges across the three GPRS pillars 
will need to be resolved in the short to medium term. These challenges are 
presented in the following section. 

3.2 Challenges and Strategic Priorities 

Cross-sectoral challenges 

Maintaining sound macroeconomic management and budget governance 
and improved management of domestic and external resources are essential 
for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Without a strong domestic 
revenue base and effective management of official and private resource flows, 
achieving an accelerated growth target will be significantly more difficult. 

1 Tackling pove r ty disparities will require targeted interventions to address 
growing inequities between and within regions, gender disparities in access to 
resources, services and infrastructure amenities, and the effects of long term 
natural resource depletion. Such action will be necessary i f Ghana’s human

development indicators are to improve significantly and contribute to economic 
performance. 

9 Sharing the benefits of growth is important because growing inequality and 
unsustainable growth paths have the potential to lead to political strife and 
conflict, as has been demonstrated in neighboring countries. Shared growth 
can happen in two ways. One is through ensuring that everyone has the same 
economic opportunities so that they can make a decent living and, thereby 
contribute to growth over time. The second is to put in place redistributive 
measures so that people who will not be able to work are ensured a minimum 
standard of living.

Improving the quality and productivity of all public expenditure is an 
urgent cross-sectoral priority, particularly in view of the need for enhanced 
financing of infrastructure investments to underpin growth. With current 
considerable domestic resource mobilisation and more DP resources flowing 
directly into the government budget, it is essential that Government tests for 
efficiency and value for money in public expenditure and insists on 
accountability for all public monies. 

m Absorbing large external inflows without compromising the competitive- 
ness of the export sectorwill require a strong drive to enhance the productiv- 
ity of private sector investments and improve the productivity of public sector 
spending overall. On the latter point, Ghana’s need to finance large infrastruc- 
ture investments to provide a platform for growth could lead to an expansion of 
non-concessional borrowing and a weakening in the country’s debt sustainabil- 
. Accelerating decentralization is key to improving citizens’ participation in

development. I f service delivery is to be improved and become more respon- 
sive to local priorities, the Government needs to step up the implementation of 
its National Decentralisation Action Plan, adopt a comprehensive decentralisa- 
tion policy and strategy, make progress regarding the political decentralization 
process, and ensure that functions and resources are transferred from MDAs to 
districts. 

Managing the effects of rapid urbanization in a way that is equitable and has 
positive poverty reduction impacts will require a well-functioning infrastructure 
network, a transparent regulatory environment with increased emphasis on 
coordinated urban planning, and a sound municipal governance/finance 
system. Bringing these factors together will create an enabling environment for 
private sector development. 

Reinforcing high-level coordination and dialogue to mainstream 
environment is critical. The implication of environmental and climatic factors 
for economic growth and the trade-offs that may be required across sectors 
need to be assessed systematically and routinely. Policy, regulatory, and 
incentive frameworks relating to environmental management are complex, and 
overlapping institutional mandates and outdated legislative measures can lead 
to conflicts in interpretation and program implementation. An immediate need 
exists to strengthen intersectoral coordination mechanisms to foster 
sustainable growth.

In addition to these cross-sectoral challenges, G-JAS DPs have identified a number 
of strategic priorities at the pillar and sector level which will inform their assistance 
and dialogue with the government over the G-JAS period. 

Pillar One: Private Sector Competitiveness 

The GPRS II places private sector-led development at the forefront to achieve higher 
and more broadly based growth. Modernization of agriculture and linkages to industry 
are seen as central to the structural transformation of the economy that will be 
needed to sustain higher growth and drive poverty reduction. A broad range of 
efforts will be needed to remove constraints related to sustainability and shared 
Strategic priorities across the pillar include: 

improving the enabling environment for business, including trade and financial 
services, 
facilitating stronger regional integration to stimulate productivity and trade 
links, 
enabling agricultural producers to improve productivity, diversify crops, and 
expand production for exports, 
improving access to land and security of property rights, particularly for 
women farmers, 
managing Ghana's natural resources in a sustainable and transparent way, 
scaling up investment in energy generation and distribution and in transport 
infrastructure, and 
creating the environment for more competitive and lower cost ICT services. 

Business environment 

Ghana's business environment is becoming one of the most favourable on the 
continent, but improving the enabling environment for businesses of all sizes, and 
particularly outside the main urban areas, continues to be a major challenge. 
Priorities for government action include simplifying procedures for business start up, 
allowing greater competition in the financial sector, facilitating land title and property 
registration including reducing gender differentials in access to land and credit, and 
strengthening the legal rights of creditors. Increasing investment, strengthening 
business linkages, and generating employment are major tasks for the private sector. 
Implementing the Trade Sector Support Programme and the Financial Sector 
Strategic Plan are essential to improve access to international markets and to 
financial services. Widening access to credit and affordable business development 
services is critical for enabling small and medium scale enterprises to develop. 

Trade 

Accelerating growth of regional markets will require greater integration of transport 
and communication systems among ECOWAS countries and increased 
harmonisation of fiscal and regulatory policies. ECOWAS efforts to put in place 
common external tariffs and custom facilitation measures will enhance trade and 
regional integration. Regional programmes such as the forthcoming Economic 
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU and USA lD 's West Africa Trade Hub could 
be instrumental in facilitating stronger regional integration and contributing to address 
supply-side and competitiveness constraints.

Agriculture 

February 2007 

Central to the diversification and expansion of exports needed to achieve and sustain 
higher economic growth is the modernisation of agriculture which will, in turn, spur 
pro-poor growth beyond the sector itself. These growth linkages are vital in a sector 
that has the highest proportion of workers in households in the two lowest welfare 
quintiles. The priority for a growth with poverty reduction strategy is therefore to take 
measures that enable poor producers, many of them women, to improve their 
productivity, market access and incomes alongside those with more commercial 
advantages, while at the same time sustaining their natural assets such as land (see 
Box 2) by scaling-up sustainable land management practices. Strategic priorities 
include strengthening rural infrastructure, especially rural roads and irrigation, 
improving land tenure, promoting promising value chains, enhancing access to credit 
for women and men by strengthening rural financial institutions, and strengthening 
the provision and targeting of agricultural research and extension services.

and land use patterns, as well as life cycle changes. Unequal land rights sustain and 
reproduce female poverty and exclusion. 

Natural Resources and Environmental Management 

Sustainable management of natural resources and environment is also urgent. 
Priorities include: reforming and building capacity of key regulatory agencies (for 
fisheries, minerals, forestry and environmental protection) to help them adapt and 
fulfill their mandates as subvented agencies; improving positive linkages between 
extractive industries and local communities; regularizing and assisting the related 
informal and artisanal sectors within a participatory framework; improving budget 
formulation and execution as well as public financial management; strengthening 
oversight capacity; and enhancing coordination mechanisms among regulatory 
agencies. 

Infrastructure 

Much of Ghana's desire to accelerate growth rests on a substantial scaling up of 
investment in new infrastructure, including efforts to strengthen the regulatory and 
institutional framework to attract more private sector participation, and efforts to 
improve efficiency and absorptive capacity. A significant part of the challenge also 
lies in substantially improving the management of existing infrastructure, including 
maintenance needs. Meeting the infrastructure challenge requires a fully integrated 
infrastructure platform and critical attention by government to the effective combining 
of public and private sector investments, prioritisation processes and value-for- 
money tests.

G-JAS 

Transport 

February 2007 

Improved transport links are critical to improvements in market access, factor 
productivity, and export performance as well as to enhancing Ghana’s position as a 
regional transport hub and corridor in West Africa. Priorities include: achieving a 
better balance between investment and expenditure on maintenance; providing 
better links between rural areas and markets and service centers through rural feeder 
roads; improving regional trade routes; upgrading ports to minimize delays and 
developing interchange facilities for passengers and freight; improving security and 
safety to international standards; and strengthening sector management through an 
integrated transport policy and strategic plan. 

Energy 

With rising demand and constrained supply, energy infrastructure needs to be 
significantly upgraded and expanded if the sector is not to act as a serious brake on 
future growth. Critical priorities include completing the power sector reform (including 
a management services contract for the Electricity Company of Ghana, ECG), 
expanding generation capacity to meet demand growth, stemming losses in the 
distribution system, setting retail and bulk tariffs a t cost recovery levels, and adopting 
a new energy policy that sets out a clear institutional framework for the sustainable 
expansion of access. Complementary action is called for to promote the efficient use 
of energy, gradual transition from fuelwood to modern energy (including renewable 
sources), and regional power sharing arrangements. 

Telecom/lnformation Communication Technology 

International competitiveness increasingly depends on high speed, low-cost 
communications. In the Ghana context, there is a need for more competitive and 
lower cost ICT services through tighter regulation in the short term, development of a 
national broad-band fibre-optic network, and an improved institutional framework for 
promoting private sector participation, especially in the development of a robust 
information technology industry. Opportunities for private sector operators to enter 
into partnership with Government to develop e-government applications are now 
being explored and offer potential for cost-effective roll-out of virtual services. 

Pillar 2: Human Resource Development 

The GPRS II places emphasis on expanding services to meet the MDGs and 
developing a healthy and skilled labour force to support higher growth and structural 
change. While progress has been made in expanding services in health, education, 
and water and sanitation, quality improvements lag behind. Attention to quality is vital 
to achieving and sustaining outcome improvements in learning, life expectancy, and 
child and maternal mortality. Addressing gender inequalities in school enrolment and 
access to health services is also essential to meet MDG targets and encourage 
stronger participation by women in the growth and development process. A 
commitment to social protection is likewise an essential part of delivering on a high 
and sustainable growth path. 
Strategic priorities across the pillar as a whole include: 
. . enhancing the quality and efficiency of basic service delivery, 
improved targeting of services and preventative activities to underserved 
areas and vulnerable groups, 

18 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

ensuring financial sustainability in service delivery and social protection 
measures, 
clarifying roles and responsibilities of line ministries and district governments 
and ensuring effective flow of funds to district levels, and 
focusing on the role of education and health in raising productive capacity of 
the labour force. 

Education 

Priorities in the education sector include achieving Universal Primary Enrolment and 
full completion in primary education, expanding enrolment at post-primary levels, 
promoting gender parity in secondary school enrolment, improving the quality of 
teaching and learning at all levels, and improving the relevance of post-basic 
education. The role of private providers as well as private financing also needs to be 
strengthened. Reforming tertiary education financing needs to assure sustainable 
growth, diversification and improve accountability. Further priorities include an 
emphasis on science and technology, especially ICTs in education, and a greater 
focus on skills development and training, including technical and vocational 
education and training, as a means of human resource development in line with the 
GPRS II growth agenda. 

Health 

Priorities in the health sector are focused on achieving significant declines in the 
rates of maternal and child mortality (in particular neo-natal mortality) by improving 
equitable access to quality basic health and nutrition services. Reproductive health 
interventions, with a particular focus on youth/adolescents, are likewise important 
and will lead to better health outcomes and a reduction in population growth. Malaria 
control is a continuing priority in light of its significant impact on economic growth and 
on child mortality. Collaboration with non-state service providers will increase 
effectiveness and efficiency of ‘close to client‘ delivery of a high impact service 
package. Improved management of human resources will be necessary if quality of 
services is to be improved, including policies to address the impact of health staff 
brain-drain. Likewise, consolidating the financial viability of the National Health 
Insurance Scheme will be a key element to ensuring the sustainability of health 
service delivery. Lastly, intersectoral collaboration beyond the limits of the “health 
sector” will be needed to promote health and attack the underlying causes of 
morbidity (in particular by linking with water and sanitation, environment, education, 
infrastructure, and agriculture/food security). 

HIV/AIDS 

Prevention efforts in the past have led to high levels of awareness and good 
knowledge about HIVIAIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. However, 
misconceptions still exist, risk perceptions are low, and adoption of preventative 
behaviours is still limited. Improving the level and targeting of prevention activities 
towards specific groups and geographical areas with high prevalence rates and risky 
behaviours needs to be intensified. Stigma and discrimination faced by people living 
with the virus urgently need to be reduced, alongside scaling-up anti-retroviral 
combination therapy for people with advanced HIV. 

Water and Sanitation 

Key priorities include approval o f the National Water Policy and revision of the 
Sanitation Policy, as well as preparation of related implementation frameworks. 

19 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

Prioritized investment plans for urban water, rural water, and sanitation are needed to 
provide a solid framework for scaled-up funding to the water supply and sanitation 
(WSS) sector. Strengthening of the institutional framework is needed to provide 
guidance for harmonisation and alignment of DP implementation approaches. Such 
strengthening is needed at the national level so that the sector ministry can carry out 
its lead role effectively, and district capacity development will also be needed, as 
District Assemblies take on increased responsibilities. Funding for rural water 
investments needs to be doubled i f the MDG target of 73% coverage of the rural 
population is to be met by 201 5 33, with an increasing share coming from domestic 
sources. With respect to urban water, challenges include strengthening Ghana 
Water Company Ltd. (GWCL) capacity to effectively supervise the PSP arrangement, 
integrating financial modelling into the investment planning process, increasing 
investments in urban water supply to improve access, and developing pro-poor 
approaches that will enable the utility to meet the needs of poor consumers. 

Social Protection 

Despite improving poverty trends, over 25% of the population lives in extreme 
poverty. The government has committed to developing more targeted programmes, 
both to act as a safety net and to provide an extra push to move them out of chronic 
poverty. Government capacity needs to be developed so that it can run a well- 
targeted and efficient social protection programme on a national scale, which 
addresses income poverty and facilitates access to basic services. The Ministry of 
Manpower will need to coordinate closely with MDAs and districts to avoid parallel 
programs. Interventions, such as social security payments for the elderly, for the 
food insecure, or for vulnerable children, need further support. 

Pillar 3: Governance and Civic Responsibility 

The government has significantly improved the management of public resources in 
recent years, and has made a start in attacking the backlog of broader public sector 
reform issues. Although political constraints have tended to slow implementation of 
systemic changes to the budget process, financial controls and budget accountability 
to parliament and civil society, progress is definitely being made, as evidenced by the 
Public Expenditure Financial Assessment (PEFA) and External Review of Public 
Financial Management (ERPFM) process. This offers the opportunity for accelerated 
reform to reach international value-for-money standards, the impact of which cannot 
be over-estimated for achieving a high-growth scenario. 

Cross-sectoral priorities for governance reform include: 

Upgrading public expenditure and financial management, in particular 
strengthening value for money structures related to public expenditure and 
investment. 

Reforming the civil service, with an emphasis on measuring results and 
citizens participation, and improving the transparency and accountability of 
government operations.

Implementing effective decentralisation to local authorities, including clear 
roles and responsibilities for central and local MDAs, and sufficient resources

1 Enhancing the representation and participation by women with clearer 
accountability for gender equality outcomes across government departments 
and local authorities. 

Improving statistical services and data analysis, enhancing their utilisation in 
policy and decision making, and widening information-sharing to strengthen 
social accountability. 

Public Financial Management 

Government introduced three laws in 2003 that combine to establish a strong 
framework for public financial management and accountability. However, the financial 
administration, procurement and internal audit laws are still at an early stage of 
implementation, and there is much to be done to ensure they deliver their intended 
outcomes. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) has developed 
a strategic plan which reflects challenges identified in the 2006 Review. This plan 
focuses primarily on MoFEP, but there is also a need to ensure that MDAs' and 
districts' public financial management and accountability systems are strengthened, 
including their procurement capacity and ability to screen investments against value- 
for-money criteria. Improved performance in these areas will help to limit 
opportunities for corruption. 

Public sector reform 

Strengthening the civil and public services is a key element of the Government's 
reform programme. It is essential that the reform process delivers sustained and 
measurable improvements in a transparent way and with active citizens' participation. 
As the impact of central-level public sector reforms take time to work through the 
system, focused sector-based organisational and institutional strengthening 
programmes will also be required to complement the reform agenda. Priorities for 
the coming years should include: policy coordination within ministries and across 
ministries; results-based management and accountability systems; civil service 
training; reform of central management agencies; overhaul of the public sector pay 
and pensions, with the aim of achieving consolidation and monetization of salary 
components and elimination of all non-monetary benefits and allowances; and 
development of a comprehensive human resources management strategy that would 
define clear career progressions and management functions within the civil service 
(including new career streams such as procurement and information technology). 

Strengthening oversight capacity 

According to Ghana's constitution and legislation, non-executive bodies are 
mandated to exercise strong oversight over the executive, but their performance of 
these functions is often limited in practice. For example, staffing and overall funding 
constraints have limited the scope and depth of scrutiny that Parliament and its 
standing committees can give. The Ghana Audit Service has improved its capacity to 
provide financial accountability but has not yet focused on evaluations of outcomes. 
Priorities for the future should therefore include expanding support to these 
institutions so that they can deliver their full mandate. Ghana's political traditions 
provide space for civil society organisations to comment on government 
performance, and there is additional scope for government to encourage civil society 

21 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

involvement in public policy formulation and implementation. Capacity development 
is needed for civil society organisations to build stronger coalitions, strengthen links 
with grass-roots groups, participate in development dialogues a t different levels of 
governance (including the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, EITI), monitor 
delivery of public goods, and hold government accountable for corrupt practices. 

Ensuring Gender Equity and Empowering Women 

Ghana has committed to ensuring gender equality and women's empowerment by 
signing a number of international agreements (CEDAW 1981, 2004 Solemn 
Declaration), but implementation on the ground has been slow. Priority actions 
include providing the Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs (MOWAC) with 
adequate financial resources and good quality staff to carry out its mandate of 
working with other MDAs and local government to mainstream gender into their 
policies, programs, and budgets. Government as a whole needs to more strongly 
drive MDA capacity development interventions related to gender analysis and gender 
sensitive programming. Enforcement of pending legislation, such as the Domestic 
Violence Bill, will also require concerted efforts across a range of MDAs. Finally, 
MOWAC and civil society, working with the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) and 
NDPC, need to develop their capacity to monitor and evaluate how well Ghana is 
doing in implementing its gender policies, domestic law, international agreements, 
and the APRM recommendations. 

Managing for Results 

In line with the GPRS I Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) plan, the government has 
produced an Annual Progress Report (APR) each year since 2003, to report on 
GPRS policy implementation and make policy recommendations to feed into the 
budget process. In addition to the APR, five Poverty and Social Impact Assessments 
(PSIAs) have been completed. There is increasing demand for timely and quality 
M&E from central Government, including Office of the President, Cabinet and 
Parliament. Dissemination of information has been limited historically, but this 
situation is changing, with the launch of Ghanalnfo and operationalising the NDPC 
website. The GSS is in the process of setting up a Data Centre where electronic data 
on various surveys can be easily accessed. 

The main challenges in this area relate to the need for capacity development at all 
levels. Some of the problems that persist relate to issues of staff retention and 
motivation, while others relate to defining clear institutional priorities (in work 
programmes) and coordinating donor support. Completing prioritized programmes of 
work has proven difficult, and domestic demand and support have been insufficient to 
press for necessary changes. As noted above, the dissemination culture is changing 
towards a more open regime, although there is still a need to widen access to 
information and strengthen social accountability, especially outside central circles in 
Accra. To address these challenges, i t will be important for central and line 
institutions (eg, Office of the President, MOFEP, GSS, NDPC, and MDAs) to prepare 
action plans aimed at resolving M&E related constraints and for DPs to provide 
coordinated support for their implementation. District-level M&E capacity will also 
need attention.

4 . Working Together 

Ghana faces a crucial opportunity to step-up its national development effort to 
achieve the MDGs and make progress towards middle-income status. But, as 
discussed in Chapter 3 , there are major challenges along the way requiring 
concerted efforts across the Government and strengthened partnerships with private 
sector institutions and civil society organisations. This backdrop increases the 
importance of development partners working together effectively, both to support 
Government's efforts at increased coordination and to increase the overall impact of 
assistance on GPRS II goals. The G-JAS is a significant step forward in this 
direction. 

4 . I Strategic Principles and Commitments 

The G-JAS seeks to fully align partner activities with GPRS II and to formalise the 
GPS. As described in Section 1.1, the GPS Results Matrix provides the overall 
framework for how DPs support Ghana to achieve measurable outcomes in 
accordance with GPRS II. The GPS also includes a rolling Harmonization and Aid 
Effectiveness Plan (G-HAP) based on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. G- 
JAS partners are fully committed to taking forward the G-HAP in partnership with 
Government and civil society. 

To boost progress, G-JAS partners have identified a set of strategic principles and 
commitments drawn from the G-HAP, to drive their harmonization and aid 
effectiveness efforts forward during G-JAS implementation. The broad strategic 
principles that G-JAS partners will observe in their assistance programs are to: 

increase their use of common arrangements to plan, deliver and monitor their 
development assistance, 
0 work through pillar and sector working groups to share information and, as far as 
possible, plan policy dialogue, financial support, and technical assistance with 
each other, with the government, with civil society and private sector groups, 
0 aim to use country systems to manage and implement their assistance, and seek 
to strengthen these systems in a coordinated way, and 
focus on the achievement of results through nationally driven M&E frameworks 
and support evidence-based decision-making through strengthened national 
statistics and systems for M&E. 

The commitments that G-JAS partners have made as part of the G-HAP are 
summarised in Figure 2 to facilitate ease of reference and to highlight those elements 
that G-JAS DPs can actively influence. G-JAS partners plan to set specific targets 
for these commitments early in the G-JAS cycle. Implementation and reporting 
against these commitments will take place as part of the G-HAP process, in the 
context of the CG/APM meeting each June. 

4 .2 Working Smarter 

Development partners are already working together through a range of coordinated 
programmes and common arrangements. Progress is variable, in part because of the 
lack of fully developed strategies and results frameworks in a number of sectors, the 
absence of clearly prioritised annual work plans, and the absence of a clearly 
articulated aid policy in which the government sets out its preferences for working

with DPs at central, sector and local government levels. Through the G-JAS process, 
DPs will be looking to advance dialogue with the government on these issues. 

Pillar and Sector Working Groups 

Government and DPs recognise that there is an urgent need to improve the cross- 
sector dialogue at the GPRS II pillar level. Many constraints at the sector level can 
only be overcome by concerted action in other sectors. Appropriate modalities are 
under discussion and will be clarified in the coming months. 

At sector level, progress with coordinated working is most advanced in the context of 
Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS), private sector development, transport, health, 
education, HIV/AIDS, and decentralisation, with emerging good practice in financial 
sector reform, agriculture, water and sanitation, natural resources management, 
social protection, and monitoring and evaluation. This good practice involves inter 
alia: clear leadership of the sector working group by the government; aligning DP 
assistance with a sector strategy, and, where possible, including i t in the national 
budget process; streamlining monitoring and reporting procedures around a common 
results framework; and pursuing joint policy dialogue and analytical work in 
partnership with government. 

Box 2: Sector Working in PSD and Water Sanitation 

In the Private Sector Development sector working group, the main focus for DP 
alignment is the Government's Private Sector Development Strategy and associated 
comprehensive work plan. Oversight of the work plan is provided by a joint Government- 
Private Sector Oversight Committee, and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) sets 
out how the government and DPs will engage to support delivery of the sector strategy 
and work plan. Currently 12 out of 20 DPs have signed the MOU and either joined a 
pooled fund arrangement or aligned their project support closely with the strategy and 
work plan. I t is hoped that more DPs will sign the MOU with more support made available 
either in the pool or on-budget in the near term. 

In Water and Sanitation, DP support is large relative to the Government budget, thus 
DPs are working closely with the government to strengthen the sector policy framework for 
both government and DP financed investments. DPs are funding a study of ongoing 
harmonisation and alignment efforts in the sector with a view to recommend steps to 
improve joint working and enhance the impact of assistance. Denmark and the 
Netherlands are using common arrangements for managing their funds for water and 
sanitation investments that are channelled through the Ministry of Local Government, 
Rural Development, and Environment. 

To capture these good practices and improve upon them further, a discussion paper 
was shared with Government in June 2006 which proposed that the pillar and sector 
working group architecture be rationalized to improve coordination and create a 
stronger platform for engagement around GPRS II priorities. Under this proposal, 
some sector groups would be consolidated, and a mechanism for promoting policy 
dialogue within a pillar would be put in place to enable cross-sectoral synergies and 
impacts to be addressed. Sector groups would operate according to a common 
standard, with transparent criteria for the selection of Government and DP sector 
leads. Civil society and private representatives would participate in core sector group 
activities, such as the annual sector review. A joint Government-DP working group 
reviewed and improved upon the original proposals, and forwarded its recommenda- 
tions in December 2006 for consideration at the Ministerial level. Adoption of the 

25 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

improved protocols and dissemination to MDAs for implementation would represent 
an important step towards a clearer division of responsibilities and increased 
coordination at sector level. 

Harmonisation and Reduced Transactions Costs 

One area where parallel practices by DPs have caused some difficulty over the years 
has been the payment o f allowances and per diems to Government staff. The 
ultimate preference of the DP community is to align project funding with the 
government policy framework. However this is not yet feasible as public sector 
reform has not yet dealt with this issue, and practices have emerged that distort 
government remuneration and travel policy frameworks. In June 2006, therefore, 
DPs decided to adopt a jo in t approach to allowances and local travel per diems as an 
interim standardisation mechanism, pending revision of the Government 
remuneration and travel policy framework. G-JAS DPs will adhere to the common 
practices and allowance rates defined in the joint letter to Government, and 
implementation will be monitored periodically. 

To improve harmonised working and lower transaction costs, some development 
partners have begun to share technicaVadvisory resources o r manage funds for one 
another (Box 3). There are also a number o f joint analyses and jo in t capacity 
development activities. For example, in the area o f Natural Resources and 
Environmental Management, a joint approach is emerging supported by a joint 
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) funded by the World Bank, DFID, RNE, and 
AFD. The EC is also using the CEA in the preparation o f its Environmental Profile. 
Analytic work in the transport sector is jointly planned and reviewed by DPs and the 
government, as are selected interventions in the water sector. DPs undertake jo in t 
external reviews of public financial management every 18 months, and are currently 
participating in a joint evaluation of the MDBS. 

Box 3: Silent Partnerships 

‘Silent’ or ‘delegated’ partnerships between DPs take on different forms in different 
settings. They can involve an agreement between two (or more) DPs to share 
technicaVadvisory resources in order to represent one another in policy dialogue (often 
called ‘silent‘ partnership). They can also involve one DP managing the financial 
contribution to a programme or project of another partner (sometimes called delegated 
contribution). The value of such partnerships is two-fold. First, they reduce the number 
of DPs around the policy table and make technical coordination simpler, and second, 
they facilitate the promotion of common understandings and positions among DPs. 
Currently DFlD and the Netherlands share a sector advisor in health, and DFlD and the 
EC share an advisor in transport. Proposals for additional silent partnerships exist 
between ClDA and DFlD in the agricultural sector and between the EC, Netherlands 
and DFlD in education. Currently DFlD support to the water sector is being managed by 
Denmark and GDCIKNV, although DFlD maintains a presence in policy dialogue in the 
sector. 

Further efforts to reduce the transactions costs o f aid management include the 
decision reached prior to the 2006 CG/APM to institute a national mission free period 
(MFP). The MFP (September 15 to November 15) coincides with the finalisation o f 
the national budget (a crucial time for Government) and commits DPs to not launch 
missions that would engage government colleagues in programming discussions, 
policy dialogue, or analytical work. 2006 was the first year during which an MFP 

26 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

operated, and this innovation was a critical step in ensuring that DP mission planning 
is fully aligned with the Government’s budget cycle. 

Aid Delivery and Predictabilify 

The CG/APM meeting is an important process element in improving aid predictability 
as it is timed to precede the kick-off of the annual budget cycle and provide an 
updated picture of rolling resource flows for Government planning. The evolution of 
the CGlAPM from a periodic pledging session to an annual forum for reviewing 
GPRS results, external resource flows, and mutual harmonisation commitments 
represents an important step forward in the partnership relationship in Ghana. The 
overview of actual and projected disbursements by GPRS II pillar, sector, and DP 
provides a simple but powerful tool to monitor priorities. Integrating government 
spending into this tool would enhance assessment and planning. 

The government indicated in the 2005 CG/APM communiquk its preference for an 
increased use of budget support and sector wide approaches for assisting the GPRS. 
G-JAS partners will seek to respond to this preference. Progress will depend on 
whether a clear aid policy is in place; credible sector strategies have been 
developed; and country systems are steadily being strengthened. 

Predictability in financing has already substantially improved through the MDBS, 
which is now in the position of making pre-budget funding commitments, and a 
number of coherent sector programmes are now operating. DPs are looking to further 
improve predictability, and the 4 year focus of the G-JAS is one way to achieve this. 
Further efforts to improve predictability also depend on improvements in Government 
prioritisation, medium term budgeting, value-for-money tests, and external resource 
management. 

In terms of preferred aid modalities, all active budget support donors are included in 
the G-JAS process. In selected cases partners are already planning to provide as 
much as 70 percent of their support through general and sector budget support 
instruments. However, further progress in this regard crucially depends on 
government implementing improvements to the policy framework and strengthening 
country systems for public financial management amongst other things. G-JAS 
partners using programme and project funding instruments will also align these with 
sector strategies and programmes.

5. Our Joint Response 

5.1 

Indicative Trends 

G-JAS Partners project financial flows for the 2007-2010 period of US$ 5.3 billion, of 
which two thirds would be provided on a grant basis and one third on a concessional 
credit basis. Of the assistance flowing to the government sector, US$ 1.4 billion is 
expected to be in the form of budget support and US$ 3.9 billion to be provided for 
sectoral programs. It is expected that the breakdown of sector level assistance will be 
on the order of US$ 2.3 billion for Pillar I, US$ 1.2 billion for Pillar 2, and US$ 368 
million for Pillar 3. Direct support to civil society is projected at about $58 million over 
the G-JAS period. I t should be emphasized that many DPs are not able to make 
projections for the whole four year period and that these numbers are provided to 
give an indication o f trends, subject to the qualification noted above.

5.2 Focusing our assistance 

The G-JAS Partners will support priority action areas identified in the GPRS II and in 
the APRM through sector and cross-sector programmes and projects. This section 
describes where G-JAS partners expect to focus their assistance during 2007-1 0, 
with a commitment to programme new assistance within this common framework. 
Detailed information on G-JAS partner mapping at the sector level and expected 
evolution over time is presented in Annexes 2 and 3, respectively. 

28 

 
G-JAS 

February 2007 

Pillar 1: Private Sector Competitiveness (US$ 2.3 billion) 

G-JAS partners will provide ongoing support for implementation of the trade sector 
program and the private sector development (PSD) strategy to improve Ghana’s 
access to regional and global markets and improve the business and investment 
climate for private sector investors. Specific areas include improved service quality 
and timely delivery of PSD-related public services with a particular focus on micro-, 
small, and medium enterprises; an improved legal and regulatory framework for 
business and investment; trade facilitation; a more diversified and accessible 
financial sector through implementation of the financial sector strategic plan; and 
expansion of high quality, low cost ICT services through improvements in the 
enabling environment. Sector-wide approaches (SWAPS) for PSD and financial 
sector development (FSD) are in place and will provide the framework for 
coordinating external assistance in these areas. 

To promote the productivity and diversification of agriculture and rural non-farm 
growth, G-JAS partners will support the development of a SWAP framework focusing 
on enhancing the productivity of crops, livestock and aquaculture and land resources, 
improving food security and expanding vital infrastructure including irrigation and 
supply chain development. To promote rural development more generally, partners 
are supporting sector reforms and investments in rural roads and energy and 
measures to promote micro-finance institutions and the tourism sector. Analytical 
work relating to land tenure, biosafety regulations, capacity development of micro- 
finance institutions and improving access to finance for micro-, small, and medium 
enterprises will help guide work in this area. 

To sustain growth and poverty reduction, G-JAS partners will pursue opportunities to 
provide harmonized support to natural resources and environmental governance in 
line with emerging government priorities for fisheries, forestry and wildlife, mining and 
overall environmental protection. G-JAS support will focus on regulatory institutions, 
related artisanal activities, engagement with non-State actors, strengthening the 
oversight capacity of non-executive bodies, public financial management, and linking 
with global initiatives to which Ghana is committed on extractive industries, forest 
governance and trade, and illegal fishing. Support to measures towards minimising 
the impact of climate variability and change will also be initiated. 

As a vital input to higher and more widely shared growth, G-JAS partners will 
prioritise their support according to an integrated transport strategy and Transport 
Sector Development Programme with an emphasis on: enhanced maintenance; 
increased access to market through improvement in rural feeder roads; improved 
circulation and transit times in urban centers; improved transport links critical to West 
Africa regional trade; and increased use of private financing across the sector. The 
sector group is reviewing how to enhance the sectoral programmatic framework 
applying to both domestic and external funding. 

In energy, the priority for G-JAS partners is to continue supporting implementation of 
power sector reforms to improve the sector’s financial viability, and to expand the 
supply of energy services while protecting the poor. In addition, G-JAS partners will 
support the West.Africa Power Pool and West African Gas Pipeline Projects, scaling- 
up access to clean, modern energy for households and public facilities, expansion of 
generation, and improving operation of the power system. Analytical work will 
provide needed analysis and an outline of an energy regulatory framework. The 
transition to clean fuel sources for household energy use is expected to contribute to 
reduced respiratory infections and improved health status among the population in 
general, and children in particular. 

29 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

Pillar 2: Human Resource Development (US$ 1.2 billion) 

The GPRS II emphasises the centrality of Human Resource Development to the 
achievement of faster and shared economic growth. G-JAS partners will support the 
government's efforts to enhance the role of the education, health, and water/ 
sanitation sectors in raising the productive capacity of the population, enabling them 
to work more effectively in the productive sectors of the economy. 

In support of improved educational outcomes and accelerated achievement of the 
MDGs, the G-JAS partners will focus on increasing access, completion and quality in 
basic education, particularly the six-year cycle of primary schooling, and specific 
measures, such as incentive schemes, to increase girls' enrolment, retention and 
completion, particularly in secondary education. G-JAS partners will work with the 
Ministries of Education and Finance to improve efficiency and equity in education 
financing at all levels, particularly in pursuit of a more sustainable and equitable 
system of funding for tertiary education. Partners are working with government to 
develop a SWAP within which support will be provided. 

In health, G-JAS support will focus on increasing access to basic health and nutrition 
services for the poor; strengthening reproductive health care and linking it with HIV/ 
AIDS control; and establishing sustainable financing arrangements with protection of 
the poor. The desired result is to improve neonatal, infant, and maternal mortality 
trends. Greater efficiency and higher health worker productivity will be promoted 
through a better mix o f skills, equipment, transport, communication, and commodi- 
ties. Delivery of a high impact yielding services package will be supported through 
the steady expansion in underserved areas of the network of health centres and 
district hospitals, gradually extended by community based health planning services 
compounds. Evidence based learning and planning will be enabled by a 
comprehensive Health Management Information System, supplemented by policy 
related research. Regulation of the health and nutrition sector will be a relatively 
small but important aspect of G-JAS support. G-JAS partners will give priority to 
strengthening the SWAP arrangement and its effective linkage to the MDBS 
framework, with particular attention to the governance agenda, including 
decentralisation and public financial management. 

To reduce the impact of HIVIAIDS, G-JAS partners will continue to support enhanced 
management of the HIV/AIDS response, increased targeting of prevention 
intervention, and scaling up of the provision of antiretroviral combination therapy for 
people with advanced HIV. Partner support is currently channeled through common 
arrangements in support of the Government's Universal Response programme, 
coordinated by the Ghana Aids Commission. In an environment of increasing budget 
support, opportunities for pooled funding and for integrating HIV/AIDS control 
measures into governmentkector ministries' work programs will be pursued (relevant 
elements of universal access). 

On water and sanitation, G-JAS partners will support the implementation of the 
National Water Policy and the Strategic Investment Plan for Rural Water, with plans 
to develop a SWAP. In line with the decentralisation process and in parallel to the 
reinforcement of district capacities, their interventions will be directed to and 
implemented by District Assemblies. In addition G-JAS partners will support the 
updating and implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan for Urban Water and 
the National Sanitation Policy. To enhance sustainable management of water 
resources, partners will seek the development of a National Integrated Water 
Resources Management plan. 

30 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

G-JAS partners will support implementation of the National Social Protection Strategy 
by providing co-ordinated support for capacity development of the Ministry of 
Manpower and for the design and implementation of new programmes, and financial 
assistance in scaling these up nationally. G-JAS partners will work with the 
government to refine poverty targeting of protection programmes. 

Pillar 3: Good Governance and Civic Responsibility ( U S 3 6 8 million) 

To further strengthen democratic practice and public accountability G-JAS partners 
will provide support to oversight, human rights, and justice institutions. 

G-JAS partners will support decentralisation reforms through the National 
Decentralization Action Plan. On the basis of a comprehensive decentralization 
policy and implementation strategy, G-JAS partners will seek to develop a coherent 
and coordinated support modality. Partners aim to move towards harmonized support 
for capacity development of local governments and the delivery of local public 
services, and towards harmonized arrangements for district development funding. To 
address urbanization challenges, support would focus on developing well-functioning 
infrastructure networks, transparent regulatory environments, and sound municipal 
governancelfinance systems (particularly for those districts that are classified as 
municipalities or metropolitan areas). It is the understanding of the G-JAS partners 
that support to sector or cross-cutting programs at district level will be fully aligned 
with the objectives and implementation arrangements of the decentralization agenda. 

Support for the government’s Public Sector Reform Strategy will continue via multiple 
initiatives including economic management capacity development, support for 
pensions reform, and use of e-government applications to improve service delivery 
and increased productivity in the public service. Some DPs are participating in a 
pooled mechanism for a SWAP, and the intent is to expand G-JAS partner 
participation within this framework over the G-JAS period. G-JAS partners will 
encourage transparency and citizen participation in the Public Sector Reform 
process. 

Improved interaction between Parliament, traditional authorities, and civil society 
groups will be supported through coordinated DP initiatives, although mechanisms 
are yet to be defined. Traditional authorities will be supported to assume a 
constructive role in national development and the modern nation-state, in particular in 
local land and judicial administration as well as in extra-judicial dispute settlement in 
conformity to the requirements of rule-of-law and national policies. Access to 
resources, justice and good local administration for women and vulnerable groups 
will be supported as a matter of paramount importance. G-JAS partners will also 
support initiatives that aim to increase transparency and reduce opportunities for 
corruption, by strengthening the oversight capacity of non-executive institutions and 
civil society organizations. 

Improvements to budget formulation and execution processes and public financial 
management reform will continue through MDBS support and individual DP projects 
in public procurement, revenue mobilization, and debt management. Upcoming 
ERPFM exercises will focus on issues Government considers critical to improving 
value for money and accountability in the use of public resources, using the PEFA 
PFM Performance Measurement Framework and the World Bank-OECD/DAC good 
practices on strengthening procurement capacities. 

G-JAS partners will support the establishment o f a robust national M&E system that 
generates regular reports on GPRS II implementation results and information for use 

31 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

in evidence-based decision-making. In this context, DPs will work with GoG to 
enhance GSS and MDA capacity to produce reliable statistics and meaningful 
analysis in a timely manner. Partners will also encourage the government to engage 
civil society in its M&E efforts. Specifically, G-JAS partner support will be focused on 
the NDPC, GSS, the Office of the President, and MoFEP, working within the 
framework of a coordinated technical cooperation programme and prioritised 
institution-specific action plans. M&E capacity-development a t the MDA and district 
level will also be supported within a harmonised framework. 

To promote gender equality and empower women, and reach MDG 3 targets, G-JAS 
partners will support government and civil society to integrate gender equity issues 
and considerations into key national development documents; strengthen MOWAC in 
its role as policy co-ordinator on gender as well as in its horizontal relationship with 
MDAs; and advocate for a greater allocation of resources in the national budgeting 
process for women’s empowerment. At the sector level, G-JAS partners will 
integrate gender concerns in policy dialogue and operational support programmes 
wherever appropriate and feasible. 

5.3 Joint Programming Principles 

To accelerate movement to joint programming during the G-JAS period, partners 
have decided to apply some key principles to guide programming choices in the short 
to medium term. These programming principles, which are listed below, are fully 
compatible with the strategic principles listed in Figure 2 . Specifically, G-JAS 
partners will work within the framework of pillar and sector groups to: 

define priorities for new assistance and modalities for coordination. 
develop full SWAPS and programme-based aid (PBA) frameworks where they 
do not yet exist. 
enhance coordination and complementarity between different aid modalities 
so as to maximize their combined effectiveness. 
develop and deliver coordinated technical assistance programs; untying and 
pooling of TA will be explored wherever desirable for achieving development 
results. 
consider restructuring on-going programs to enable greater alignment and 
more harmonized aid delivery when new PBA frameworks come into effect. 
increase predictability by making multi-year commitments wherever feasible, 
and sharing projected information on financial flows and strategic planning 
options with the government and DPs at least every six months. 
explore opportunities for increasing the use of delegated financing 
arrangements to reduce implementing agency transaction costs.

6. Results Framework and Risk Assessment 

6.1 G-JAS Monitoring and Review 

Meeting GPRS II goals and targets requires a strong focus on results by Government and 
G-JAS partners, while monitoring and evaluation is essential in promoting accountability. 

The G-JAS will be monitored in two ways. First, the assistance programme will be monitored 
through the GPS Results Framework which maps DP assistance to GPRS II and APRM 
priority actions. Second, the commitment to joint working will be monitored as part of 
country-level monitoring of the Paris Declaration commitments through the G-HAP. 

The G-JAS will draw on existing structures and sources as far as possible. Data sources will 
include the APR of the GPRS II, the APRM Progress Review, the annual MDBS 
assessment, G-HAP progress reports, Paris Declaration surveys, and, eventually, an 
independent mutual accountability review. 

Development results. Until the national monitoring framework for GPRS II is finalised, G- 
JAS DPs will use the current version of the GPS results matrix for monitoring G-JAS 
contributions. The matrix shows (i) GPRS outcomes, (ii) intermediate sector level indicators, 
(iii) Government strategies and actions, and (iv) specific interventions of development 
partners designed to contribute to the achievement of GPRS outcomes. 

Once Government's GPRS II monitoring framework is finalised (expected by March 2007), 
the GPS results matrix will be updated to incorporate those GPRS II indicators and national 
targets which correspond to areas of G-JAS support. This will enable G-JAS partners to rely 
on annual country assessments o f GPRS II results to judge the development effectiveness 
of the G-JAS, and avoid setting up a parallel monitoring or reporting system. 

Partnership results. In addition to the annual monitoring of the development effectiveness of 
G-JAS support described above, there will also be annual monitoring of the G-JAS partner- 
ship through regular G-HAP progress reports. To complement these self-assessments, 
there will be a mid-term review of the G-JAS in 2008, and a full evaluation o f G-JAS 
commitments at completion (2010), carried out by an independent team of evaluators. 

Timing. To maximise the benefits of the joint assistance strategy, monitoring and review will 
be fully aligned with the GPRS II review cycle and government budget calendar (Figure 3). 
The findings of the annual G-JAS review will be discussed each June during the CG/APM 
meeting. 

6.2 Mutual Accountability Framework 

The government and DPs have committed to put in place an independent mechanism for 
assessing the aid partnership as a critical input to improved mutual accountability for 
development results. The purpose of an independent assessment mechanism is to 
generate an objective status report on the quality of the partnership, including 
recommendations for how it can be improved for the achievement of results. 

G-JAS partners will engage government, civil society, and private sector partners in 
identifying and evaluating options for the establishment of an independent mechanism. The 
aim will be to ensure engagement of as many key stakeholders to the aid relationship as 

33 

G-JAS 

February 2007 

Major slippage in implementing GPRS I1 and APRM recommendations could undermine 

confidence and reduce the ability of Ghana to maintain current aid levels and attract new 
external funding. G-JAS partners will work with the government on aligning assistance to 
GPRS II priorities to reduce the likelihood of such slippages. In addition, to increase the 
likelihood that delays are caught early, G-JAS partners will work closely with the government 
to improve the overall architecture of the aid dialogue through the creation of GPRS II pillar 
structures and the strengthening of sector working groups, to complement the existing 
MDBS working group. The institution of regular outcome reviews at CG/APM annual 
meetings will provide an additional forum for discussing development results. 

Changes in the global aid policies of DPs determined at head-quarter level could conflict 
with aid effectiveness practices observed at the country level. This could lead to difficulties 
in maintaining the G-JAS consensus around harmonisation issues. G-JAS partners 
undertake to brief capitals on harmonisation progress in Ghana, inconsistencies in 
organisational global policies and, where adverse changes in global policy occurs, to keep 
in-country partners appraised of the possible consequences of these changes. 

Increasing levels of support from new and emerging donors that are not aligned to the G- 
JAS harmonisation consensus in Ghana could undermine aid effectiveness and have 
adverse effects on government capacity to manage aid. G-JAS partners will encourage new 
and emerging donors to participate in existing DP-government dialogue mechanisms and 
will maintain an open door policy for DP coordination mechanisms. 

Experience from other countries suggests that political instability or deteriorating 
governance indicators could result in a breakdown in the DP consensus on how to engage 
with the government. This risk is considered low given the current positive trends in political 
governance in Ghana, and can be mitigated by further strengthening the policy dialogue 
structures mentioned above. 

Similarly, poor macroeconomic management or undue recourse to non-concessional 

capital markets could result in an unravelling of the DP consensus as well as fewer 
commitments of new external resources to Ghana. G-JAS partners will maintain a high level 
policy dialogue on budget issues as part of the MDBS framework and at sector level as well. 
With respect to non-concessional borrowing, G-JAS partners commit to assist the 
government with advisory services so that market access, when it occurs, is strategic and 
sustainable. The range of support anticipated includes detailed assessments of Ghana’s 
investment needs based on multiple expenditure and growth scenarios; identification and 
assessment of Ghana’s medium- and long-term financing options; and capacity 
development related to assessing the viability of investment proposals considered for 
external non-concessional borrowing.

7. Next Steps 

7.1 The Way Forward 

February 2007 

While concerted efforts to improve joint working and programming are underway, there is 
still some distance to go before partner programmes are fully coordinated with one another 
and aligned with sector programmes and priorities. Progress on outcomes and results will 
also depend on the government moving forward with its own reform programme and 
engaging actively with DPs on the harmonisation and alignment agenda. 

As the G-JAS is a milestone in an on-going process rather than the end of a journey, the G- 
JAS partners commit themselves to a series of next steps to further deepen joint working 
and programming as part of G-JAS implementation: 
' G-JAS partners involved in the MDBS process are committed to strengthening the 
multi-year performance framework (PAF), seeking both greater alignment with GPRS 
II targets and greater reliance on outcome indicators. Consultations between DPs 
and government on the next iteration o f the MDBS PAF (2007-09) have a target 
completion date of end-February 2007. 

. 

G-JAS partners commit to operationalise jointly with government the recommenda- 
tions on pillar coordination and sector working groups developed by the joint 
. G-JAS partners are committed to aligning the GPS results matrix on the final GPRS 
government-DP working group. The goal is to have pillar and sector groups 
operating under the new guidelines by end March 2007. 
II indicators and targets, so that full alignment is achieved. Once G-JAS partners 
receive the final national indicator set (expected by end March 2007), the next steps 
will involve working through the sector groups and sector leads to select which 
indicators and targets are most relevant to DP assistance programs and then 
revising the GPS results matrix. This process should be completed by end April 
. G-JAS partners plan to translate the partnership commitments contained in the G- 
2007. 
JAS into concrete targets for 2010. The next steps in this process will be to review 
the country-specific targets generated by the 2006 Paris Declaration baseline survey 
to assess whether these should become the G-JAS targets or if there are additional 
actions or higher achievement levels that the group wish to consider. The goal is to 
have a proposal ready for endorsement by the June 2007 CG/APM meeting. 

' 

. 

G-JAS partners and government committed ourselves at the June 2006 CG/APM to 
develop a framework for independent monitoring of the aid partnership in Ghana. 
The next steps involve forming a joint group to define what should be monitored, how 
frequently, who should do the monitoring, and how civil society and the private sector 
should be involved. The working group will be formed in early 2007, with the goal of 
submitting a draft proposal for endorsement to the June 2007 CG/APM meeting. 

G-JAS partners plan to initiate in early 2007 a comprehensive exercise that will 
establish how to be more selective in our financial programming, policy dialogue and 
technical cooperation and how to concentrate our efforts in line with our comparative 
advantages. To reach its full potential this division of labour exercise will involve the 
government at the earliest opportunity. The target date for initial discussion of 
recommendations on this theme would be a t the June 2007 CG/APM meeting.

World Bank Program with Ghana 

A. 

STRATEGIC FOCUS 

1. 

The World Bank w i l l support Ghana in implementing its Growth and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (GPRS 11) to achieve middle-income status and the Millennium Development Goals, and to 

ensure that the benefits of growth are shared. T h e W o r l d B a n k ’ s strategy i s anchored in the 
Consu l ta t ive G roup ’s f r am ew o r k o n Results, Resources and Partnership. T h e p roposed strategy f o l l ow s 
t h r o u g h o n comm i tmen ts made unde r the Ghana Jo in t Ass is tance Strategy (G-JAS). T h e ove ra rch ing 
ob jec t ives o f the strategy are t o suppor t Ghana to : (i) sustain econom ic g r o w t h o f a t least 6% pe r year; 
(ii) surpass the 2015 Millennium D e v e l o pm e n t G o a l o f h a l v i n g p o v e r t y t o 26% a lready during this 
C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy (CAS) pe r iod ; and (iii) start t o reduce inequa l i t ies . 

2 . 

The World Bank w i l l support Ghana’s ove ra l l development efforts both through general 
budget support in the form of a se r ies of poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) and further 
analytical and financial support to the three pillars of GPRS 11, by: (i) r a i s i n g p r i v a t e sector 

compe t i t iveness t h r o u g h engagements in p r i v a t e and f i n a n c i a l sector deve lopmen t , the m o d e r n i z a t i o n o f 
agr icu l ture , sustainable na tu ra l resource management, in f ras t ruc tu re and i n n o v a t i v e l y , em p l o ym e n t 
po l ic ies ; (ii) im p r o v i n g h um a n deve lopmen t outcomes, with in te rven t ions in the hea l th , education, wa te r 
and sanitation, and soc ia l p r o t e c t i o n sectors; a n d (iii) s treng then ing governance t h r o u g h ac t iv i t ies in

ev idence a n d results-based p u b l i c p o l i c y cho ice . 

3. 

This strategy i s built t a k i n g i n t o accoun t : (i) governmen t ’s ind ica t ions o f i t s demand f o r W o r l d 
B a n k assistance in ce r ta in sectors; (ii) lessons f r o m a series o f b r o a d deve lopmen t d ia logues and f r o m the

The governance foundations for Ghana’s development are strong, but for Ghana to break 
out of its low-income status and meet its middle-income aspirations, it needs to step up its 
governance performance. As Ghana tu rned fifty o n M a r c h 6 2007, i t l o o k e d b a c k a t a quarter cen tu ry o f

Box 2: Emerging Findings o f Analytical Work on Shared Growth 

In September, the Wor ld Bank launched work on a Country Economic Memorandum, w i th strong participation b y the 
M in is try o f Finance and Economic Planning, the National Development Planning Commission, Ghanaian research 
institutions and other partners. Results o f a first phase w i l l be presented at the Consultative Group meeting June 18-19 
2007, w i th the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) being finalized in 2008. 
Ghana has accelerated economic growth and i s en route to achieve the key poverty millennium development 
goal (MDG ) well ahead o f schedule, although there i s some evidence that inequality i s growing. Overall, 
Ghana’s robust growth over the past 15 years was remarkably poverty reducing. Even taking in to account the 
significant population growth, the number o f poor people was reduced b y 1.7 million, from 7.9 m i l l ion in 1991 to 
6.2 m i l l ion in 2006. I t may be harder to reduce poverty at the same rapid pace in future years given that those who 
remain very poor today tend to be concentrated in regions w i th fewer opportunities for growth and there i s some 
evidence that inequality has grown. A t the same time, however, there are now better opportunities for targeted 
po l icy interventions and programs precisely because poverty i s more concentrated in the northern part o f the 
country. 
Ghana’s accelerated growth i s not just a result o f high gold and cocoa prices but also due to improving 
economic policy environment and investment climate, rising amounts o f investments, and increasingly 
harmonized aid. Ghana i s now, w i th Tanzania and Uganda, one o f the strongest po l icy performers among low- 
income African countries, w i th Country Po l icy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) at 3.9, at a par with, for 
example, Vietnam. Ghana now invests about 30% o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and attracts strong donor 
support, w i th donors reporting increasing actual disbursements from about $700 m i l l ion in 2002 to above $1200 
m i l l ion in 2006. W h i l e past growth was ma in ly driven b y factor accumulation, more recently there i s indication o f 
gradual productivity increases, including from small cocoa farms. 
Nevertheless, Ghana continues to face important growth constraints and risks. Ghana needs to further 
increase agricultural productivity while preserving its land resources asset, w i th greater use o f technology, 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the participation b y the private sector. Important 
infrastructure gaps need to be addressed, particularly in energy, water and transport. Although Ghana has improved 
its ranking in the Do ing Business index, i t started from a l ow base and further improvements are needed. Ghana 
needs to reinforce its fiscally prudent approach, including f ind ing a long-term solution to the size o f the wage b i l l 
and consistent implementation o f government’s full cost w i th broad based jobs creation being the strongest 
recovery po l icy in public u t i l i t i e s related to important infrastructure gaps. 
The determinants o f persistent poverty and inequality are many. The significantly higher poverty rates in rural 
Ghana have several causes. The ago-c l ima t ic conditions in Northern Ghana lead to stagnant yields in food staples. 
The overall constraints to private sector activity and access to serv ices are more severe in rural areas, further 
encouraging agglomeration to major urban centers. Urbanization i s accelerating and i s projected to reach 5 8% b y 
2030. Though urban l i v i n g standards have grown on average, urban poverty i s also a cause o f concern, w i th 
poverty in Accra, for example, having increased to 10.6% in 2005. Inequality appears to have worsened from 0.32 
in 2000 to 0.35 in 2005, as measured b y the consumption gini. These disparities are o f concern s ince shared 
growth generates higher growth. Broad-based jobs creation, in a growing economy, i s the strongest factor behind 
reducing poverty and diminishing inequality. Further analytical work and po l icy dialogue w i l l need to determine 
the ro le o f employment po l icy in Ghana’s development strategy. 
Ghana’s progress on indicators o f gender equality has not kept pace. Bo th the GPRS I1 and the A fr ica Peer 
Review Mechanism s t ress the importance o f gender equality and women’s advancement for Ghana’s aspirations. 
Government has la id the foundations through policies, legislation, and an institutional framework on women’s 
rights. Implementation o f such policies remains weak. Because o f the lack on data to demonstrate gender equality 
as an economic growth issue, the topic often does not receive the attention in po l icy dialogue at the h igh levels that 
i t requires. Gender division in agricultural labor and access to resources and technology, for example, l ike ly has 
implications for productivity, innovation, and household food security. 

Ghana appears to be a prime candidate fo r scaling up financial support, provided government also adopts a 
stronger value-for-money approach. There are clear bottlenecks in the provision o f public goods such as 
infrastructure. A value-for-money approach to public sector expenditure and public-private partnerships i s now a 
h igh pr ior i ty . The authorities are intent to improve management in key areas such energy, agriculture, water and 
sanitation. A n intensified partnership to scale-up both results and resources should be sought.

The World Bank Program results framework i s derived from Ghana’s developmental 
aspirations as articulated in the GPRS II and the continuous evolution o f government’s sector

the concess iona l i ty o f IDA terms in F Y 0 9 . 

26. 
I t i s critical that Ghana pursues a prudent stance on non-concessional debt, in terms of both 
borrowing volumes and the choice o f projects to be financed by non-concessional means. In this 

regard, there are three cons idera t ions tha t shou ld i n f o r m Ghana’s strategy. First, a n increase in the risk o f 
deb t distress, f o r examp le f o l l o w i n g h i g h e r v o l um e o r less-concessional-than-anticipated ex terna l 
b o r r ow i n g , c o u l d l e a d t o a change in Ghana’s status f r o m a “green light” t o a “ y e l l ow light” coun t ry .

accompany ing 10 pe rcen t cu t in the o v e r a l l v o l um e o f comm i tmen ts . Second, because Ghana i s a 
b e n e f i c i a r y o f the MDRI, IDA’s p o l i c y o n non-concess iona l b o r r o w i n g applies, and the t e r m s and v o l um e

27. 
While there a re many factors that w i l l influence the size o f IDA’s program in Ghana this 
CAS presents an indicative lending program that assumes I D A lending levels similar to those o f the 
IDA14 period in r e a l terms (excluding the accommodation o f MDRI): approximately $315 million 

per year. H ow e v e r , as one o f the t o p pe r fo rme rs in A f i i c a , Ghana c o u l d p r o d u c t i v e l y absorb h i g h e r

Government has made clear to the Bank and to other development partners that additional 
resources a re needed to finance critical infrastructure investments over the coming four years, and 
has asked partners to explore the possibility o f providing additional concessional resources above

Overall, the Bank has played a vital role in f inanc ing Ghana’s progress towards GPRS goals,

the FY04-07 CAS - its results framework, which includes outcomes that are not sufficiently linked to 
the Bank’s program and lacks adequate milestones to monitor progress.

The PRSC has helped Ghana’s progress in implementing the provisions of the Public

G - JAS and the Bank ’s C A S foresee an increased use o f these sector b u d g e t suppor t opera t ions over the

Ghana-Joint IMF and World Bank External Debt Sustainability Analysislg 

Summary 

1. 

The result o f the debt sustainability analysis indicates that Ghana’s risk o f debt distress i s 

moderate,20’21’zz albeit close to the low risk category, In the m e d i um t o l o n g term , Ghana’s p ro jec ted 
deb t b u r d e n t ra jec to ry breaches just one o f the three c omm o n l y used i n d i c a t i v e thresho lds (the NPV o f 
deb t - to -GDP ra t io) , and re turns t o a d ow nw a r d p a t h thereafter. U n d e r this stress test, a sharp dec l ine in 
the GDP de f la to r and, consequently, a sharp r i s e in the im p o r t bill, c om b i n e d with m u c h l o w e r net curren t 
transfers, leads t o a w i d e n i n g o f the curren t accoun t de f ic i t in 2007 and 2008, respec t ive ly . These curren t 
accoun t de f ic i ts are then p ro jec ted t o b e f inanced p r im a r i l y a t nonconcess iona l terms. Thus, w h i l e one 
canno t r u l e o u t a n ex terna l shock o f such magn i tude , the p r o b a b i l i t y o f such a shock o c c u r r i n g i s v e r y

The baseline scenario assumes the continuation o f trends in current economic reforms. 

These r e f o rm s inc lude : (i) c o n t i n u e d mac roeconom ic s tab i l iza t ion (pruden t f i s c a l stance, s ing le -d ig i t

and e f f i c i e n t use o f b o r r ow e d funds. In the mean t ime , rem i t tances are assumed t o r em a i n constant as a 
share o f G D P (at 15 percent), w h i l e FDI i n f l o w s are expected t o increase g radua l ly . In te rna t iona l reserves 
w o u l d exceed 4 mon ths o f im p o r t s a t the end o f the p r o j e c t i o n p e r i o d . T h e base l ine scenario also

annua l m a r k e t access o f abou t 1 percen t o f GDP f o r the res t o f the p r o j e c t i o n p e r i o d . In m a k i n g these 
assumptions abou t nonconcess iona l b o r r ow i n g , the analysis attempts t o b e rea l is t ic with r e g a r d t o 
c omm e r c i a l b o r r o w i n g vo lumes a n d t o i l lus t ra te the va lue o f prudence and the impo r tance o f the j u d i c i o u s
