Introduction

This Progress Report assesses the implementation of the FY11-FY14 joint Bank-IFC
1.
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Albania and sets out planned activities for FY13 and
14. The CPS identifies three strategic objectives for World Bank Group (WBG) support: (i)
supporting a recovery in economic growth by improving competitiveness through fiscal
consolidation, better public sector management, an improved business climate, deeper access to
credit and reduction of infrastructure bottlenecks; (ii) sustaining and broadening social gains
through enhanced social protection and more effective social services; and (iii) reducing
vulnerability to climate change through improved water resource and disaster management.
2.
The objectives and pillars of the CPS remain unchanged since its preparation in FY11,
but the prolonged volatility in Eurozone economies since 2008 points to the need for increased
emphasis on reducing economic vulnerabilities and supporting economic growth. In this
context, the Bank allocated an additional US$275 million to help Albania respond to the
Eurozone crisis through increased support for the financial sector, structural reforms and social
protection - allowing for a total program under this CPS of up to US$575 million. To date, the
Government has made progress towards realizing CPS milestones and outcomes in a number of
areas, although fiscal consolidation has remained an elusive goal. High levels of public debt and
a sensitive dialogue on fiscal consolidation have thus far limited the absorption of CPS financing
through development policy operations. Going forward, the dialogue will continue toward a
satisfactory fiscal framework, and the Bank will diversify planned lending instruments to better
support growth and reduce economic vulnerability.
Most investment projects have met or are
meeting their development objectives. Challenges have remained, however, in supporting
improved financial performance and reliable supply in the energy sector. A strong knowledge
program supported by IBRD and IFC has been an important part of the partnership strategy, in
addressing the economic crisis as well as supporting sector level reform programs. IFC's
program complemented IBRD's efforts in private sector development. During FYI 1-13 (as of
March 25), IFC significantly increased its program in the country, investing in six projects
totaling about US$125 million. Details of progress to date and updated performance indicators
are reflected in the Results Matrix (see Annex 1).
II.

Country Context

3.
Relations between Albania's two main political parties remain tense, but there has
been cooperation on the EU accession reform agenda leading to an EC recommendation that
the country be granted EU candidate status if progress continues. Following the close elections
of 2009, the ruling Democratic Party (DP) formed what has proven to be a relatively stable
governing coalition with a smaller party, the Socialist Movement for Integration. The coalition
has been able to move forward with its agenda in most cases. However, legislation requiring a
three-fifths majority has been more difficult to pass by the DP and its main opposition, the
Socialist Party (SP). Since November 2011, the two parties have come together to deliver on
substantial reforms identified by the EC in its 2010 Opinion as pre-requisites for EU candidate
status. Most recently, the parties came together to pass laws on electoral reform, administrative
courts and elimination of the exemption from prosecution for high officials. In light of these
developments, the October 2012 EC Progress Report has recommended that Albania be granted
candidate status by the EU Council subject to completion of key measures in the areas of judicial
and public administration reform and revision of the parliamentary rules of procedure.
1

4.
With a large majority of the population supporting EU membership, EU accession
remains a key driver of reform in public policy. In this regard, particular focus will be placed
on: conducting elections in line with European and international standards; strengthening the
independence and accountability of judicial institutions; combating corruption and organized
crime; reinforcing protection of human rights and antidiscrimination; and implementation of
property rights. The successful conduct of Parliamentary elections in 2013 will be a crucial test
of commitment to the new electoral reform and is a pre-condition for opening EU membership
negotiations.
5.
Since the 2008-09 globalfinancial crisis, growth has remained subdued. After the precrisis decade of a 6 percent average growth rate, growth fell to 3.3 percent in 2009. The crisis led
to lower remittances and exports, which in turn contributed to lower growth and fiscal revenues.
GDP grew by 3.5 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in 2011, supported mainly by services and
industry.
6.
Albania's growth outlook has weakened substantially due mainly to the continued
deterioration of the external environment. Like all countries in Southeast Europe, Albania has
been hit hard by the prolonged crisis in the eurozone. Given its close links to the Greek and
Italian economies via exports and through remittance and financial flows, the sovereign debt
crisis affecting these key economic partners has dampened the growth outlook for Albania.
Growth in 2012 has been estimated at 0.8 percent. With the Eurozone crisis lingering, growth in
Albania is projected to remain modest averaging just 2 percent between 2012 and 2015 (Table
1).

While an expansionary fiscal policy helped mitigate the negative effects of the global
crisis in 2009, fiscal space is now exhausted and public debt is projected to exceed 60 percent
of GDP in 2012 and 2013. The fiscal stimulus, which started in 2008, consisted of elevated
public investments (mainly on roads) and increases in public salaries and pensions. The resultant
rise in fiscal deficits, combined with a 10 percent depreciation of the Lek, brought public debt
levels close to 60 percent of GDP, the legal limit set in 2008. In 2010, with fiscal space tight and
revenue growth slowing, the Government cut expenditures by 9.5 percent at mid-year, reducing
the fiscal deficit to 3.1 percent of GDP (from 7 percent in 2009). Another mid-term fiscal
adjustment (1.4 percent of GDP) was made in 2011 to keep public debt within 60 percent. For
2012, though revenues were again lower than projected, the Government did not make a midyear fiscal adjustment in anticipation of receipt of privatization revenues. However, a looming
energy shortage (see para. 19) and delays with completing privatization transactions made an
increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2012 unavoidable, pushing the debt level to
60.8 percent. In addition, there are sizable outstanding bills and accumulated arrears for public
works and full VAT reimbursements (approx. E200m per IMF estimates). In December 2012, the
parliament approved the removal of the 60 percent ceiling from the organic budget law, without
proposing any other limit or goal. Albania's 2013 budget targets a general government fiscal
deficit of 3.4 percent and foresees a further increase in public debt.
8.
Clearing arrears to private companies, together with establishing an effective
mechanism for commitment control, is a key priority. The ambitious agenda of public
investments put forward in 2007 was based on anticipation of much higher fiscal revenues than
actually happened after the global financial crisis in 2008. Many public works continued at the
same pace as initially planned despite considerable cuts in the annual budget funding for these
works because of growing fiscal constraints. These works were often carried out through
commercial bank lending. While the unpaid claims could not be identified in the treasury due to
the lack of a multiannual commitment system, the delays in arrears clearance showed up in the
increasing level of Non-performing Loans (NPLs, see para. 11). Swift clearance of arrears is
important for the credibility of public finances, as well as for supporting the private sector at a
difficult time, reducing pressures on the commercial banks, and improving the quality of bank
lending. Recently, government has accelerated the work on setting up the mechanisms that
would prevent recurrence of arrears in the future and publicly committed to clearing existing
arrears in the first half of 2013. Fulfilling this commitment will be a good step forward.
9.
Lowering public debt over the medium-term remains critical to macroeconomic
stability and growth. Albania's public debt is among the highest in Eastern Europe. A high and
growing public debt means increased rollover risks and elevated interest costs. Interest
expenditures are much higher than in other SEE countries, crowding out more productive
spending and representing a major source of vulnerability for the budget. While the deficit has
been mainly used for the development of infrastructure, which has historically suffered from the
lack of investment, financing the deficit is becoming unsustainable. Increased public borrowing
would also damage growth prospects by crowding out the private sector. Additional fiscal
consolidation measures embedded in structural reforms are needed to send a credible signal to
the markets. Priority actions being discussed with the Bank include: (i) strengthening tax
administration and exploring new revenue sources; (ii) reforming power sector rules and tariffs
to make the sector more self-sustaining; and (iii) reforming the pension scheme to stem the
pension fiscal deficit. The use of future privatization revenues, to complete clearance of arrears

3

and reduce debt will be of paramount importance. Albania would also benefit from entering into
a new program with the IMF, after the precautionary program was terminated in 2009.
10.
External imbalances improved in 2012, but remain high. After reaching 15 percent of
GDP in 2009, the Current Account Deficit (CAD) dropped to below 12 percent of GDP in 2010,
owing to an increase in exports, particularly of minerals and electricity. The resumption of large
public investments in 2011 resulted in a spike in imports of machinery and equipment,
contributing to a small deterioration in the trade deficit which was fully financed through foreign
loans. In 2012 CAD dropped to 10.5% of GDP as a result of narrowing trade deficit. The trade
deficit is expected to decline further in the medium-term (to 8 percent by 2014) due to the
moderation of large public investments, which should result in lower imports. The CAD will be
financed by foreign direct investment (banking sector inflows).
11.
The financial sector has remained largely stable vis-d-vis the on-going Eurozone crisis
but faces escalating risks derived from the prolonged unfavorable external environment and
the continued deterioration of banks' loan quality. Albania's banking sector, with assets
equaling about 85 percent of GDP (2011), comprises 16 banks. Five banks collectively hold
about three-quarters of total banking system assets. Four of these banks are Austrian, Greek or
Italian owned. As of September 2012, the overall banking sector capitalization was 15.9 percent
and deposits exceeded pre-crisis levels (having recovered steadily from a sharp drop in 2008).
The banking system is relatively well-provisioned, as the ratio of provisions to total loans has
increased four-fold since 2007. However, this increase in provisions has impacted banks'
financial performance, which is evidenced by declining returns. Furthermore, there has been a
sharp rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), from 6.7 percent in 2008 to 22.7 percent at endSeptember 2012, by now the highest level in the region. This reflects both the general economic
slowdown and the difficulties faced by banks in the execution of their collateral. These
weaknesses are exacerbated by the obstacles some bank borrowers are facing in obtaining VAT
reimbursements and/or payments for goods and services provided to the Government. The tide of
rising NPLs has undermined banks' earnings, capitalization and their ability to extend new loans.
12.
The Bank of Albania (BoA) has been proactive in adopting prudential measures to
safeguard financial stability but continued efforts are needed. Important steps already taken
include requiring banks to seek additional capital, putting in place higher liquidity ratios,
stepping up financial sector monitoring, and finalizing the transformation of bank branches into
subsidiaries. The banking sector has increased its capitalization by over US$200 million in the
last two years. A November 2011 amendment to the Law on Banks strengthened the BoA's
capacity to deal with distressed banks by providing it with the power to establish a bridge bank.
The Ministry of Finance, Financial Supervisory Authority and BoA also established the
Financial Sector Action Group in early 2012 to strengthen macro-prudential supervision across
the financial sector, to enable quick action in the event of a threat to financial stability. While
these actions have helped to maintain financial stability, ongoing Eurozone uncertainty
necessitate continued vigilance and further actions to reduce remaining financial sector
vulnerabilities, stem the tide of increasing NPLs, and encourage banks to resume lending once
private sector demand re-emerges.
13.
The recent sluggish economic performance has likely been insufficient to reduce
poverty. Although Albania experienced rapid poverty reduction up to 2008, the effects of slower
growth appear to be placing a large part of the population under increasing strain. While there
4

has been no official household survey to measure poverty since 2008, available sources such as
the Life in Transition Surveys (LITSs) conducted in 2006 and 2010 indicate that poverty has
stagnated or possibly worsened. This is also supported by Labor Force Survey data on
employment, which shows that 27 percent of Albanian households have at least one member
who had lost a job versus an ECA average of 18 percent. Furthermore, available data on
unemployment indicate a slight increase from 12.5 percent in 2008 to 13.3 percent in 2011.
While the situation of Albanian women has improved over the past decade (particularly with
regard to social services access), gender gaps are pronounced in terms of economic opportunity.
The share of women entering the labor force has increased gradually since the transition but a
large gap in labor force participation is still apparent - with a 56 percent activity rate for women
compared to 77 percent for men. Albania also has a comparatively large wage gap, with women
earning only around 65 percent of men's earnings. See Annex 2 for further information on
gender.
14.
Overall, Albania still faces a number of challenges with respect to the availability and
accuracy of statistics in terms of both macroeconomic monitoring and social welfare
measurement. Annual national accounts data (on expenditure basis) have not been published
since 2007, while quarterly GDP statistics are available only with significant lags. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) is providing TA to develop capacity to complete national
account statistics. As noted above, a comprehensive household survey dataset has not been
published since 2008, complicating the measurement of trends in poverty and household welfare.
The Life in Transition Survey (LITS) program, supported by the Bank, should help to partially
address this gap, but more efforts will be needed - including further analysis of available data to
understand the impact of the slowdown on the most vulnerable groups (e.g., Roma, children and
the elderly). The Bank is increasingly coordinating its assistance in this area with EU-funded
support to raise Albania's capacity to undertake censuses, data processing and analysis, and
dissemination.
III.

Key Development Challenges for the Remainder of the CPS Period

15.
In broad terms, the main challenges facing Albania remain unchanged since the CPS
was prepared but there are some shifts in specific priorities given external and internal
developments. These shifts in priorities are described below to provide context for the changes in
the CPS program described in Sections IV and V below.
Improving Competitiveness
16.
While Albania has made notable achievements in some areas affecting
competitiveness, recent external developments and/or policy inaction have complicated
progress in others. One area in which concrete progress is observable concerns the legal and
regulatory framework for business, which has been substantially overhauled and modernized.
Since 2011, the Government has also stepped up efforts to strengthen property rights, though
deficiencies persist in some key related areas such as construction licensing.
17.
Albania continues its efforts to obtain EU candidate status. In particular, recent
positive steps in terms of governance include the passage of key legislation linked to the EU
accession agenda and the recommendation of EU candidate status, subject to clear conditions.
The past two years also saw some important results with regard to public sector management,
5

including more transparent public procurement and improvements in tax administration. Going
forward, efforts to strengthen public administration, public financial management and the rule of
law must continue. Priority should also be given to the ongoing efforts to fully implement new
financial management and procurement procedures within the central government and
municipalities. Finally, efforts to introduce EU and international accounting standards for the
private sector will also need to be strengthened.
18.
Albania's competitiveness is adversely affected by the fiscal and financial sector issues
discussed in the preceding section. As mentioned in para 9, the high government demand for
credit (to roll-over the large public debt) tends to crowd out the private sector and keep interest
rates at levels above those seen elsewhere in SEE. In turn, weaknesses in fiscal and public
financial management - particularly the non-payment of government contractors and timely
VAT reimbursements - have exacerbated both the rise of NPLs and private sector hardship
during the economic slowdown.
19.
Overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks remains critical to Albania's competitiveness.
The WBG in 2008 supported Albania in a major reform of its power sector. Key elements of this
reform included unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution, and privatization of the
distribution arm (76 percent of shares) to a strategic investor. After initial improvements to the
distribution network, the situation in the sector deteriorated in 2012, leading to the removal by
the regulator of the operating license for the private distributor in early 2013 and appointment of
an interim administrator. Furthermore, Albania and Southeast Europe more broadly suffered a
severe drought through most of 2011-12. This, combined with the dispute with the distribution
company, brought the sector to the verge of crisis, threatening social welfare and economic
growth, undermining investment, and adding pressure on public finances. While favorable
hydrology since December 2012 has helped avert the worst-case scenario for power supply, all
main power sector entities remain exposed to severe financial stress, weather volatility and
uncontrolled energy losses, and the country still faces a constant risk of imminent power
shedding and potential outages. Regarding the dispute between the Government and the majority
shareholder of the distribution company, the two sides are heading towards arbitration, but are
also beginning to engage in informal mediation towards an amicable solution. The World Bank
Group has a long-term commitment to develop Albania's power sector as a key to unlocking
growth.
20.
Addressing this situation in a permanent way will involve, inter-alia: (i) rapid reduction
of power losses, which have increased since 2008; (ii) investments in the grid and in generation
to increase reliability and diversify; (iii) mobilization of funds to inject liquidity and restore
creditworthiness of the public generation company; (iv) restoration, and enforcement, of
commercial contractual practices in the power market and with suppliers; and (v) consistent
Government commitment to implementation of market rules to encourage investment. Another
priority with regard to infrastructure is to strengthen the maintenance, quality and safety of the
road network through institutional reforms to strengthen the nascent roads authority and develop
sustainable road management and financing systems.
Sustaining Social Gains
21.
In light of the potential impact of the economic slowdown on poor households, it is
imperative to ensure that social services and the social protection system alleviate declines in

6

welfare. Despite comparable expenditure patterns, Albania's health and education outcomes
continue to lag behind EU 10 country averages. The key challenge is to improve the efficiency
and quality of services, while continuing to close remaining coverage gaps in rural locations and
for ethnic minorities, such as the Roma. In health, it is critical to strengthen the management of
health care institutions and payments systems to improve the quality and efficiency as well as to
address regional imbalances in the access and quality of service provision. Such efforts need to
be complemented by investments in water and sanitation and waste management to improve not
only population health but also the business environment. In education, it is important to
strengthen school accountability and incentives, reform curricula and improve teacher training.
To foster growth, it is also critical to invest in higher education and skills. Finally, it is of utmost
importance to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Albania's social safety net to avoid the
impoverishing effects of the economic slowdown, including improving the targeting, benefit
design and coherence of the various programs.
Strensthenins Water Resource Management and Adapting to Climate Chanse
22.
Albania's high dependence on its water resources, particularly for hydropower and
irrigation, and the increased incidence of both floods and droughts due to climate change
make it imperative to address water management in a comprehensive and integrated way.
Albania is among the countries in Europe that are most exposed to climate change -- particularly
with respect to damage due to floods and overall water resource management. Climate
variability has magnified serious weaknesses in the management of Albania's water resources,
which is characterized by fragmentation and duplication and inadequate stakeholder
involvement. High priority needs to be accorded to addressing these weaknesses inter alia
through strengthening river basin authorities, developing realistic river basin management plans,
rehabilitating dams and ensuring dam safety while at the same time modernizing irrigation
systems in collaboration with local governments. These efforts should be complemented by
improving watershed and forest management at community level.
IV.

Progress towards achieving CPS objectives and outcomes

23.
The Bank program is delivering important development results in many areas although
efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation and reduce public debt have encountered difficulties in
the face of political pressures and the prolonged Eurozone crisis. While many activities are
still underway, some important results have been achieved to date across all three CPS pillars.
*
In Pillar I - Competitiveness: With regard to the business climate, key achievements
include establishment of an EU-compliant National Metrology Laboratory, adoption of an EUcompliant regulatory framework for inspections, and associated training of 175 government
officials. The inspection legislation has seen major changes with the aim of making the
inspection regime more transparent, efficient and corruption-free. A new central inspectorate was
established and the number of inspectorates has been reduced from 36 to less than 15. The
number of days needed to register a business has been further reduced from 5 to 4 days. Support
to land administration and management, including computerization and capacity building of
major property registration offices, has helped reduce the time to register a property transaction
(now being undertaken within 10 days in Tirana) and improve the quality of services, according
to customer surveys. In public sector management, key outcomes included implementation of an
automated treasury system, tax e-filing, and e-procurement, supported by the Integrated Planning
7

System (IPS) and the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) multi-donor trust funds. The IPS
project has been instrumental to improve analytical capacities for running effectively the
medium-term expenditure framework, and strengthening planning and budgeting processes (see
Box 1). Debt management processes have seen major improvements. Of more than 50 countries
assessed by the World Bank under the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA)
program so far, Albania stands out as one of the few which has sound debt management practices
in the largest number of areas as defined by the DeMPA methodology. Albania jointed the
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), produced two assessment reports and has
asked the International EITI Secretariat to conclude the evaluation exercise, which could result in
Albania being declared EITI compliant during the Global EITI Conference in May 2013.
Following Bank's recommendation to link education with labor market needs, progress has been
made on the adoption of the Bologna process for modular education that is compatible across
Europe, the expansion of the numbers of students in higher education, and the introduction of
short-cycle, sub-degree programs in regional universities. In addition to curriculum reforms,
there has been progress on setting up an accreditation system for universities, and university
ranking procedures. The regional REPARIS program promoted the introduction of EU
requirements and standards in corporate sector accounting, helping over 170 local companies.
IFC's engagement helped to improve corporate governance, and environmental and social
standards at the firm level. Through introduction and implementation of international standards,
IFC helped to increase their sales and exports. Further, an IFC alternative dispute resolution
program contributed to resolving commercial disputes, avoiding lengthy and expensive court
cases and releasing funds for investments. IFC also invested US$6.7 million additional equity in
a state-of-art cement production facility, which, in total, increased local availability of cement at
more competitive prices and provided 400 new jobs. Another area in which outcomes have
largely been met concerns transport bottlenecks. As planned, 110 km of secondary and local road
networks were rehabilitated or constructed, 81 communities are now connected by road to
services and markets, and an asset management system for secondary and local roads is in place.

*

In Pillar II -- Broadening and sustaining Albania's social gains -- some key
achievements include universal retraining of primary health care providers, unification of
primary and secondary health care purchasing, and adoption of performance based contracts in
the funding of public hospitals, as well as adoption of the legislation on mandatory health
insurance. With respect to education, secondary school curricula have been fully revised and
enrollment has risen to over 75 percent (versus a target of 70 percent), triple shifting of
classrooms has been eliminated and double shifting reduced from 36 percent to 16 percent in
basic education and 6 percent in secondary education. Independent assessment of student
achievement is another important innovation. In social protection, significant legal reforms were
implemented to improve targeting of the main programs.

*

In Pillar III -- Improving water, environment and climate risk management -- one
notable result has been improved management of forest, pasture and water resources in about
250 communes, as evidenced by a 28 percent increase in income generated by forest and
agricultural lands, and a significant reduction of soil erosion. Albania also became one of the
first countries to sequester carbon on eroded lands, realizing an emissions reduction payment of
nearly US$200,000 (with an additional payment being processed, following confirmation of
verification of 178,600 tons of Emission Reductions undertaken in September 2012), mainly for
the local communities. Further results have been achieved with respect to remediation of one of
the most contaminated coastal sites in Albania at Porto Romano. In addition, disaster risk

8

management has been strengthened through equipping first responders and piloting a regional
affordable catastrophe risk insurance program. IFC helped foster the private sector role in
renewable energy through supporting a new Renewable Energy Law. Also, IFC financed
US$11.8 million credit line to support a local bank in Albania. The proceeds from the loan will
be utilized to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy projects through eligible sub-loans
to Albanian companies.
24.
The World Bank supported portfolio currently consists of nine operations totaling
US$243.5 million of which 31.2 percent has been disbursed. Eleven operations closed during
FYs10-12, all but one of which were rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory with respect to
achievement of their development objectives. The outcome of one project, the Power Sector
Generation project, was rated moderately unsatisfactory in the ICR due to problems with the
cooling system at the Vlore Power Plant which appeared after project closure. The Bank has
helped to assess the causes of this late-breaking problem, and plans to include support for
upgrading the cooling system within the program going forward (see para. 29). In line with the
operational objective defined in the CPS, closure of these operations led to a significant
consolidation of the portfolio from 18 projects at the end of FY09 to 9 projects by end FY12.
25.
Of the eight projects in the current portfolio, four projects - the Education Excellence
and Equity project, the Land Administration and Management project (LAMP), the Integrated
Coastal Zone Management and Clean-Up project, and Dam Safety Project - are rated moderately
unsatisfactory for implementation progress. For the LAMP, development objective was also
rated moderately unsatisfactory because implementation delays have put at risk the completion
of some key activities. The Government and the Bank have jointly worked on addressing the
implementation issues, and these projects have recently shown improved progress and are
expected to be upgraded in the next months. . During FYsI 1-12, the disbursement ratios (22 and
24 percent respectively) were in line with ECA averages). As of March 2013, IFC's investment
portfolio consists of nine projects totaling US$159 million, of which US$135.6 million is
outstanding.
26.
Trust Funds managed or implemented by the WBG total US$19.1 million and are fully
aligned with Bank activities in support of the CPS pillars (Annex 4). Half of the TF portfolio about US$9.2 million - is in support of Pillar 3 of the CPS, focusing on water and natural
resources management. Nine grants totaling about US$8.7 million are in support of Pillar 1
activities, largely covering the financial sector, infrastructure and land administration. The
governance agenda in particular received substantial support during the CPS period through: (i) a
GPF grant for US$1.5 million aimed at strengthening governance, accountability and public
sector management in a number of areas; and (ii) a US$6 million multi-donor trust fund for an
IPS operation. Both trust funds closed at the end of FY12. A follow up IPS-2 operation has been
prepared, also financed by a multi-donor trust fund, for an initial amount of about US$4 million
dollars, with a further contribution expected in FY14 (Box 1). Additionally, it is expected that
Albania will receive a grant from the new Russia-financed ECA Capacity Development Trust
Fund to prepare a Roads Safety and Maintenance project for delivery at the beginning of the new
CPS period, most likely in July 2014. Finally, for Pillar 2, the CPS program includes US$1.2
million for a community-based youth program financed by a grant from the Japan Social
Development Fund, and the EU is considering support to the work on strengthening social
assistance through IPA13.

9

27.
The Bank Group is using its analytical expertise to engage with the Government, the
private sector and other partners through both formal reports and just-in-time assistance. The
FY11 Country Economic Memorandum focused on priorities for returning to higher economic
growth rates and helped inform the ongoing national debate on the economy. The Bank also
provided analytic and advisory support on debt management (through DeMPA) and carried out
an assessment of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) at the request of the
Ministry of Finance. A major AAA on strengthening governance and anti-corruption efforts was
influential in shaping both Government programs and Bank projects. In addition, the Bank
partnered with UNDP to undertake a joint project on Economic Governance, Regulatory Reform
and Pro-Poor Development. The Bank also provided Aarhus Convention Compliance TA to
improve access to information, public consultations and justice with respect to the environment.
A country specific FY12-14 Corporate Financial Reporting Reform TA project builds on past
REPARIS regional efforts to strengthen corporate sector accounting and financial management
practices in line with EU requirements. In parallel, IFC has been helping to develop a better
corporate governance culture through work with the key regulatory and market institutions and
establishing the Corporate Governance Institute of Albania. IFC's sub-national program helped
assess implementation of streamlining procedures at sub-national level.
Box 1: Governance and Public Sector Management
Governance and public sector management remain important challenges as Albania strives for rapid and
broad-based socio-economic development and convergence with the EU. Given the centrality of
improved governance to Albania's progress towards EU accession, the EC through its annual Progress
Report and accompanying technical and financial assistance has been taking the lead on a wide range of
political and governance criteria. Albania has made notable progress in several priority areas including
electoral reform, anti-corruption actions (such as lifting immunity for high officials, see para 3), judicial
reforms, and strengthening public sector management in areas such as donor coordination, adoption of a
single treasury account and on-going improvements in personnel administration. With the EC in the lead
on governance activities, the WBG and other external partners are playing supportive roles in areas of
their respective expertise. Specifically, the Bank, with EU and bilateral donor financing, has been
involved in strengthening the policy planning and budgeting framework to ensure that core policy and
financial processes function in an integrated manner. Inter alia, the Integrated Planning Systems (IPS) 1
project, which closed in 2012, helped develop an orderly process for budget preparation, development of
a results-based monitoring system, implementation of an automated single treasury system and capacity
development in central and line ministries. An IPS 2 project, also funded by donors, is currently being
prepared to ensure full implementation of reforms introduced under IPS 1. The project will also
strengthen: input cost analysis in public budgets; the quality of M&E in line ministries; capacity for
decentralized management in conformity with EU practices; and, more dynamic macro-fiscal forecasting,
including promoting transparency and improved outreach to all stakeholders. .
V.

Modifications to the CPS and the way forward

28.
The CPS program has been adjusted in some important respects to better help Albania
to manage the risks arising from economic vulnerabilities. As originally designed, the CPS
envisaged total IBRD commitments of US$275 million for FYI 1-14, which was increased to
US$300 million at the end of FY11 to help with catastrophic flooding and safety of major dams.
It retained some flexibility with respect to the pipeline of operations (especially for FY13 andl4)
in view of ongoing Eurozone volatility and the need to calibrate new lending to the pace of
consolidation of the existing portfolio. In light of the continued deterioration in the external
10

environment, growing fiscal constraints, and power sector problems, the Government and Bank
recently agreed to increase the CPS' emphasis on reducing economic, financial sector and energy
sector vulnerabilities. In FY12, the Bank allocated an additional US$275 million to help Albania
respond to the Eurozone crisis, for a total CPS envelope of US$575 million. Incomplete fiscal
consolidation has slowed the pace for absorbing the CPS financing envelope, and efforts in the
second half of the CPS period will focus on structural reforms to create the fiscal space needed
for growth-enhancing investments and targeted support for the economically vulnerable.
29.
The CPS program for FY13 and 14 will include projects under all three Pillars as
described in the following paragraphs (Table 2):
*
Pillar 1 - Competitiveness: To reverse the deteriorating situation in the energy sector
(para. 19), the Government has requested technical and financial support for: i) undertaking, on a
priority basis, a study for optimizing the use of hydro reservoirs along the Drin river cascade and
advising on the tendering process for cooling pipe upgrading works at the Vlore TPP; and ii) to
restoring financial viability and service provision in the sector over the medium-term. While the
first part of the request is being addressed by the on-going program of TA and implementation
support , a new Energy Sector Reform and Recovery Project (US$150 million) will be delivered
in FY14 to help restore financial viability of the sector through: (a) financial restructuring of the
key public energy companies; (b) enforcing application of commercial practices among energy
utilities and consumers, including payment discipline, and (c) targeted investments to increase
efficiency in the power utilities. The Bank and IFC will provide coordinated technical assistance
and advice. Building on its FYI 1-12 investments in re-development of an onshore oilfield in
southern Albania, IFC will continue to be involved in infrastructure through three projects: (i) a
first PPP transaction for the operation and maintenance of the main highway connecting
Albania's coast with Kosovo; (ii) privatization of a series of hydropower plants; and (iii) a PPP
transaction for integrated solid waste management in the Municipality of Tirana. Support to
public sector management and governance will continue through a multi-donor funded IPS2
project, which has been developed in place of the IBRD financed operation proposed under the
original CPS. Given heightened external and internal risks to the financial sector, a new DPL to
strengthen financial sector resilience (US$150m) would be considered for delivery, as soon as
the government demonstrates a clear commitment to a credible program for sustainably tackling
fiscal issues, tentatively in FY14. Provided such commitment, a new series of budget support
operations (US$50-75m per loan) focused on fiscal consolidation and competiveness would
follow the financial sector DPL. Preparation of the roads project, which was planned in the
original CPS program, will begin in FY13, but, provided that all the above operations
materialize, the project will be delivered early under the next CPS to make room under this CPS
for the energy and DPL operations. Should the DPL operations be further postponed, the road
project will be brought forward for FY14 delivery.
*
Pillar 2 - Social Sector: The bulk of IBRD lending under this CPS during FYs 11 and
12 has focused on Pillar 2. The Social Sector Reform DPL (US$25m) was approved in FY11 and
was followed by a results-based investment project for Social Assistance Modernization
(US$50m). The latter project was doubled in size to help Albania address increased household
vulnerability associated with the economic slowdown. A follow-on project is planned in health
for FY14 (US$42m). If both financial and fiscal DPLs go forward in FY14, the health project
11

will be postponed for the next CPS period. An education project will be prepared for the next
CPS, following completion of the ongoing Education Excellence and Equity project.

*
Pillar 3 - Water and Climate Change: The Water Resources and Irrigation Project,
originally planned for FY12, was approved in the second quarter of FY13, and the Water Sector
Investment Project will be delivered later in FY13. Processing of these projects was delayed due
to the challenges in preparing projects involving central and local governments as well as
community organizations. To support the use of clean energy, IFC invested US$8.6 million
equity in a holding company in Albania, which in turn will invest in small hydro projects during
FYs 13-14.

30.
The Bank Group's knowledge work will continue to play a prominent role in support to
Albania. The Bank's AAA program will continue to be demand driven, providing economic and
social analyses, as well as best practice examples and experience from other countries to aid the
authorities in developing policy choices for future reforms. At the request of the Ministry of
Finance, the main support the main focus on AAA in this period will be on supporting fiscal and
financial management. FY13 TA to help the government update its Public Finance management
(PFM) Strategy (FY13) and a FY14 formal report on Public Expenditure and Finance Review
12

will help define means of consolidating and increasing efficiency of spending. In addition, TA
activities for pension reform (FY14) and the energy sector (FY13-14) will focus on increasing
performance and financial sustainability. NPL TA (FY13-14), undertaken with the Bank of
Albania, aims to help reverse an increasing trend in NPLs. In the environment sector, the Bank
will undertake an innovative research activity to value specific environmental services and
develop strategies for payment to communities for the services. Findings will feed directly into
design of the proposed Environmental Services Project (FY14). IFC will continue to use its
advisory services to support Albania to further improve the investment climate in line with the
country's overall EU accession aspirations.

Albania will also benefit from regional AAA work on Regular Economic Reports,
Jobs, Safety Nets, Health Financing, Capacity Building for Monitoring and Evaluation, and
the Regional Energy and Climate Change Strategies, as well as the multi-year efforts on Poverty
Analysis and Gender Monitoring. IFC will also make use of regional programs to support
Albania. The ongoing Balkans Renewable Energy Program will support private sector efforts to
develop and operate feasible energy plants. It will continue to emphasize streamlining of
regulations at the sub-national level and support investment generation and policy advocacy
capability at the national level investment generation and policy advocacy capability at the
national level.
32.
The Bank will work closely with the EU as well as other donors in the delivery of both
lending and AAA activities building on the successful collaboration over the past two years.
Going forward, the Bank will partner closely with the EU, particularly in the social assistance
and public sector management areas. In both these areas, the EU expects to provide IPAl3
financing which will expand and complement ongoing Bank-supported programs. The Bank and
EU also expect to work closely in the areas of property rights and environment in the coming
years. Monthly joint operational meetings have been introduced in order to ensure adequate
coordination. Cooperation will also continue with other multi-lateral partners especially EBRD,
EIB and the UN system. The Bank program also benefits from strong collaboration with a

33.
The adjustments to the CPS program under this Progress Report are reflected in the
revised results matrix attached as Annex 1. Most of the indicators have remained unchanged
because they derive from the ongoing portfolio which has been implementing satisfactorily
during this CPS period. However, some modifications have been introduced to reflect: (i)
introduction of the new financial sector operation and related technical assistance: (ii) the delay
in moving forward with the original DPL program; (iii) delays in processing of the Water
Resources and Irrigation Project and the Water Sector Investment Project; and (iv) the
postponement of the roads project to the next CPS.
VI.

Risks

34.
The CPS faces three main risks: (i)fiscal management and high debt levels; (ii) energy
sector issues; and, (iii)political polarization.
*

Fiscal management and high debt levels: The main risk for the CPS objectives and
program is fiscal management and associated mounting pressures on the public finances. The
problems Government is experiencing in effecting fiscal adjustments have already increased
the debt level beyond the 60 percent benchmark. In addition, there remain sizeable arrears
with respect to VAT reimbursements and payments to contractors for services provided to
the state. A prolongation of the Eurozone crisis would further depress growth prospects in the
medium term, making it difficult for the country to maintain macroeconomic stability,
banking sector resilience and growth without swiftly initiating structural reforms. Lack of
fiscal consolidation and exhausted fiscal space has also delayed the implementation of the
existing portfolio and the planned CPS program. The Bank would support a reform strategy
through continued policy dialogue, a AAA program, and DPL operations.
14

*

Energy sector: The situation in the energy sector, which has dramatically deteriorated over
the past year, presents a major fiscal, financial and supply security risk. The WBG is helping
to mitigate the sector's fragility and vulnerability through: (i) encouraging the government to
find an amicable solution to the dispute with the majority shareholder of the distribution
company through negotiations; (ii) FY13-14 TA to assist with hydropower management and
preparing a long-term sector recovery plan; (iii) a subsequent Energy Reform and Recovery
Project in FY14 to strengthen performance and viability of sector participants in the mediumterm; (iv) a power sector reform pillar in the fiscal DPL series, which are expected to start in
FY14 or early FY15; and (v) Bank's technical assistance coordinated with IFC support to
bring in competitive private sector.

*

Political context: Although the ruling party and the opposition have recently increased
cooperation (para 3) there is a risk that the extreme polarization of 2009-2011 could
reemerge in the run up to and after the June 2013 general elections. This risk is partially
mitigated by the common objective of both parties to achieve EU accession and the position
of the EU that successful conduct of the elections will be key to opening membership
negotiations.

(ii) Improving business regulations and reducing compliance costs for the private sector
The cost of doing business in Albania remains high in part due to administrative corruption and a high "time tax", Albania's investment climate is undermined by inadequate property administration
and weaknesses in urban land administration.

(iii) Improved and more financially sustainable, infrastructure services in roads, energy, and irrigation
Albania's energy sector continues to face technical and financial challenges, in part owing to an unfinished reform agenda. Recent reforms including unbundling of the system, privatization of the
retail supply and investments in strengthening generation and transmission capacities need to be brought to fruition before the impacts can be felt.
Albania's competitiveness is impaired by inadequate road infrastructure. Over 75% of the local network is in poor condition. There has been a significant increase in road investments requiring
commensurate increases in provisions and the efficiency of road maintenance. Efforts to improve road management institutions are underway and need to be consolidate.

Annex 2: Gender Issues in Albania
Dia2nostic
The situation of women in Albania has been improving overall during the past decade. In addition, the
country has made notable progress in raising awareness around the core principles of non-discrimination
and reforming the legal framework to reflect this priority. Nonetheless, evidence from a recently
completed Gender Profile shows that gender concerns persist in several areas, particularly in: (i)
education, particularly access for some population groups; (ii) access to economic opportunities with, for
example, evidence of a gender gap in labor force participation and wages; and (iii) agency, including
issues of domestic violence and women's representation in high level positions and politics. Across all
areas, efforts need to be made for more timely collection and dissemination of data to allow for better
monitoring of gender-related outcomes.
Gender gaps in literacy and education are, on average, low; however, disparities appear for some
population groups and for higher education. Literacy is very high across all parts of the Albanian
population, and universal among young people for both genders. Poor rural girls are less likely to be
enrolled in primary school than any other group, though their enrollment rate is still over 83 percent.
However, both boys and girls, non-poor and poor, see a dramatic drop in enrollment after primary school.
Less than a third of poor Albanian girls are enrolled in secondary school, and even fewer in rural areas.
Poor boys, however, fare even worse: 23 percent of poor boys are enrolled in secondary school (17
percent in rural areas). In the general population, the female secondary school enrollment rate outstrips
the male rate by more than four percentage points. For all groups-poor and non-poor, male and femalesecondary school enrollment is higher in urban areas, though still just above half of the population. The
group with the highest enrollment rate is non-poor urban girls, at 65.7 percent. Girls appear to be at a
learning advantage over boys. The latest PISA findings show that girls outperform boys not only in
reading, but also in math and science, which are often seen as more "male" subjects.
University education has expanded dramatically in recent years, especially among females. Urban
women have the largest absolute gains while rural women have made tremendous relative gains.
Focusing on the urban population between 20-24 years, there is a 20 percentage point gender gap in
higher education attainment in favor of girls. In this time, the share of urban women who have completed
college has doubled to more than half of their population. The share of rural women has gone up by a
factor of ten, though overall their tertiary completion rates remain far behind their urban sisters. Men's
university education has also increased tremendously. Despite the government's push to make university
education available to all Albanians who want it, there are concerns that quality is not keeping pace with
the rapid expansion.
Gender inequalities in health are not particularly pronounced. Nearly all Albanian women receive prenatal care and deliver their babies in a professional health facility, though Albania still has the highest
maternal mortality rate in the Western Balkans countries at 31 per 100,000 births (ECA average is at 34).
Adolescent fertility rates are lower than the regional ECA and OECD averages, at 17 births per 1,000. In
addition, the male mortality rate is significantly lower than its neighboring countries and the ECA and
OECD averages. This is reflected in one of the highest male life expectancies in the region (74 years),
significantly higher than the regional average of 66 years. Life expectancy for women is also high at 80
years (75 for ECA). New health challenges are however emerging for Albania, with the adult population
facing a "double burden" of developing and developed world diseases (e.g., infectious diseases such as
HIV, as well as problems of obesity and diabetes).
Maternal mortality stands out as a big outlier in Albania (21 per 100,000 live births) as opposed to other
countries in the region. The share of births attended by health personnel and antenatal care are at the
23

ECA average, according to DHS still there are differences especially in rural and remote areas where
antenatal care starts later and it is not as frequent as needed, and there is inadequate emergency response
and rapid referral.
Another dimension in which Albania appears to stand out against the rest of the region is fertility.
Adolescent fertility rates (14.25) are lower than ECA and the rest of the Western Balkans. But while
education levels are rising among young women, the adolescent fertility rate is also slowly rising, with
one quarter of a percentage point higher than in 2002.
Some of the main gender inequalities in Albania are in labor markets. Even though a greater share of
women entered the labor force since transition, there is still a large gender gap in labor force participation,
with a 56 percent activity rate for women, compared to 77 for men (2009). Among women of working age
who are inactive, more than one in three report that this is due to domestic work. The share of inactive
women who are housewives has decreased since 2005 while the share of women students has increased.
For unemployment, the overall gender disparity is small. Albania has a large wage gap (raw) compared to
other countries in the region, with women earning around $0.65 for every $1 men earn. Although women
work slightly fewer hours per week than men, many also continue to bear the full burden of household
duties.
While the female share in the total labor force is comparable to the regional one,with the female
participation rate at about 56 percent. Women constitute 43 percent of the economical active population.
Female employment is more concentrated in agriculture than in other countries perhaps due to the
importance of this sector in the economy. The limited coverage of preschool services (only 40 percent of
children attend kindergarten) and of other gender friendly services to explain the low levels of labor
market participation.
Women not only are less likely to be engaged in market activities, they also are less likely to be in the
sectors which before the crisis experienced vigorous employment growth, such as construction. Data
show that during the decade to 2006 female trend stagnated, while male employment increased. Firm
level surveys confirm this picture, with only 37 percent of women as full time workers, and with only 9
percent of full time non-production workers being women. While this is in line with the regional
performance, only 11 percent of firms in 2007 had women participating in their ownership, against an
ECA average more than 3 times as high.
Registration of immovable property in Albania is done by the male spouse, or head of household in the
case of the farming family, who register the property in their own name. Also, the registration for
legalization of illegal/informal constructions of matrimonial homes is done at the name of the household.
These practices can lead to discrimination against women in access to these properties. For example, there
have been problems in the area of applications for credits and alienation of property, when these are done
by one of the spouses in both spouses' names, but without even letting the other spouse know or seeking
their consent.
Important gender gaps remain in agency and domestic violence continues to be a serious issue. Women's
roles in public life remain circumscribed by traditional gender norms which limit their decision-making
power in local and national politics, though important breakthroughs at the national level took place
recently. The share of women parliamentarians and ministers, however, remains relatively low (16 and 7
percent respectively). Women's representation in high positions in firms is also low; only 11 percent of
firms have females in their ownership structures and 20 percent of firms have females in top management
positions. At the household, evidence suggests that most women have some voice within their household
on how their own earnings are spent. On the other hand, violence against women continues to be a serious

24

issue. One out of every three women has been physically abused and 13 percent are survivors of sexual
abuse. 51 percent and 39 percent of women have suffered emotional and psychological abuse,
respectively. In addition, there are still challenges to overcome in women's property rights, where there
are still issues in land titling that put women at a disadvantage.
Albania's Family Code generally provides a favorable level of protection to Albanian women. However,
challenges remain especially in the private sphere for women to have a productive life. According to a
survey run by the Statistical Office (UNICEF-INSTAT 2009) 31 percent of women experienced physical
violence, and 13 percent sexual violence in their marriage or relationship, with psychological and
emotional abuse even more widespread. In the period 2003-2009 tangible improvements have occurred in
the Albanian legislation and the measures taken concerning the prevention and reduction of domestic
violence. Among the most important measures were the Law "On Measures against Violence in Family
Relations" and the accompanying measures for its implementation and, the adoption of two new laws,
"On Gender Equality in Society" and "On Protection from Discrimination". However, indication are that
enforcement of the law remains weak.
Important measures have been taken to facilitate the reporting of violence and to create new specialized
structures for the protection of women from domestic violence such at the Police Directorate in the
Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Labor. In the courts there are judges who specialize in family
law and the examination of petitions for protection orders. However, Ministry of Justice must ensure
offering of free legal assistance for the victims as provided by the law. Further training and monitoring of
the activity of bailiff s offices with regard to the enforcement of protection orders is needed.
Women's roles in public life remain circumscribed by traditional gender norms which limit their decisionmaking power in local and national politics, though important changes took place in 2009. In the run-up
to the 2009 parliamentary elections, Albania adopted a quota calling for 30 percent of all candidates on
party lists to be women. While the target for representation in political positions has not been reached, the
legislation nevertheless had an impressive impact, helping to sweep 23 women into the 140-MP
Parliament, bringing the share of seats held by women to nearly 16 percent, up from 7 MPs in the
previous election cycle. Also, more women voted in the last elections and participated in electoral
commissions than in previous years (UN MDGs report). At the local level, women's representation has
been very low. Less than three percent of those nominated for mayor in 2007 were women. Of the 33
women nominated, only nine won. At the national level, there is currently only one woman in the
Cabinet of Ministers, though women now make up 22 percent of the deputy ministers. In the lower-level
governmental jobs, women are much better represented, making up almost 57 percent specialists in the
public administration of line ministries, and 32 percent of directors (UN MDGs report).
Gender in the Bank Pro2ram
The Albania portfolio includes examples of successful gender mainstreaming in several operations, but
continued efforts to strengthen the inclusion of gender considerations in both ongoing and new projects
are needed. During FYs 13 -14, the "Gender in the Western Balkans" AAA initiative will support gender
mainstreaming into the Albania portfolio with a specific focus on increasing monitoring and evaluation of
gender-aware interventions. Some examples of gender mainstreaming are:
* The Land Administration and Management Project (LAMP), which addresses gender-biases in land
ownership - from legal frameworks to registration practices. Specific project actions to reduce gender
inequalities in land rights include: (a) public awareness/information campaigns; (b) gender-sensitivity
training of central and municipal office workers; and (c) encouragement of joint titling during
registration.
* The Secondary and Local Roads project created spaces for women's participation at the community
level. Women are represented in communal authorities and have been part of project consultations such as

25

safety improvements, and design improvements -- translating into better physical access to health,
education and administrative centers for rural women.
* The Health System Modernization project supported maternal health by increasing access to antenatal
services and setting quantitative targets to measure progress. It improved early detection of breast cancer
through introducing screening at the primary care level and provision of mammography equipment at four
hospitals.
* The Social Assistance Modernization Project, which focuses on improving the targeting and
efficiency of Albania's main social assistance programs, should also contribute to narrowing gender gaps
in living standards given that women are slightly overrepresented among the poor.
* In some cases, gender-informed work is taking place outside the lending portfolio. A particularly
noteworthy example is the JSDF grant for Youth Empowerment which is enhancing young people's
access to opportunities in education and employment, with a major focus on young women. Lessons from
this type of intervention can inform future programs and lending operations.
Four investment projects included in the FY13-14 program are expected to focus on gender. Preparation
of the two water projects (WRIP and WSIP) is already well advanced and both included early
consultations with gender specialists to ensure sensitivity to gender concerns. For example, the WRIP will
pay special attention to the needs of the over 5,00 women farmers living in the project area through
targeted social mobilization activities. All relevant indicators will be disaggregated by gender with special
attention paid to participation of women in public consultation processes and in water user organizations.
The two FY14 investment projects (environment services and health services respectively) are still at a
very early stage of development but will involve careful attention to gender concerns in the projects'
design and ensure that women participate in, and benefit fully, from the projects' components.

26

Annex 3: The World Bank Group and Other External Donors
The WBG continues to be among the biggest donors in Albania with an average of US$36 million per
year in terms of disbursements. Moreover the Bank Group has continued to play the role of a catalyst in
helping the Government coordinate donor assistance and mobilize financing for key sector programs, with
considerable success. The current portfolio of 8 projects totals US$218.5 million in IDA credits and
IBRD loans and is co-financed with other partners for an the amount of US$112.1 million - implying a
ratio of US$0.5 in co-financing for each dollar of Bank financing.
Notably, in the transport sector, the Secondary and Local Roads Project (IDA US$20m) has benefitted
from the partnership of several international and European financing institutions, mobilizing parallel
financing of around US$430 million. The Education Excellence and Equity project, designed as a sectorwide operation, is supporting a broad based sectoral reform with parallel financing from EIB and CEDB.
The regional Energy Community of South East Europe project and the Dam Safety project are cofinanced by SECO, EBRD and KfW. In public sector management, the Bank successfully managed a First
Multi-Donor Trust Fund of US$6 million which included financial contributions from seven donors. IFC
has also been successful in mobilizing support from a wide range of development partners for its advisory
services and technical assistance. With Government's support in promoting donor coordination, the
World Bank program in Albania is enhanced by several co-financing trust funds - both stand alone grants
and grants linked directly to projects. Some examples include, the second multi-donor TF for the
Integrated Planning System (IPS-2), currently planned to be financed by multiple donors at a level of
about US$4 million; a Multi-Donor Trust Fund of US$ 1.8 million under the REPARIS program to
improve financial reporting; the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant of US$1.1 million for
youth empowerment; an IDF grant of US$370,000 to implement the Aarhus Convention agreements; a
grant of US$ 1.1 million from the GFDRR for flood risk mitigation; a Swedish TF for Improved Natural
Resource Management of about US$ 2.8 million, and a US$ 740,000 fee-based-service from UNDP on
public utility governance in water and electricity.
In line with the objectives set forth at the beginning of the CPS, the Bank and IFC have intensified the
dialogue and collaboration with the EU in support of Albania's European integration process and in
mobilizing co-financing for the forthcoming operations. As a result, EU is committed to co-finance the
TA component under the Social Assistance Modernization Project at the amount of Euro 1,5 million. The
Bank and EC also expect to work closely in the areas of property rights and environment in the coming
years. Cooperation will also continue with other multi-lateral partners especially EBRD, EIB and the UN
system. Joint operational meetings on monthly basis have already been initiated. The Bank program also
benefits from substantial support from a number of other bilateral partners including Austria, Japan,
Germany (KfW), Sweden and Switzerland. Close cooperation with these partners will continue through
Government-led platforms as well as on a bilateral basis.
