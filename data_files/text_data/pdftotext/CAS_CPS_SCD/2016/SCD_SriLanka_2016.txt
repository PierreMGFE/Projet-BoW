The Systematic Country Diagnostic:
A New World Bank Group Tool for
Country Engagement
Under its new approach to working with its country
partners, the World Bank Group (WBG) requires the
preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)
to precede the development of Country Partnership
Frameworks that guide programming. The objective of
an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints and
opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress
toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.
The SCD is expected to produce an objective, evidencebased, candid assessment of the main challenges facing
the country, without limitation to the areas where the
WBG is currently engaged.

I. Executive Summary

1.
Sri Lanka is in many respects a development success story. With economic growth averaging more than 7
percent a year over the past five years on top of an average growth of 6 percent the preceding five years, Sri Lanka
has made notable strides towards the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity (the “twin
goals”). The national poverty headcount rate declined
from 22.7 to 6.7 percent between 2002 and 2012/13, while
consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent grew at
3.3 percent a year, compared to 2.8 percent for the total
population. Other human development indicators are also
impressive by regional and lower middle-income country
standards. Sri Lanka has also succeeded in ending decades
of internal conflict in 2009 and steps have been taken towards reconciliation.
2.
Increases in labor incomes account for most of
the reduction in poverty over the last 10 years. Between 2002 and 2012/13, most of the reduction in poverty was due to increased earnings, as opposed to higher
employment or higher transfers. Although it is hard to be
certain, increases in earnings are associated with: (i) a slow
structural transformation away from agriculture and into
industry and services that led to productivity increases; (ii)
agglomeration around key urban areas that supported this
structural transformation; (iii) domestic-driven growth, including public-sector investment that led to increases in
labor demand, particularly in industry and services; and
(iv) a commodity boom that led to higher labor earnings
for agricultural workers in the context of lower agricultural
employment.
3.
However, important challenges lie ahead that
may hinder further progress on poverty reduction and
shared prosperity. Despite the low levels of extreme poverty, roughly one quarter of Sri Lankans are nearly poor, as
defined by living above the official poverty line (equivalent to about $1.50 per day in 2005 purchasing power parity, PPP, terms) but below $2.50 per day in 2005 PPP terms.
The living standards of the near poor are closer to those of
the poor than those living above $2.50 per day. Moreover,
Sri Lanka’s aspirations as a middle-income country (MIC)
will differ from those of a successfully developing low-income country emerging out of conflict. Although Sri Lanka has excelled in overcoming human development challenges typical of a low-income country, its service delivery
systems in education, health, and other areas must now
adjust to face new and changing demands typical of a MIC.
Imperatives to improve social protection programs will increase owing to an aging population that has passed its
demographic peak. Finally, given increasing affluence and
information, there will be higher expectations of the state
to perform in order to facilitate growth, provide higher level of services, and demonstrate increasing responsiveness
to a more demanding citizenry.

4.
The country is at an important economic and political crossroads as it faces these challenges. Sri Lanka’s
real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 43 percent from
2009 to 2014, with the top four sectors (accounting for half
of total growth) being all non-tradable sectors: construction, transport, domestic trade and banking, insurance and
real estate. A substantial portion of this growth was driven
by public investment to rebuild after the end of its 30Poverty dropped by
year internal conflict in 2009.
These sectors, as well as the over two-thirds from
economic boost at the end 2002 to 2012/13
of the conflict, are not likely
to be sustainable sources of
growth in the long run. In addition to the need to foster
new sources of growth, Sri Lanka is in the process of major
governance reforms following the election of a new government in early 2015. The Constitution has been amended to overhaul the structure of government by reducing
the power of the presidency and providing for more internal checks and accountability mechanisms. There is also
now a constitutional guarantee of citizens’ right to information. At the same time, while reforms to promote transparency and accountability in government should lead to
better performance, a political settlement around the new
governance structure will need to emerge.

issues identified in each of the 22 areas and identify knowledge gaps. These findings were weighted against criteria of: (i) the potential impact on ending poverty and on
promoting shared prosperity; (ii) the degree to which addressing these constraints would have complementarities
across different domains; (iii) the strength of the evidence
base behind the impact; (iv) the time horizon of impacts;
and (v) whether addressing the constraint is a precondition to unlocking wider potential. This process yielded
consensus that the key priorities for sustaining progress
in ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity are to
address the country’s fiscal, competitiveness and inclusion
challenges, as well as cross-cutting governance and sustainability challenges.

The Fiscal Challenge
6.
Low and declining revenues critically impact
Sri Lanka’s fiscal position. Sri Lanka now has one of the
lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios in the world, reflecting a
decline from 24.2 percent in 1978 to 10.7 percent in 2014.
The major causes of this decline are the low increase in the
number of taxpayers, reductions in statutory rates without commensurate efforts
Sri Lanka has one to expand the tax base, inefficiencies in administration
of the lowest tax and numerous exemptions.
revenue-to-GDP ratios In particular, since the inof a value added
in the world troduction
tax (VAT) in 2002, successive
changes in the tax regime
have led to over 500 types of exemptions for a wide variety
of goods. There are also over 40 broad types of exemptions
on corporate and personal income tax depending on the
source of income and the type of taxpayer. Administration
is complicated by lack of coordination among entities collecting revenue as well as the Board of Investment, which
provides incentives. No tax expenditure analysis is conducted before or after the introduction of incentives.
7.
Low tax revenues combined with an expenditure
profile that is largely non-discretionary has led to a
lean, rigid budget with little room for critical development spending. Sri Lanka’s overall revenues and expenditures are among the lowest in the region as a percentage
of GDP. Fiscal consolidation and relative prioritization of
public investment in capital infrastructure following the
conflict have squeezed spending on other public goods,
including health, education and social protection, which
are currently below levels in other regional and emerging
market comparators. Fiscal consolidation combined with
declining revenues has made the budget rigid, leaving
little fiscal space for the government to maneuver. Difficult-to-reduce items, such as public service remuneration,

12

|

I. Executive Summary

transfers, and interest payments, have accounted for 60
percent of expenditure in recent years. Moreover, wage
pressures have been rising due to a 57 percent increase
in the number of public servants in the past 10 years. This
has yielded a situation where public servants account for
13 percent of the labor force, comparable to the OECD average of 15 percent in 2011. At the same time, increases
in recurrent expenditures in early 2015, particularly a raise
in allowances to public servants, is to be financed by onetime taxes, leaving very little room to maneuver. A strong
commitment to fiscal consolidation in the face of these
pressures has led to Sri Lanka having extremely low levels
of public spending on education, health, and social protection as a percentage of GDP. Going forward, continued
commitment to fiscal consolidation is critical to ensure
macroeconomic stability, but this will require long-term
improvements in revenues.

The Challenge of Promoting More
and Better Jobs for the Bottom 40
Percent
8.
Sri Lanka has a number of advantages that can
contribute to inclusive growth. Given its relatively small
domestic market, Sri Lanka will need to look outward to
fulfill its ambitions to become a prosperous and competitive middle-income country. As such, the country has important strengths, such as overall strong human capital
and a reliable infrastructure base, particularly when compared to other South Asian countries. Sri Lanka also enjoys
an enviable location in a fast-growing region along a major
trade route, opening opportunities to serve as a regional

climate, diverse topography,
and unique historical assets,
giving it a strong basis for tourism. At the same time, the
country has a track record of developing globally competitive companies, particularly in niches of the apparel and
information technology (IT) sectors.
9.
To capitalize on its advantages Sri Lanka will
need to find an effective balance along two axes: (i) inward vs. outward orientation of the economy; and (ii)
the respective roles of the public and private sectors
(Figure 1.1). The country’s world market share has fallen to
levels last seen in the 1980s, with a steady decline in commodity exports and an export basket that has remained
largely unchanged in a context of rising production costs
and weakening demand due to slow growth in some of its
main markets (Europe and the Middle East). At the same

model, as public investment to rebuild following the end
of conflict was responsible for much of the large growth in
construction as well as transport over the last decade.

of protection on final products than on inputs
used in their production lead to an anti-export
bias, since producers have strong incentive to
sell goods domestically even though their domestic costs are higher than their opportunity
costs through trade. This is particularly worrying for the agricultural sector, where high protection of import-competing crops along with
fertilizer subsidies have created strong disincentives for crop and export diversification.
Incentives are structured to expand production of import-competing crops (rice, maize)
and discourage the production of exportables
through the introduction of high export taxes
(‘cesses’) on raw materials such as tea, rubber,
cinnamon, coconut and spices, with the notion that this would increase value addition of
exports. Revenues from cesses were supposed
to be then invested in research and development for the corresponding sectors to encourage value addition, yet this has not been implemented.

11. Foreign direct investment, a foundation for economic diversification, has been disappointing despite numerous fiscal incentives. FDI remains below 2 percent of GDP five years after the end of
armed conflict, which is low relative to much higher levels
of FDI in other MICs such as Vietnam or Cambodia. While
FDI can enhance access of producers to global production
networks and facilitate the development of new activities within existing value chains, FDI inflows to Sri Lanka
have been largely focused on infrastructure (inclusive of
real estate development), with a relatively small proportion reaching sectors of the economy that are associated
with global networks of production. Although conclusive
data is not available, the benefits from incentives in terms
of attraction and retention of productivity-enhancing FDI
may not outweigh the costs involved in fiscal losses and
potential disruption of market dynamics (through, among
other things, the creation of an unleveled playing field).
Global experience suggests that the most important ways
to ensure both domestic and foreign investment include
measures to improve the enabling environment, including
through a skilled workforce and adequate innovation policies that form the basis of a competitive economy.
12. Despite past achievements, the quality of general education lags behind higher middle-income countries and firms have difficulty accessing the skills they
need. Although human development indicators are ahead
of regional peers, the quality of education, as measured
by periodic internationally comparable tests, lags behind that of higher middle-income countries, particularly
in language and numeracy skills. Sri Lanka also lacks the

are increasingly in demand, reflecting constraints on the
quality and relevance of higher education and research.

agriculture where there is limited distribution of new technologies critical for modern farming.

The Relationship between the Public Sector and
Private Sector
13. The government’s performance as regulator and
facilitator of economic activity has improved in recent
years, though significant shortcomings remain. Given
fiscal constraints, sustained growth will need to be driven
by the private sector, which, in turn, calls for government
regulation conducive to business. Among areas of regulation, systems for registration of property rights and landuse regimes that introduce limitations and lead to fragmentation of land parcels

Moreover, the predictability
of state regulation with regard to property rights has proven to be an issue, with particular harm caused by the “Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized
Assets Act”, which expropriated 37 enterprises in sectors
like hotels, mixed-property development and the sugar
industry. Licenses and permits are also an obstacle, particularly in the Northern Province. Finally, policy-induced barriers consisting of regulatory and institutional bottlenecks
account for nearly 70 percent of the total time spent on
exporting or importing goods.
14. Similarly, labor market regulations appear to
be constraining the growth of employment. Although
labor market regulations aim to provide job security to
formal sector workers, since these represent only about 15
percent of the workforce, they have resulted in creating a
deep divide between formal and informal workers. Sri Lanka’s Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA)

14

|

I. Executive Summary

requires that firms with 15 or more employees justify
layoffs and provide generous severance pay to displaced
workers, with smaller firms being exempted. These severance payments are expensive relative to regional and middle-income peers. Finally, the legal framework prevents
women from taking up night work or part-time work in the
growing service sector while the laws governing maternity
benefits make employers bear the entire cost, potentially
deterring employers from hiring women.

es and market inefficiencies.
Unfair competition from informal players is viewed as the single most important obstacle to the growth and competitiveness of established
firms. At the same time, informal firms generally have no
access to financial services, government contracts, and essential licenses and permits.
16. Although successive policy regimes have introduced numerous programs aimed at supporting the
small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, firms
in this sector face multiple constraints, particularly
access to finance and technology. Financing issues are
driven by weaknesses of the firms to put forward bankable
projects as well as failures in SME banking which relies on
asset-based financing with little flexibility to provide project-based finance. SMEs also find it difficult to access technology to upgrade their businesses. Reducing the cost of
operating a business along with stronger enforcement can
help to reduce informality, reduce uncompetitive practices, and, by extension, create an environment more conducive to investment in productivity-enhancing activities.
17. The proliferation of small firms and informal employment has important consequences for the ability
of the bottom 40 percent to share in the growth process. Most of the increase in non-agricultural employment
between 2002 and 2012 was in self-employed non-farm
workers. Moreover, the decline in agricultural employment
coincided with an increase in workers employed in establishments with no regular employees. By 2012, 74 percent
of unskilled workers (those with less than a primary education) had only temporary or casual wage employment, up

from 70 percent in 2006, suggesting that these workers are
increasingly working under precarious conditions. Wages
of temporary workers are on average 33 percent lower
than wages of permanent workers; one-third of which
cannot be explained by differences in the job or individual characteristics, suggesting that workers would choose
more stable reliable jobs if they could.
Beyond carrying out regulatory functions, the
state itself is a major parin the market

dynamics SOEs have a significant market share in many sectors,
including areas where there is not a strong apparent rationale for public intervention. This is most striking in the
finance sector, where major SOEs make up close to half of
the market. At the same time, there is a weak framework
for public-private partnerships and relatively few cases of
PPPs; infrastructure development over the past 10 years
has been driven by direct public spending. Finally, the
state plays an outsized role as an employer. There is strong
demand for public-sector jobs as public-sector workers
enjoy the advantages of formal employment and other
benefits such as a pension. Moreover, the evidence suggests that there is a salary premium for public-sector workers and that this premium has grown between 2006 and
2012. Workers, particularly educated women, are queuing
for public-sector employment.

18.

19. Finally, there has been a high degree of interconnectedness between the state and some segments of
the private sector that motivates intervention by the
government. The variation in tax and customs incentives reflects government policy but also contains specific
benefits for specific sectors, many of which have a limited number of major actors. In addition, there are several
high-profile cases of movement of senior officials between
public and private sectors as there is no developed framework for handling conflicts of interest to separate public-sector work from private-sector interests. Given that
there are frequent instances of state regulatory help to a
given sector it follows that private-sector entities would
seek to maintain or expand privileges, reinforcing the level of regulatory intervention into the economy. These circumstances also suggest that many private-sector entities
would have to adjust considerably were Sri Lanka to open
its markets to a greater extent. Changing the state’s role
as an employer, market actor and regulator to provide for

a more level playing field will encounter resistance from
vested interests.

Social Inclusion Challenges
20. The highest numbers of people living in poverty
and the bottom 40 percent are located within multicity agglomeration areas. At the same time, urbanization in Sri Lanka has been a strong driver of growth and
that trend will continue. Streamlining urban management
structures and improving
their capacity to ensure Urbanization can

with the opportunity to respond to both present and future needs. Improved connectivity across the country will
further assist in raising the economic potential located
outside the Kandy-Colombo-Galle agglomeration, as well
as improving growth drivers within those districts. Further
analysis on the constraints to participation of the bottom 40 percent in further agglomeration and spreading
economic activity will be important for assessing what is
needed to have urbanization facilitate inclusion.
21. The poor in more isolated regions of the country
represent a different challenge. There are high rates of
poverty in the Northern and
Eastern Provinces, the center where the estate sector There are high
(plantation-based agriculture) is concentrated, and rates of poverty in
Moneragala in the south- the Northern and
east. Poverty rates are highEastern Provinces,
est in portions of the Northern and Eastern provinces, the estate sector, and
which were most affected Moneragala
by the internal conflict. The
high poverty headcount rates in these regions are associated with weak links to the labor market, particularly
among the youth and educated women. People with physical disabilities and psychological problems due to conflict,
in particular ex-combatants and widows, are particularly
vulnerable to exclusion.
22. Poverty measured by consumption has dropped
significantly among estate workers, but non-monetary
measures of poverty and vulnerability remain high.
Estate workers continue to be largely dependent on the
estate’s management for many basic needs, particularly
housing. While poverty in the estate sector fell markedly in
the past decade, poverty rates continue to be higher com-

pared to both urban and rural sectors, pointing to continued vulnerability. This is particularly evident when looking
at health and nutrition indicators. Estates have the highest
maternal mortality rates in the country, and both estate
women as well as children suffer from high rates of malnutrition that are double national averages. Estate-sector
households are less likely to have drinking water, sanitary
facilities or electricity within their households. Moreover,
access to services and the quality of services in the estates
is comparatively low. Poor outcomes in education impede
the ability of the estate population to participate in Sri
Lankan society. The youth are increasingly leaving the estate sector but they face difficulties in accessing salaried
employment when competing with other youth. Women
tend to be employed for the lowest-paying unskilled tasks
that require intense labor, such as tea plucking or rubber
tapping. Despite being income earners, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that the wages of estate women
are often collected by their husbands or fathers who often
spend it on alcohol. Alcoholism and associated abuse of
women is much higher in the estate sector.
23. The estate sector faces structural challenges that
will likely impact the population going forward. Wages
have risen by over 10 times since privatization in 1992 –
due in part to the strong collective bargaining power of
estate workers, linked to a powerful political party representing them. At the same time, Sri Lankan tea producers
are facing increasing competition from Kenyan and Indian
producers who have lower costs of production and higher
productivity. As a result, the future welfare of estate communities is at risk due to narrowing surpluses enjoyed by
Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) and a socio-economic structure that may not be tenable over the long
term.
24. Beyond the locational concentration of the population, inclusion across ethnic and religious groups is
critical. Although partially correlated to spatial disparities,
poverty outcomes across ethnicity and religion illustrate a
second important challenge for social inclusion. Differences in poverty outcomes across ethnic groups are related
to employment and other opportunities. This is the case
even when the North and East are excluded from comparisons. As more youth migrate across the country in search
of jobs, equal opportunities will be critical. Sri Lankan
Tamils and Sri Lankan Moors have relatively high levels of
poverty, as detailed in Chapter V; however, empirical analysis finds that most of the difference in monetary poverty is related to inequality of opportunities. For a range of
indicators, the most recent household survey shows that
Sri Lankan Tamil households have lower access to basic
services, including drinking water within their premises,

toilet within their unit and access to electricity. Similarly,
educational attainment is lower for the ethnic minority
workforce, and rates of ownership of land are also uneven
among the country’s ethnic communities. In terms of labor
market opportunities, labor force participation is low and
unemployment is high for Sri Lankan Tamils and Moors.
However, when focusing outside of the post-conflict regions, both Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils have higher labor
force participation and employment rates relative to their
Sinhalese counterparts. This suggests that different rates
of participation are mostly determined by differences in
employment opportunities. The conflict-affected areas
face the additional challenge of integrating displaced persons: while over 700,000 have returned, they face multiple
challenges in securing land rights, accessing shelter and
infrastructure, and developing livelihoods.
25. Finally, gender inclusion is critical, particularly
as it relates to the labor market. Women made up 53
percent of the working age population in 2012, but only
34 percent of the employed population, a figure that has
remained static for decades. Women are less likely to participate in the labor market, but when they decideto look
for work, they are more likely to be unemployed. Social

nity to participate in the labor market. However, beyond social norms, gender wage
gaps and occupational segregation dissuade and constrain women from participating in the labor force. At the
same time, the formal legal framework for labor prevents
women from taking up night work or part-time work in the
growing service sector, and the laws governing maternity
benefits make employers bear the entire cost, potentially
deterring employers from hiring women.

The Cross-Cutting Governance
Challenge
26. The governance challenge manifests itself in
many ways which taken together constitute the fundamental constraint on progress on the twin goals.
Governance issues are cross cutting and underlie in many
important ways the three challenges outlined above. Governance is obviously central to the quality and probity of
public expenditure as well as the government’s capacity
to provide for equality of opportunity for the poor and
bottom 40 percent to improve their welfare. Moreover, the
quality of governance is integral to addressing corruption

concerns and sustaining public trust. It is also integral to
revenue performance, particularly the effectiveness of tax
and customs administration. The most prominent manner
in which governance acts as a constraint is in how the state
carries out regulatory functions for the economy. Policies
that orient the economy inward, such as the convoluted
tax system, restrictive land and labor market regulation,
and inefficient subsidies – and the related quality of administration thereof – reflect areas where governance is a
critical constraint. This burden of government regulation
has led to a large informal sector, which negatively impacts
improvements in productivity. Governance weaknesses
have further led to significant expansion of the public sector’s role in the labor market and certain economic sectors.
This expanded role in the economy contributes little to effective use of the country’s resources or productivity gains,
whether it is interventions in agriculture, multiplying tax
incentives, or absorbing a significant portion of the labor
force. Finally, ensuring the provision of key public goods
such as infrastructure and public services is a core function
of government; the extent to which there is inequality in
access to such goods reflects areas where strengthened
governance is warranted.

Sustainability Challenges
27. Sustainability of Sri Lanka’s development will involve keeping momentum towards reconciliation and
successful completion of institutional reforms. Achieving a lasting settlement of conflict that ensures peace and
security for Sri Lankans is the sine qua non condition for
progress. While circumstances are unique to every country
and conflict is not minent,
experience suggests

ensures peace Achieving reconciliation and
addressing issues that led to
and security for Sri grievances that, in turn, fuLankans is a sine qua eled conflict in the past will
be critical. Sri Lanka has taknon condition for en
notable steps along this
progress path, including following
up on extensive recommendations by its Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learned
and Reconciliation (LLRC). Important measures have occurred in recent months, including the appointment of a
civilian as governor in the north and beginning to return
some land occupied by the military after the conflict ended. This momentum will need to be sustained. Sri Lanka
will also need to follow through on major institutional reforms now taking place to achieve a lasting political settlement around a government that is more transparent and
accountable.

28. Other risks to sustainability are associated with
economic stability in the context of an uncertain external environment and environmental issues. External
risks include a chronic current account deficit and relatively low reserve adequacy metrics; a gradual but steady
decline in goods exports; an already high external debt
burden and a rising cost for external financing as Sri Lanka
must now borrow on commercial terms; and disappointing
levels of foreign direct investment. While the current account deficit has decreased in recent years, in part thanks
to slow increases in remittances and tourism, it remains financed largely by debt-creating inflows. At the same time,
Central Bank foreign exchange reserves are at the lower
end of what is considered adequate by standard metrics.
Moreover, Sri Lanka is in the
midst of its demographic
transition, and is projected Sri Lanka is projected
to age fast in the next few to age fast in the next
decades. As the elderly typfew decades
ically run down their savings and require additional
public spending in the form of pensions, social protection
and healthcare, their increasing share in the population
means that national savings will fall even further. Finally,
preserving Sri Lanka’s natural asset base and managing environmental impact as the country continues its structural
transformation, including urbanization, will be critical to
sustaining progress on the twin goals. Sri Lanka will continue to face environmental risks due to natural disasters
as well as the long-term impacts of climate change, which
by one accounting will result in reductions of 1.2 percent
of GDP per year by 2050.

Conclusions
29. Sri Lanka’s has had impressive development
gains but there are strong indications that drivers
of past progress are not sustainable. Solid economic
growth, strong poverty reduction, overcoming internal
conflict, effecting a remarkable democratic transition in
recent months, and overall strong human development
outcomes are a track record that would make any country proud. However, the country’s inward looking growth
model based on non-tradable sectors and domestic demand amplified by public investment cannot be expected
to lead to sustained inclusive growth going forward.
30. A systematic diagnostic points to fiscal, competitiveness, and inclusion challenges as well as cross-cutting governance and sustainability challenges as priority areas of focus for sustaining progress in ending
poverty and promoting shared prosperity (Table 1.1).
The fiscal challenge is due above all to poor revenue collection, compounded by inefficiencies in public expenditures

that result in rigidity and underinvestment in human capital. The competitiveness challenge is a mix of several areas
where Sri Lanka is behind comparator countries, most notably in fostering adequate skills in the labor force, but also
in other areas such as FDI attraction, investment climate,
and promotion of innovation. The inclusion challenge is
both spatial in the urban areas and remote “pockets of
poverty” as well as cross cutting across ethnic, gender and
age differences in Sri Lanka’s population. Governance is a
challenge in all areas, but is particularly manifested in regulatory constraints and an outsized public sector. Finally,
there are important sustainability risks, including the need
to: maintain peace and security; carry through with governance reforms; address longer-term economic challenges
of an aging population; and balance imperatives to grow
with stewardship of Sri Lanka’s natural assets as a basis for
lasting prosperity and quality of life.
31. There are particularly important areas of synergy that provide for progress on inclusion, sustainability and growth. For instance, effective governance of cities will not only be critical for addressing spatial inclusion
challenges, but could also improve the benefits of urban
agglomeration and raise the level of overall growth and
job-creation. Good governance in urbanizing areas is also
important to balance social, environmental, and economic
equity concerns to allow for Sri Lanka to benefit long term
from its relatively unharmed natural asset base. Similarly,
improving equality of opportunity (including addressing
land claims) across ethnic groups is likely to be crucial for
improving social stability and sustainability of peace. Closing gender gaps is not only important in terms of social
inclusion, but is also critical in terms of the broader challenge of raising competitiveness and ensuring shared
prosperity, particularly given that an aging population will
increase the dependency rate.

I. Executive Summary

32. There is a particularly strong nexus of issues
around providing for skills development that meets
the needs of Sri Lanka’s economy. On one hand, there
are important elements of state performance needed
to improve the population’s skills mix: its ability to create more fiscal space to provide quality education to the
population, the efficiency of resources directed towards
human capital development, its ability to listen to and
partner with the private sector on ensuring that the right
skills are being provided, and the impact that it has on the
labor market given its outsized role as an employer. At the
same time, investment in skills, particularly with public financing, is integral to equipping the bottom 40 percent
with capacity to get good jobs, a fundamental means of
boosting shared prosperity. A more skilled labor force in
turn helps Sri Lanka become more competitive, including
within global value chains, as well as a more attractive destination for FDI.
33. Addressing the constraints and sustainability risks diagnosed in this report will require effective
leadership. Consultations conducted while preparing this
diagnostic showed that many of the identified constraints
were known, at least on an intuitive level. Indeed, with regard to several constraints, reforms or government interventions have been initiated to address problems such as
equality of opportunity in underserved areas or improving
Sri Lankans’ skill sets. The present government has articulated further plans to address other constraints outlined in
this diagnostic. Yet there also remain interests that support
the status quo, whether they are specific tax exemptions
or limitations on the number of slots available in higher
education institutions. Sri Lanka is at a crossroads in its
economic growth model and its governance framework
that will provide for an effective state to facilitate growth
and ensure social inclusion. Effective leadership will be
needed to steer it forward on a path that will continue its
strong progress in ending poverty and promoting shared
prosperity.

of the bottom 40 percent, including minorities and women. Evidence
base is strong for skills and trade policy issues.

INCLUSION
Proper urban management and effective governance of cities to
address locational concentrations of poverty
Multi-sector interventions to reduce poverty and promote
employment opportunities in areas with the highest poverty
rates (North, East, Moneragala, and estates)
Improve equality of opportunity across ethnic groups, regardless
of where they reside
Increase labor force participation of women and ensure equal
opportunity in access to jobs, political and private-sector
leadership
GOVERNANCE
Improve the regulatory environment to allow firms to grow and
enhance overall productivity in the economy
Review the regulatory role and participation of the public sector
in the economy
Improve the efficiency of the public sector
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustain peace and security through long-term reconciliation
efforts
Develop a more accountable and effective state
Place heavier emphasis on direct investment and equity portfolio
flows than debt
Preserve natural assets and address the impact of climate change
Address the long-term fiscal sustainability concerns related to
population aging

Urbanizing areas are associated with growth and an absolute majority
of poor are proximate to these areas. Ensuring continued benefits
of agglomeration will help progress for the majority of the poor. For
those living in more remote areas, more targeted interventions will be
needed to ensure equality of opportunity through improved service
delivery and greater participation in the labor force. Evidence base is
very strong.

Governance has cross-cutting impact on all other challenges. In
particular, labor, land, and other regulation create major distortions
in the economy. The size of the public sector leads to inefficient use of
public resources and distorts labor markets. The ability of government
to carry out core functions depends on effectiveness of the public
sector. Evidence base is strong.
Peace is sine qua non for continued investment, growth, and
personal well-being of large segment of the population. Sustaining
the state’s institutional capability over the long term is integral
competent facilitation of private-sector-led growth. Macro-economic
and environmental sustainability are preconditions for continued
progress as well as capitalizing on the country’s asset base. Evidence
of associated risks is strong.

II. Country Context

A. Political and Social Context
34. Sri Lanka is in many respects a development
success story. With economic growth averaging over
7 percent a year over the past five years on top of an average growth of 6 percent the preceding five years, Sri
Lanka has made notable strides in reducing poverty and
promoting shared prosperity. The national poverty headcount ratio declined from 22.7 to 6.7 percent between
2002 and 2012/13, with most of the reduction occurring
in the early part of the past decade. Growth has been propoor for most of the past decade, with consumption per
capita of the bottom 40 percent growing at 3.3 percent
a year, compared to 2.8 percent for the total population.
Other human development indicators are also impressive
by regional and lower middle-income standards. Sri Lanka
outperforms nearby country comparators on most Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly with regard to poverty reduction, health, and environmental sustainability. Coverage for primary school is near universal,
while secondary and tertiary enrollment has substantially
increased. Maternal and infant mortality rates are now at
very low levels, and life expectancy, at 74 years, has been
above its regional peers for over a decade. (See Appendix
1.1 for review of Sri Lanka’s performance on MDGs.)
35. The country’s achievements are impressive given
the complex relationships among its communities that
have led to conflict in the past. Sri Lanka is home to ethnic majority Sinhala; Sri Lankan Tamils, of whom many are
concentrated in the north and east; Moors (Muslims) concentrated in the east, northwest, coastal areas of the south,
and urban areas; Indian origin Tamils concentrated in the
highlands and estate sector; and other less numerous ethnic groups including Malays and Burghers. Urban populations, particularly the capital Colombo, have diverse ethnic
composition. Providing for social inclusion and peaceful
co-existence and interaction
among communities has

challenge These tensions were a driving force contributing to the
emergence in the late 1970s
of armed Tamil militant formations, which in turn came
to be dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE). A four-phased war between the LTTE and the Sri
Lankan state spanning 26 years ended with the military
defeat of the LTTE and deaths of most of its leaders in May
2009. Taken together with youth insurrections that led to

conflict in the 1970s and 1980s1, direct and indirect costs
of conflict through additional expenditures, losses in physical and human capital, and foregone investment have
been estimated to be equivalent to over 5 percent of GDP
per year during the period 1978-2005.2 This calculation of
economic costs does not include the impact of loss of life
and other physical and psychological trauma.
36. The end of the conflict has led to much greater
security for Sri Lankans and an opportunity to achieve
lasting reconciliation. There is no longer the pervasive
threat of violence that had long impacted development.
The state controls law and order across the island, resulting in improvements in overall security. Security in turn
provides for higher quality of life and stimulates economic
activity at many levels. At the same time, the major political parties associated with the Tamil population work
within Sri Lanka’s institutional framework at provincial and
national levels while continuing to articulate their community’s issues. The main Tamil political grouping played
an important role in supporting the January 2015 election
of Sri Lanka’s new president, Maithripala Sirisena. Security
and inclusive politics provide space for coming to a lasting
settlement that would overcome grievances that fueled
conflict in the past.
37. There have been significant efforts to rebuild
conflict-affected areas. Sri Lanka has heavily invested in
developing infrastructure throughout the country over
the past five years, including in the conflict-affected areas
of the north and east. A total of 5.2 percent of all budget
expenditures excluding interest payments were spent directly on reconstruction efforts in the Northern Province
alone in the period 2009-2013.3 These efforts have included a painstaking demining effort covering targeted areas
comprising over 2000 square kilometers that is 95 percent
complete as of the beginning of 2014, making farming
possible in many fields which had been off limits. While
levels of public service provision remain lower in the north
and east, there has been visible progress in improving road
and rail networks and installing housing, power transmission, water supply systems and other infrastructure. The
roughly 700,000 internally displaced people caused by the
conflict have almost all returned to their homes or have
otherwise voluntarily resettled elsewhere. The population
in former conflict areas continues to face many hurdles in

1 In addition to conflict involving Sri Lankan Tamils, there were two
insurrections of leftist political groups composed of mostly Sinhalese
against the Sri Lankan state in 1971 and 1987-89. There was also conflict
in preceding decades among Sri Lankan Tamil armed groups, ending
with the LTTE virtually eliminating its rivals.

rebuilding their lives but resettlement after the conflict
has been overall positive with 93 percent resettled on their
own lands.4
38. Particularly after the election of President Sirisena in 2015, the government has taken actions to address grievances of the Sri Lankan Tamil community.
Following the end of the conflict, the preceding government established the LLRC and implemented several of
the commission’s recommendations. In particular, Northern Provincial Council elections were held in 2013 and
were won by the main Tamil opposition party. Steps to
address grievances have been accelerated under President Sirisena, most notably: the appointment of a civilian
as governor in the Northern Province; the commitment to
a domestic mechanism to address issues of accountability for allegations of misconduct during and particularly at
the end of the conflict; and the return of some of the lands
that had been taken for military bases in the North and
East. The more pro-active stance of government responds
to a key LLRC finding on the causes of conflict: “Successive
governments since independence have been unable to
fully resolve, and in some instances actually contributed to,
communal tensions, particularly those involving the Tamil
community.” While much remains to be done on reconciliation, these steps work towards providing for long-term
sense of security, justice and jobs for all communities, all of
which are critical factors for avoiding renewal of conflict.5
39. Sri Lanka is also at the threshold of major institutional and political reforms advocated by the new
political leadership elected in 2015. Since the passage
of its 1978 Constitution, Sri Lanka has been dominated
by an “Executive Presidency” that enjoyed wide-ranging
powers, including the unlimited right to appoint and dismiss key officers of nearly all state institutions and no accountability to other state institutions. The preponderance
of the presidency created a centralized government and
decision-making apparatus with weak checks and balances. Sirisena’s victory in elections over two-term President
Rajapaksa, the country’s dominant political figure for the
preceding nine years, was based on a platform of good
governance that received diverse support. His government has prioritized securing passage of constitutional
amendments to reduce the powers of the presidency
while strengthening parliament, as well as legislation setting up a right to information regime, strengthened audit
and procurement regimes, and more vigorous anti-corruption efforts.

II. Country Context

40. Institutional reforms and efforts at reconciliation
are occurring against the backdrop of a fluid Sri Lankan polity. There are two major national parties and a large
number of smaller parties, including several with affiliation
to ethnic groups. Electoral competition has been robust at
national and provincial levels, most notably in the recent
presidential elections. At the same time, public figures exercise substantial autonomy – with prominent instances
of switching party allegiances, most notably in the recent
presidential elections. The fluid polity has prompted formal and informal coalition building as well as the need for
regular attention from the country’s leadership to sustain
support from often diverse bases. The fluidity of the environment has been evident in securing the passage of
constitutional and electoral reforms that required extensive political negotiations. A new government involving
a grand coalition has been formed after the August 2015
general elections and is in the process of formulating its
economic and other policies.
41. As Sri Lanka aspires to become a higher middle-income country, it will need to adjust its development model. Growth in the last five years is in substantial
part due to a “peace dividend”, which included significant
reconstruction efforts. Going forward, economic growth
will likely require continued structural changes in the
economy towards greater diversification and productivity increases and a reduction in the role of agricultural
employment from its present share of a third of the population. Although Sri Lanka has excelled in overcoming
human development challenges typical to a low-income
country, its service delivery systems in education, health
and other areas must now adjust to face new and changing demands typical of a MIC. Imperatives to improve social safety nets will increase owing to an aging population
that has passed its demographic peak. Finally, increasing
affluence and information will lead to higher expectations
for the state to perform in order to facilitate growth, provide a higher level of services, and demonstrate increasing
responsiveness to a more demanding citizenry.

B. Poverty and Shared Prosperity
42. Economic growth in Sri Lanka has been among
the fastest in South Asia in recent years. Growth has averaged 6.3 percent between 2002 and 2013, with per capita GDP rising from US$869 in 2000 to US$3,280 in 2013.
Moreover, the average growth rate accelerated to 7.5 percent between 2010 and 2013, reflecting a peace dividend
and an aggressive policy thrust towards growth since the
internal civil conflict ended. This growth is high as compared to regional and MIC peers, and has been accompanied by low inflation (Figure 2.1). Year 2014 also saw a continuation of the momentum with the economy growing by

7.4 percent compared to a 7.3 percent growth reported in
2013 on robust growth in industry and services.
43. Strong economic growth for over a decade has
led to an important decline in poverty and promoted
shared prosperity. Poverty, measured by per capita consumption, fell from 22.7 percent in 2002 to 6.7 percent in
2012/13 using the national poverty line6, which is equivalent to about US$1.50 in PPP terms. Extreme poverty fell
from 13.2 to 3.2 percent using the US$1.25-a-day poverty
line, while moderate poverty fell from 56.2 to 32.1 percent
using the $2.50-a-day poverty line, commonly used across
middle-income countries (Appendix 1.2), over the same
time period (Table 1).7
44. Poverty reduction measured by per capita consumption is also reflected in increased per capita incomes, particularly for the poor. Between 2006/07 and
2012/2013, average per capita incomes grew only slightly,
about 2 percent overall (Figure 2.2A). Growth in household
income reported here is on per capita terms, and contrasts

6 Given the ongoing conflict, a few regions were not included in the
2002 household survey. When looking at comparable regions, the decline
in poverty was from 22.7 percent in 2002 to 6.1 percent in 2012/13.
7 The national poverty line is expected to be updated soon in order to:
(i) update household consumption patterns (the current line assumes the
2002 consumption pattern), (ii) incorporate methodological best practice particularly with respect to the minimum calorie requirement and
the appropriate amount of non-food expenditure consistent with that
minimum threshold, and (iii) set a more ambitious benchmark, appropriate for a country at Sri Lanka’s stage of development, to measure future
progress against poverty.

with the figures on total household income reported by
the Department of Census ans Statistics (DCS), which remained roughly constant in real terms. The discrepancy
arises mainly because average household size fell during
this period. Because larger households require more income than smaller households to maintain the same
standard of living, per-capita income is preferred to total
income as a measure of household welfare. However, for
poorer households measured as those with lower per capita consumption, growth in real per capita income was over
twice as fast, and was in line with similar growth rates in
per capita consumption.
45. The reduction in poverty for the 2002 – 2012/13
period is also reflected in multidimensional measures.
Households in the bottom 40 percent were increasingly able to afford to purchase non-food items, as the food
budget share for this group fell from 67 percent in 2002 to
56 percent in 2012/13. Ownership of durable assets also
rose, especially among the poorest. Primary education attendance is essentially universal. Secondary school attendance is also high and continued to nudge upward during
this period. Completion, on the other hand, saw a major
increase, as the share of 17 and 18 year olds who completed secondary school rose from 40 to 60 percent between
2002 and 2012/13. Health indicators also improved during
this period. The rate of infant mortality fell from 13 to eight
children per thousand births, and the rate of under-nutrition, while still high, decreased from 30 to 25 percent (Figure 2.2B).
46. Despite the reduction in extreme poverty, living
standards remain low for most Sri Lankans and a large

47. Moreover, while the decline in poverty was
strong, it was below what one could have expected given the sustained high growth rates over the last decade
Indeed, a 1 percent increase in per-capita GDP reduced the
US1.25-a-day poverty rate by only 0.2 percentage points
while a similar increase in growth led to stronger reductions in extreme poverty in other regional and developing
countries (Figure 2.3). It has, however, been in line with
other post-conflict countries.
48. Growth was higher in the post-war period but
the strongest reduction in poverty and improvement
in shared prosperity occurred in the early part of the
10-year period covered by the past three Household

Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES). Per capita consumption of the bottom 40 percent grew at a rate of 3.5
percent for the 2002-2012/13 period, considerably faster
than the average growth of 3 percent for the total population over the same time period.8 Simple decompositions

growth was disproportionately in favor of the poorer half of the population (“propoor”) up until 2009. Although poverty continued to decline between 2009/10 and 2012/13, growth of the bottom
half of the distribution was slower than growth for the top
half, leading to an increase in inequality. This can easily be
seen in the growth incidence curves (GICs) shown in Figure
2.4. The x-axis shows households ordered from poorest to
richest, while the y-axis shows growth in household consumption. Between 2002 and 2009/10, growth was faster
at the bottom of the distribution, thus leading to a negatively sloped GIC – denoting pro-poor growth. In contrast,

between 2009/10 and 2012/13, growth at the top of the
distribution was faster, leading to a positively sloped GIC.
49. The most recent growth pattern has led to an increase in inequality. The corollary of stronger growth for
the top of the distribution between 2009/10 and 2013/14
is that inequality increased.
Growth was pro-poor Standard measures of insuch as the Gini coup until 2009 while equality,
efficient, increased from 0.36
inequality increased in 2009/10 to 0.39 in 2012/13,
between 2009/10 leading to an inequality level
and 2013/14 almost as high as the one
registered in 2006/07, before
the end of the civil war (Table 1 on page 13). In effect, rising inequality tempered the
poverty-reducing impact of growth.
50. Inequality has not only increased, but disparities
across the different ethnic and religious groups remain.
Poverty declined fastest for Sri Lankan Moors (Muslims): if
in 2002 one out of four Sri Lanka Moors was poor, 10 years
later only about one every 18 Sri Lanka Moors was poor
(or 6 percent), very close to the share of Sinhalese who are
poor. In 2012/13, Sri Lankan Tamils had the highest rates
of poverty among ethnic groups (Figure 2.5A). Among the
different religious groups surveyed in 2012/13 (which, in
most cases, have a strong correlation with ethnicity), Hindus had the highest poverty rates: 12 percent were poor,
as opposed to 6 percent of Buddhists, Muslims and Christians (Figure 2.5B).

II. Country Context

51. Other multidimensional measures also show inequality in outcomes. Sri Lanka successfully reached full
enrollment in primary education (grades 1 to 9), but education attainment of higher levels of education remains
strictly correlated to the well-being of households. For example, educational attainment among the poor is almost
half of what it is for the non-poor. Although the level of
education attainment has slowly increased both for poor
and non-poor individuals, poor individuals have a very low
likelihood of completing collegiate education. Similarly,
the poor are characterized by having lower access to electricity, telephone, water, and sanitation and having to travel further to reach health services. These characteristics are
especially true for those living on less than US$1.25-a-day
(Appendix 1.3)
52. Moreover, there is significant locational concentration of poverty in Sri Lanka. This is true both for
monetary and multidimensional outcomes, including
education, nutrition and access to services. The share of
people living under the national poverty line, known as
the headcount rate, is concentrated in three main areas
(Figure 2.6). The first is the former conflict districts in the
Northern Province, Mullaitivu, Manar, and, to a lesser extent, Kilinochchi District. The second is Batticaloa in the
Eastern Province, and the last one is Moneragala in the Uva
Province. Areas with higher poverty rates also tend to have
a larger portion of the bottom 40 percent.
53. Notwithstanding high rates of poverty in specific remote districts, the majority of the poor and as well
as the bottom 40 percent live in populous, effectively
urban areas in the center of the island. The location of

the poor broadly corresponds to the location of Sri Lanka’s population as a whole. Figure 2.7 shows estimates of
the number of people living in poverty. Kurunegala in the
center of the country, for instance, is home to 7.6 percent
of the country’s poor people even though only 7 percent
of its population lives under the official poverty line. In
contrast, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, and Mannar in the North,
have very high estimated poverty rates (20.8-31.4 percent),
but account for less than 5 percent of poor people nationwide due to the low population density in those regions.

C. Understanding Changes in Poverty
54. Between 2002 and
2012/13, most of the reduction in poverty was
due to higher labor incomes,9 and, in particular,
to increased earnings, as
opposed to higher employment or higher transfers. Most of the increase in labor income was, in turn,
due to increased returns to work both in and outside of

nearly 60% of reported
poverty reduction

overall growth in per capita income, partly due to smaller households as
discussed in paragraph 41 and footnote 6 above.

agriculture (Figure 2.8). Increased returns to agriculture
accounted for about 31 percent of the decline, of which
roughly two-thirds were higher returns to self-employed
farmers. The other main factor was an increase in the returns to paid non-farm work, which accounted for 28 percent of the poverty decline. Combined, increases in the
returns to work explain nearly 60 percent of the reported
poverty reduction. These increases in returns are associated with an increase in average real wages, which could be
due to either higher productivity or improved relative prices for the poor, given many are net producers. The finding
of sustained increases in real wages over the decade is in
line with results from alternate surveys conducted by the
Central Bank, which show a sharp increase in services and
government real wages from 2002 to 2013 and in industry
real wages in 2013.
55. Private transfers in the form of remittances, and
the increase in the working age population also helped.
Between 2002 and 2012/13 remittances increased from
0.4 to 0.9 percent of total incomes and total consumption
of the poorest 10 percent of households (Figure 2.9). Even
though this was an increase relative to the incomes of the
poor, most remittances in absolute amounts go to the
richer part of the population. The age composition of the
workforce also contributed to poverty reduction. The composition of the workforce in terms of gender, ethnicity and
religious composition remained stable over the course
of the decade. However, the share of 15-29 year-olds de-

56. In contrast to private transfers,
public transfers did not make a net contribution to poverty reduction over the
past decade. Public transfers (particularly the Samurdhi program) declined in real
terms, and as such, its net contribution to
reducing poverty was negative.10 In fact, results from analysis of the HIES show that the
decline in poverty would have been 10 percent greater had the real value of Samurdhi
remained constant. Finally, while both the
improvements in education and the demographic dividend (the larger share of working-age adults) helped to reduce poverty,
these were relatively small contributors to
poverty reduction (Figure 2.8).

10 That is, if nothing else had changed, poverty
would have increased simply because the value of
these transfers was lower in real terms in 2012/13 relative to 2002. There are multiple social programs in
Sri Lanka. The main direct cash transfer program is the
Samurdhi Poverty Alleviating Program, which includes
an income-support scheme that grants a monthly allowance according to the number of family members
in each household, an insurance scheme that provides
cash allowances during births, deaths and hospitalization of family members, nutrition programs for pregnant and lactating mothers and children of beneficiary
families, and scholarship programs for children.

clined from 26 to 20 percent between 2002 and 2012/13,
making the overall workforce relatively more experienced,
and thus likely to bring in higher labor incomes. It is also
a strong signal that the population is aging, which raises
concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability (see Chapter VI on economic sustainability and aging).

57. It is very difficult to attribute the reasons for
the increase in labor incomes. To the extent that there
was both an increase in employment as well as increases
in wages, this is consistent with an overall increase in demand for workers. Increases in labor demand, as indicated
by increases in employment and/or wages, appear to be
broadly spread across many sectors rather than concentratedin a few (Figure 2.10). Despite relatively high annual
changes in wages in the agriculture sector it still experienced a decline in employment, reflecting that overall
returns are lower compared to other sectors. The increase
in construction employment reflects the overall growth
in the construction sector, especially after the end of the
conflict.
58. There are four potential drivers of the increase in
labor incomes and its poverty impacts over the last 10
years. The following section
focuses on these drivers: (i)

increases that led to higher labor earnings for agricultural
workers.

Structural Transformation
59. The economy saw a shift from agriculture to industry and services in the last 15 years (Figure 2.11A).
The share of value added from agriculture fell from 19.9
percent of GDP in 2000 to 10.8 percent in 2013 and is expected to have declined to 10 percent in 2014,11 while the
share of value added from industries increased from 26.5
to 32.5 percent over the same period. Employment in agriculture declined from 36 to 31 percent between 2000 and
2012 and increased in industry and services over the same
period (Figure 2.11B). It is noteworthy that a major part of
the decline in agricultural employment (and rise in industry) occurred only in 2012, the last year measured.
60. The shift toward employment in the industry
sector and the expansion in services was associated
with increases in productivity. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth accounted for about half of Sri Lanka’s
growth over the last decade contributing on average 3¼
percentage points per year, rising to about 3½ percentage
points recently.12 A range of empirical approaches suggest
that potential growth has risen by almost 1 percentage

point to about 6¾ percent in recent
years compared to the period 2003–08.
This appears to reflect equally capital
deepening (through increased investment on infrastructure and equipment)
and improved factor productivity,
with labor’s contribution broadly unchanged. Most of the increase in productivity took place within the industry
and service sectors (Figure 2.12A), but
an inter-sector shift in employment
away from agriculture and into industry and services also played a role and
could partly explain increases in labor
incomes (Figure 2.12B).

Figure 2.13 Night lights image of Sri lanka, 1975- 2014

Agglomeration Effects
61. Along with this structural
transformation, Sri Lanka has been
experiencing a dynamic spatial
transformation process of urbanization and agglomeration in the past
two decades. Urbanization13 and ag-

13 According to official estimates, only 15.7
percent of Sri Lanka’s population lives in urban
areas, making it the least urbanized country in
South Asia and MICs. This is due to the country’s
conservative definition of urban as population
living in ‘town’ and ‘municipal’ administrative
units last demarcated in the 1980s. This does not
capture Sri Lanka’s level of population agglomeration described here. A 2010 agglomeration in-

glomeration have been occurring in two forms: one is the
prime multi-city agglomeration of Kandy-Colombo-Galle
in the Western Province, which is the largest in the country and has also experienced the bulk of the growth. The
second form is a few localized single-city agglomerations
in the eastern and northern parts of the country, mainly
around Trincomalee, Batticaloa-Akkaraipattu, and Jaffna.
This spatial transformation process has profound implications for both economic growth and alleviating poverty
and vulnerability. The agglomeration spawning from the
Colombo Metropolitan Region along the two corridors
to Kandy and Galle/Matara is evolving to become a functional multi-city urban agglomeration. Recent growth, in
particular, around Colombo, Kandy and Galle, including
the corridors that connect those cities, is evident in the red
lighting in Figure 2.13, which represents night-time lights
that were present in 2012 but not in 2002 or 1992.
62. Agglomeration may have been fueling growth
and partly determining national performance. Economic growth in Sri Lanka has been partly driven by
highly built-up areas. Using night-time lights data as a
proxy for GDP for the 2001-2011 period shows that a small
number of regions are responsible for a larger share of
national growth. In fact, 10 percent of Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) contributed nearly 30 percent of the
country’s growth over the period (Figure 2.14A). Furthermore, only 20 percent of DSDs contributed almost half of

all growth in Sri Lanka. Satellite imagery on built-up areas
by DSDs can be combined with night-light information to
see the correlation between built-up areas and growth.
Not surprisingly, a larger share of built-up areas is positively correlated to national growth measured using nighttime lights (Figure 2.14B). That is, urbanization and growth
have been moving hand in hand.

Increases in Aggregate Demand, including
Government Infrastructure Projects
63. Domestic demand was largely responsible for
growth. Private consumption accounted for 67 percent
of GDP in 2013, having expanded by 6 percent a year
on average between 2002 and 2013 (Figure 2.15A). Private investment, on the other hand, accounted for 23 percent of GDP in 2013, after an average growth of 9 percent a
year during the same time period. In addition, public infrastructure spending grew at an average rate of 18 percent
a year between 2002 and 2013, and made up 6 percent of
GDP by 2013 (Figure 2.15B). The impulse coming from exports, on the other hand, was very small, with an average
growth rate of 4 percent a year, so that the contribution
of exports to aggregate demand declined from 35 to 26
percent of GDP between 2002 and 2013.

Increased Commodity Prices
64. Higher real wages, especially in agriculture,
played a key role in reducing poverty. Although agriculture is no longer a major contributor to growth (accounting for under 11 percent of GDP), around one-third

66. In contrast, rising domestic and international
food prices may have provided space for the increase
in the agricultural minimum wage and corresponding
increases in agricultural wages. Rising food prices, particularly from 2006 to 2009, provided additional profits
to agricultural producers In addition, international prices
for tea rose more than 50 percent, from $2.1 to $3.3 per
kg between 2006 and 2009. This occurred despite little
change in yields. The increase in the price for tea provided space for increasing the real minimum wage for agricultural workers (Figure 2.17A), although they continue to
be lower than wages in industry and services. Agricultural
wages, unlike those for industrial and service sector wages, tracked these minimum wage increases almost exactly
(Figure 2.17B).

D. Macroeconomic Challenges to
Poverty Reduction and Shared
Prosperity
67. Recent growth has been mainly led by the
non-tradable sectors. Sri Lanka’s real GDP grew by 43 percent from 2009 to 2014. The top four sectors contributing
to 50 percent of the total growth during the period were
all non-tradable sectors: construction, transport, domestic
trade and banking, and insurance and real estate (Figure
2.18). Reflecting the intensity of a needed post-conflict infrastructure development thrust, the construction sector
alone contributed to 16.8 percent of the total growth while
growing by 109 percent in real terms. The transport sector
contributed to 14 percent of the total growth, reflecting
improved transportation infrastructure and increased ve-

trade (7.8 percent) and financial services (8.2 percent) were
the other main contributors
to growth. Less prominent

growth while all other mangrowth were all nonufacturing/service sectors

tradable sectors
44.7 percent of the growth.
Moreover, Sri Lanka’s share
of manufacturing output, which was 18.7 percent in 2000,
rose to 19.5 percent in 2005 and declined to 17.2 percent
by 2014 due to faster growth in the services sector.
68.
Reliance on non-tradable sectors for growth
could make it difficult to sustain the momentum in the
long run. While data is lacking on the breakdown between
private- and public-sector involvement across industries,
there is strong indication that public investment to rebuild
following the end of conflict is responsible for much of the
proportionately large growth in construction as well as
transport (which is inclusive of some transport infrastructure). It would appear unlikely that these sectors would
underpin sustained growth going into the future owing to
fiscal space limitations as well as a decline in the need for
post-conflict reconstruction. More generally, construction
and transport infrastructure are not likely to be sources of
sustained, consistent growth.
69.
In contrast, there has been a steady decline in
commodity exports. Before 1977, Sri Lanka’s development strategy, based on import substitution, aimed to

70. Moreover, the configuration of production in Sri
Lanka has remained largely constant in the last three
decades. At the same time some MIC comparators, like
Thailand, have been highly successful at diversifying their

economies and leveraging existing industries to move up
the value chain as well as fostering the development of

aimed to liberalize the foreign trade regime and Sri Lanka

open its borders to trade and foreign direct investment.
In the decades that followed, trade of goods and services
increased to 89 percent of GDP in 2000, with tea and highend apparel exports leading

FDI remains below 2 percent
of GDP five years after the
end of armed conflict. The decline in openness and stagnating FDI took place when the rest of the world was integrating more strongly and global trade was accelerating.
Sri Lanka’s world market share has consequently declined
to levels last seen in the 1980s.

1980 but a much different one by 2009. Thailand now has
much lower activity in resource-based and labor-intensive
exports and instead has dense clusters in electronics, microcircuits and machinery.

II. Country Context

71. While the trade deficit has recently improved, Sri
Lankan exports face structural challenges. In particular, the tradable sectors are facing rising production costs,
particularly for Sri Lanka’s main agricultural exports (tea
and rubber).15 Similarly, although garment exports have
increased in nominal terms and there has been movement
to higher added-value production, the share of garment
exports relative to GDP has continuously declined. Weaker
external demand from the European Union (EU) and the
United States and rising relative labor costs has also affect-

15 This has always been an issue as plantation workers (tea and rubber)
have historically been very well organized under political leadership of
the Ceylon Workers Congress. Their strong bargaining power has driven
a wedge between wage and productivity trends. Many workers are paid
even if they do not have work.

74.
On the fiscal front, low and
declining fiscal revenues have become
a key macro-economic concern for Sri
Lanka. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio,
which amounted to 24.2 percent in 1978,
declined to 14.5 percent in 2000 and
reached 10.7 percent in 2014 despite an
annual increase in GDP per capita of 11
percent a year (Figure 2.22). This partly led
to large fiscal deficits, particularly before
end of conflict, when Sri Lanka averaged
deficits of around 7-8 percent of GDP a
year. Over the past five years, the government has made an effort towards fiscal
consolidation, reducing the budget deficit
from 9.9 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in
2014.

73. The current account deficit has been financed mostly by external borrowing, rather
than through FDI. Much of this external borrowing by the public and private sectors went
to finance the country’s rebuilding following
the end of the conflict. Despite this borrowing
to cover current account deficits, Sri Lanka has
been able to reduce its debt to GDP ratio in the
past five years thanks to fast growth, relatively
low real interest rates and a stable exchange
rate. This also shows where the risks are: a slowdown in growth, increasingly commercial terms
on new borrowing, and exchange rate volatility
may reverse the decline in the level of external
debt-to-GDP.

at 12.5 percent of the outstanding value (Central Bank,
2015). About 44 percent of the public debt stock is external, so that exchange rate fluctuations and any rupee depreciation could risk deteriorating the debt indicators.
76. More generally, twin deficits in the fiscal and
current accounts are mirrored by low national savings, with a persistent savings-investment gap being
financed mostly through debt-creating flows over the
last decade. National savings has averaged about 25 percent of GDP since 2010, while national investment was as
high as 31 percent of GDP.16 Most of this gap has been covered by debt-creating flows, as opposed to FDI over the
last decade. Despite strong GDP growth, the external debt
amounted to about 57 percent of GDP at end-2014.

E. Identifying Drivers and
Constraints to Poverty Reduction
and Shared Prosperity
77. The context outlined in this section sets the
stage for a systematic diagnostic of drivers and constraints to poverty reduction and shared prosperity
going forward. Sri Lanka’s political, social, and economic
features are the result of a wide variety of factors. These
same factors, particularly the more proximate factors that
are in effect at present, are expected to drive or constrain
continued progress on the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. At the same time, there are
new trends and emerging opportunities that will also
play a role in shaping Sri Lanka’s development trajectory
in the coming years. The goal of this SCD is to take stock
of these factors, identify their relative importance, and set
out what would therefore be priorities to be addressed in
order to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. The SCD focuses on drivers and constraints of progress in the next five years, corresponding to the term of
the new government to be formed after elections in the
summer of 2015.

II. Country Context

78. This diagnostic is based on a systematic and
detailed review of key potential factors impacting
progress on the twin goals. In order to identify these
constraints we used a hybrid framework that combines
the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva
(2014) assets-based framework as detailed in Appendix
1.4. The framework was used as a way to organize and
discipline the analysis by identifying a broad range of 22
areas where there were possible constraints to, or drivers
of, progress on the twin goals. Sri Lanka’s performance
in each area was assessed and weighed for their relative
impact on achieving the twin goals. This preliminary systematic analysis was then presented in a set of detailed
consultations with multiple stakeholders, including government, academia, think tanks, the private sector, civil
society organizations, and international organizations to
validate the findings, determine the relative importance
of issues identified in each of the 22 areas, and identify
knowledge gaps.
79. Discussion around the preliminary analysis and
ensuing consultations led to a consensus around four
major themes, which form the basis for organizing this
report and the major challenges to progress along the
twin goals. The themes are: (i) Fiscal sustainability and the
need to ensure fiscal space for development; (ii) Fostering
growth and jobs for the bottom 40 percent; and (iii) ensuring spatial and social inclusion. The fourth major theme –
the importance of more effective and efficient governance
– is a cross-cutting issue in all three chapters, reflecting the
critical roles of public-sector management, government’s
interface with the private sector, and governance’s impact
on inclusion. These four major themes were recurrent in
discussions with multiple stakeholders in terms of the severity of constraints they pose for achieving the twin goals
of ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity. The
next three chapters describe each of these themes and
discuss the priority areas. Those are followed by a chapter
on economic, social and environmental sustainability concerns, which are also critical in achieving the twin goals.
The final chapter summarizes the main findings and provides conclusions.

KEY PRIORITIES IN ADDRESSING THE FISCAL CHALLENGE
■■

Maintaining continued commitment to fiscal sustainability will require long-term revenue measures.

■■

Simplifying the tax regime and improving tax administration to increase the tax base could reverse the declining
revenue trend.

■■

Low revenues and rigidity in expenditures undercut investment in human development while higher levels of
financing and effectiveness thereof are needed to meet Sri Lanka’s needs as it transitions to a MIC.

Inefficiencies in social protection and management of the public service particularly undermine efficient use of
resources.

government’s commitment to sustainability, the budgeted fiscal deficit is expected to narrow in 2015. However,
increases in recurrent expenditures are to be financed by
one-time taxes, ambitious revenue targets for existing taxes, and cuts in public investment, leaving very little room
to maneuver. Moreover, recurrent spending increases on

80. Sri Lanka’s government has demonstrated a
strong commitment to fiscal consolidation in the recent past. In the decade before end of conflict, the country averaged fiscal deficits of around 7-8 percent. However,
over the past five years, the government has trimmed budget deficits each year, going from 9.9 percent in 2009 to an
estimated 5.7 percent in 2014. The public debt, which was
hovering around 106 percent of GDP in 2002, was reduced
to 75.5 percent of GDP by 2014. Moreover, the government
has committed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent
of GDP by 2017 and public debt to 60 percent of GDP by
2020. With the exception of a spike in 2009 linked to massive recovery and rehabilitation needs immediately after
the war’s end, this has been achieved by reducing government expenditures.

81. This overall strong performance masks
four structural weaknesses in the government’s fiscal position: low, declining fiscal
revenues; increasing rigidity of expenditures; insufficient spending on key public
goods and services, particularly for human
development; and inefficiencies in the public sector. Preserving fiscal balance will become
increasingly challenging owing to an extremely
low revenue base combined with long-term-expenditure commitments including a relatively
large public service. If current trends continue,
the government will have limited fiscal space
to facilitate development. At the same time,
experience of regional and MIC comparators
suggests that Sri Lanka is not investing enough
in human development. The country’s past success in these areas cannot be expected to continue without significant increases in spending,
which in turn requires greater fiscal space.

wages and transfers initiated in 2015 will need to be sustained once the one-time revenue measures expire. Given
government plans to increase expenditures on education
and health from their present low levels, long-term increases in revenue will be needed in order to reduce the
fiscal deficit and public debt.

A. Low and Declining Fiscal Revenues
83. Sri Lanka now has one of the lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios in the world, and it has been declining for decades. The country’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio
amounted to 24.2 percent in 1978, after which it declined
to 14.5 percent in 2000 and to 11.6 percent in 2013 (Figure
3.1). The decline is in large part a reflection of Sri Lanka’s
strong GDP growth17 with revenues increasing in absolute terms. Nonetheless, the fact that revenues have not
kept pace with economic growth and barely kept pace
with inflation in absolute terms is a continuing constraint
on the budget. The government has signaled the need to
reverse this trend in recent budgets, each year planning
for a significant improvement in the tax revenue-to-GDP
ratio over the medium term. However, projections of revenue increases have consistently failed to materialize (Figure 3.2A). In comparison, most of the other South Asian
countries as well as middle-income countries have seen
modest improvements in tax collection in the recent past.
(Figure 3.2B).

17 During the period 2000 to 2013, the per capita GDP grew from USD
869 to 3280 at 11 percent annually.

84. Indirect taxes account for 80 percent of Sri Lanka’s tax revenue. The country has lower-than-expected
revenues from taxes on income, profits, or capital (direct
taxes) and higher collections from international trade and
from good and services (indirect taxes) than its peers,
both as a share of total revenues and as a share of GDP18
(Figure 3.3). The dependency on indirect taxes, -- mostly
VAT, excise and customs revenue – limits the country’s capabilities to expand the tax base and raises issues regarding the equity of the system and how the tax burden is
distributed among social groups.

trade liberalization and a
gradual reduction of external trade taxation have lowered tax revenues from international trade. This effect
was exacerbated by measures introduced in 2012 to curb
imports (see Chapter IV for a detailed discussion of trade
policies). Second, tax reforms initiated in 2011 streamlined
import taxes, unified VAT rates, and abolished some “nuisance” taxes to improve the transparency and efficiency

18 Collectively, these taxes accounted for 77 percent of the total tax
revenue in 2013 whilst income taxes and telecommunication levy contributed to 20 and three percent of tax revenues respectively.

of the tax system. However, the unification of the VAT was
at a lower rate, and corporate and income tax rates were
lowered without a commensurate broadening of the tax
base. Third, the authorities have introduced numerous tax
exemptions and holidays to boost foreign investment or
support specific activities, resulting in an erosion of the tax
base (see below). Finally, tax exemptions have made tax
administration more difficult, discouraged tax compliance,
and created demand for new exemptions.
86. A decline in VAT collection is the main driver of
tax-revenue-to GDP reduction in recent years. The VAT’s
share in total revenue has declined from 43 percent in

III. Addressing the Fiscal Challenge

2004 to 25 percent in 2013, while the decline in the tax-toGDP ratio broadly tracks that of the decline in the VAT-toGDP ratio (Figure 3.4). VAT collection is weak at 2.9 percent
of GDP in 2013 with a c-efficiency20 of 25 percent, which
is roughly half of the c-efficiency for lower middle-income
countries. Domestic-based consumption taxes have remained at the same share over time, while there has been
a marginal increase in import-based taxes, excise taxes,
trade taxes, and the Nation Building Tax (NBT), a cascading

20 “C-efficiency” is the tax collection as a share of the tax base divided
by the tax rate. See Ebrill, 2001 and Keen, 2013.

indirect tax using a similar base to the VAT, as a share of total revenue. On the other hand, the share of the corporate
income tax collection increased, as did the “special taxes,”
such as the Social Responsibility Levy (SRL) and devolved
duties to Provincial Councils.
87. Sri Lanka’s low tax revenues are caused primarily
by problems with tax administration allowing for weak
compliance. The country ranks 158th out of 189 countries
in paying taxes due to the high number of payments (47),
time taken (167 hours per year) and tax rate (55.6 percent
of profits), according to Doing Business 2015 Report. A
2013 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability report similarly identifies weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s tax administration, particularly indicators for collection of gross
tax in arrears, clarity and comprehensives of tax liabilities
and effectiveness of penalties on non-compliance (Figure
3.5).
88. There are multiple institutions involved with tax
administration. Under the MoF, there are three agencies
involved in tax collection, including the Department of
Customs, Department of Excise and the Inland Revenue
Department (IRD), with the latter collecting less than 50
percent of total government revenues.21 There is high ro-

tation of staff, which results in the downgrading of specialized skills in tax administration. With regard to tax policy,
there is significant influence and overlap from agencies
other than the tax authorities (e.g. Board of Investment
Tax administration
- BOI), which frequently
grant tax exemptions that is complex and
further undermine revenue inefficient
administration capabilities.
There is limited data sharing
between the Customs and IRD, but not among other entities, although reforms are planned to overcome this issue.
89. Tax administration is complex and inefficient,
though increased use of IT expected in the near future
may lead to improvement over the medium term. At
present, the system relies heavily on self-reporting for direct taxes and there is a lack of regulations covering penalties for non–compliance with registration requirements
for the corporate income tax. Monitoring compliance is
split by type of tax and customer segment within the IRD.
In November 2015 the IRD plans to launch the first phase
of a Revenue Administration Management Information
System, which is designed to enable information sharing,
integrate taxpayer information from 22 government institutions, and provide for online tax filing for the first time.
Other countries, notably Sri Lanka’s neighbor India, have
been able to improve administration in recent years largely thanks to IT improvements. Yet, global experience also
indicates that rolling out such systems and implementing

ators Thailand and Malaysia (62nd and 32nd, respectively).
A 2015 study of the administrative burdens showed a reduction of 43 hours in the number of hours required for
corporate tax compliance due to improvements in electronic systems for filing and paying taxes. The number
of hours endured by firms in Sri Lanka is now lower than
many peers, but the number of payments remains somewhat higher (Table 3.1).
91. Sri Lanka also provides a large number of tax
privileges, though a tax expenditure analysis to assess
their fiscal impact has not been carried out. Since the
introduction of a VAT in 2002, successive changes in the
tax regime have led to an increase from around 200 to over
500 types of exemptions for a wide variety of goods. There
are also over 40 broad types of exemptions on corporate
and personal income tax

income and the type of tax- VAT exemptions have

to income tax exemptions in 2012, the BOI can continue
to approve incentives on customs duties, VAT and other

plied to entities implementing 13 large projects thus far
approved under the 2010 Strategic Development Act. Annual budgets in recent years regularly include a package
of new tax incentives targeting specific sectors or types of
payers. Tax expenditure analysis is not conducted before
or after the introduction of incentives, and statements of
tax expenditures are not compiled or published.
92. Multiple incentives regimes have also led to coordination problems, further undermining effective
administration. Firms have been granted tax incentives
by BOI generally are not monitored by the IRD (with the
exception of corporate income tax since 2013) since the
latter does not consider other tax matters related to BOI
investors under its ambit. There has been no formal system
of sharing information between the two agencies, which
further complicates monitoring by IRD. Follow up to ensure that firms began to pay taxes after tax holidays ended
did not occur.
93. In contrast, Sri Lanka’s statutory tax rates are
comparable to many middle-income countries, though
features of policy concerning VAT undercut revenue
mobilization because of the administrative burdens
that arise. The VAT statutory tax rate is in line with other
middle-income countries, while its individual income tax
rates are somewhat lower and corporate income tax rates
are relatively high by international standards (Tables 3.2
and 3.3). Tax policy with regard to VAT includes unusual
features that create additional administrative burdens.
In particular, Sri Lanka employs a “simplified VAT” regime
whereby significant registered exporters are entitled to
purchase goods and services from similarly registered
suppliers free of VAT, obviating the need for a refund. Enforcing compliance is complicated because there is no

chain of transactions and hence IRD will not detect what
is occurring unless businesses declare the goods and services. The over 500 exemptions to VAT pose similar disruptions and monitoring challenges for IRD. Finally, although
thresholds for payment of VAT have been raised since last
year, the threshold likely remains too high, given the still
small number of VAT-payers (roughly 15,000 registered
payers).

94. Low tax revenues combined with an expenditure
profile that is effectively non-discretionary has led to
a lean, rigid budget. Sri Lanka’s overall revenues and expenditures are among the lowest in the region. There is
little flexibility in the short term on the expenditure side
of the budget. Sixty percent of expenditure in 2013 was
on items that the government cannot readily reduce: interest payments, salaries, and transfer payments (Figure
3.6). Nearly two-thirds of transfer payments are pensions
for civil servants, which are a commitment that must be
met, with the remainder fertilizer subsidies, social protection payments and other transfers. Furthermore, Sri Lanka
has had a large expansion in the number of public servants in the past 10 years, growing from 646,000 in 2004 to
1.06 million in 2013, an increase of nearly two-thirds (MoF
2014). This growth reflects explicit policies to provide public service jobs, especially for university graduates (see below). These trends will only grow the wage/allowance and
pension burdens.
95. There is moderate risk in Sri Lanka’s public debt
profile. There has been significant accumulation of public
debt in recent years, mostly from abroad. Although much
improved from earlier years where the debt stock was over
100 percent of GDP, public debt stood at 75.5 percent of
GDP at end-2014 and could pose macro-economic risks
if growth moderates in coming years. The composition of

debt is also changing, moving from concessional lending
to shorter-term commercial borrowings. However, during
2014 there has been a systematic conversion of short-term
T-bill issuance into longer-term T-bonds, while foreign
holdings of T-bills and bonds have been contained at 12.5
percent of the outstanding value (Central Bank, 2015).

of Treasury guarantees given to various state and nonstate entities to expedite the development work increased
from 1.6 percent to 5.7 percent of GDP from 2006 to

to institutions with stable revenue streams23 declined from
90 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2014 while guarantees

relative to other middle-income countries (Figure 3.8B), particularly given the rising
costs of healthcare associated with an aging population.
Moreover, Sri Lanka faces increasing demands for a more
skilled workforce to be able to compete globally while
meeting the aspirations of the youth, as described in the
next two chapters.
98. Sri Lanka’s expenditure on social protection programs has also declined steadily in recent years. The
total amount of transfers has increased in absolute terms
over the past decade, but has not kept pace with GDP
growth (Figure 3.9A). In 2013 two-thirds of social welfare
programs went to social transfers, while the remaining
third was spent on health and education programs, various subsidies, and absorbed losses of SOEs (primarily the
Railways, Postal Service and Transport Board) (Figure 3.9B).
Moreover, growth in absolute terms has been driven by a
significant increase in pensions and to a lesser extent, fertilizer subsidies. Because Sri Lanka’s state pension system
only encompasses public servants and the military, which

mostly represent better-off households, the poverty reduction impact of these transfers is limited. Most notably,
there was no increase until
2013 in absolute expenditures on the major anti-pov- Social transfers have

welfare program providing
cash transfers, housing assistance, subsidized kerosene and assistance to pregnant and
lactating mothers set up in 1994. Despite a small increase,
only 0.22 percent of GDP was spent on anti-poverty and disaster relief programs. New cash transfer programs for the
elderly and the disabled have been introduced but these
amounted to only 0.03 percent of GDP in 2013.
99. Low levels of public spending may undercut Sri
Lanka’s past strong gains in human development and
leave it less well equipped to face changing human development needs as a MIC. For decades Sri Lanka outperformed other lower-income countries in making steady
improvement on human development outcomes, such as
life expectancy, maternal health and educational enrollment (see Appendix 1.1 on achievement of the MDGs). It
is much closer to average in outcomes when compared to
other lower middle-income countries LMICs. Sustaining
progress will involve addressing different types of challenges more typical of a MIC. For instance, whereas Sri Lanka excelled in addressing communicable diseases in the
past, it now faces a bigger problem with non-communicable diseases reflecting an aging, more urban, and affluent
population. Similarly, the changing economy is placing

will place further demands for more, cost-effective infrastructure, particularly power.

100. Sri Lanka will also need to finance infrastructure
needs to keep pace with increasing demand. Sri Lanka’s infrastructure compares favorably to its South Asian
neighbors in terms of accessibility, and the past five years
have seen a major expansion of public investment in infrastructure (see Appendix 2.1 for a more detailed review on
access and management issues for various infrastructure
sectors). In particular, over the past five years, the government has invested about 4.4 percent of its total expenditures (outside of interest payments) in infrastructure in the
Northern Province alone in order to redress imbalances.27
However, Sri Lanka’s needed investment remains high
in order to keep pace with the changes underway in the
country. In particular, increasing urbanization will require
more sophisticated infrastructure to maximize benefits
from agglomeration, provide for livability, and avoid congestion. With greater affluence will come increased use of
individual vehicles, currently growing at 10 percent a year
and set to displace the modal share of public transport
if demand management measures and public transport
development are not addressed (Figure 3.10). Structural

III. Addressing the Fiscal Challenge

101. In the past, the pressures on financing capital
investment were eased by waves of concessionary donor funding that will not continue because Sri Lanka
has reached middle-income status. Consequent to a
deteriorating security situation and political instability,
the international donor community substantially limited
official development assistant (ODA) to Sri Lanka through-

Figure 3.10 Usage patterns of vehicles, 1960-2030

out the 1990s. Donor aid surged following the signing of a
ceasefire between the government and LTTE in 2002 and
again following the Indian Ocean tsunami in December
2004. The combined effect of these was that ODA to Sri
Lanka rose from US$330 million (2 percent of GDP) in 1999
to $1.33 billion (5 percent of GDP) in 2005 – comprising
the highest level of aid to the country. Despite complications in disbursing post-tsunami aid in conflict areas due
to the lack of full government control there, social and
connective- infrastructure needs (roads particularly) in the
East and also in the deep South of the country were met
by generous donor funds, easing the pressure on public
funds. Given that Sri Lanka has achieved middle-income
status, this level of funding is not likely to materialize going forward, highlighting the imperative for domestic revenue mobilization.
102. Public investment will need to be applied effectively to crowd in other sources of financing. Public financing will remain important, but it will need to be
supplemented by more private sources to address infrastructure needs. In- recent years the government increased
expenditure on energy, water supply, transport and communications from under 11 percent of total spending in
2005 to around 20 percent
from 2009-13 (or
Effort should be annually
roughly 4 percent of GDP, exundertaken to cept 2009, which had a large

are some exceptions, infrawith private-sector structure was built thanks to
investment to address direct public financing. As is
at greater length
infrastructure needs discussed
in the next chapter, effort
should be undertaken to
leverage public funds with private-sector investment given the quantum of investment needs going forward.

D. Inefficiency in Social Transfers
103. In addition to low levels of spending, Sri Lanka’s social protection system has limited effectiveness.
Some of the programs classified as social transfers should
not be classified as such.28 Pensions account for most
transfers, but not surprisingly given the public service
background of pensioners, less than half of them are in the
bottom 40 percent (HIES 2012/13). Less than 30 percent of

the population over 65 drew a pension in 2013. Expanded
subsidies for fertilizer are available to all farmers (with differentiation in the amount of subsidy depending on the
crop); it can be argued in only the most general terms that
these farmers are relatively likely to be poor.
104. Anti-poverty programs suffer from poor targeting. In fact, analysis of the HIES shows that if it were possible to perfectly target individuals below the poverty line,
the amount needed to bring all poor individuals to the
poverty line would have been only 0.12 percent of GDP in
2013. Programs rely on manual registration and identification, and lack a capability to actively search for excluded
individuals. Although some programs have categorical eligibility criteria, more than half of Sri Lankans living below
the poverty line receive no benefits from existing social
assistance or social welfare programs (though they may
benefit from free health and education). At the same time,
a third of spending on social transfers goes to the richest
60 percent of the population. Samurdhi and School Lunch
programs transfer nearly the same amount to the bottom
quintile, and in both cases roughly 55 percent of benefits
go to the bottom 40 percent. The other three programs,
when considered as a group, distribute 53 percent of their
transfers to the bottom 40 percent (Figure 3.11). By tightening eligibility criteria and making an effort to register
the poor for benefits, existing spending could be more effective in combating poverty.
105. Fertilizer subsidies have limited impact on the
poor while creating negative distortions in the agriculture sector that undermine productivity. Fertilizer

subsidies are the least well-targeted transfer, with only 45
percent of the benefit being devoted to the bottom 40
percent (Figure 3.11). Furthermore, these subsidies have
distorted market decisions by encouraging cultivation of
certain crops, especially paddy, hindering the movement
to other types of agriculture that have more potential for
value addition. Even for targeted crops, these subsidies
have not prompted productivity increases.29 At the same
time, intensive usage of cheap fertilizers lead to environmental and potential human health hazards. Thus, subsidies negatively affect those in the bottom 40 percent
engage in agriculture across multiple dimensions, suggesting a need for rationalization.
106. Moreover, poverty programs are fragmented.
There are the 11 major anti-poverty programs, including
Samurdhi, in addition to multiple-agency programs that
split the already small amount available for welfare programs. Programs rely on manual registration and identification, and lack a capability to actively search for excluded
individuals. They also employ varying eligibility requirements and administrative structures, and lack modern
information management systems that would allow for
harmonization among programs.

III. Addressing the Fiscal Challenge

107. Pressures on the healthcare system and the social protection system are expected to grow with an
aging population. The proportion of the country’s working age population (defined as ages 15 to 59 in Sri Lanka) reached its peak in 2006 and the overall population is
expected to peak in 2016 (Figure 3.12). The child population (up to age 14) declined from 35 percent in 1981 to 23
percent in 2011, while the number of people aged 60 and
above is expected to double in 2041 relative to 2011. Sri
Lanka is in the midst of its demographic dividend at present and hence there is urgency to “get rich before getting
old.” While this fiscal burden may continue to be mitigated
by the limited coverage of pension schemes to public-sector workers, Sri Lanka can expect to need to develop programs for social protection of the elderly. Furthermore, the
40 percent increase in the number of civil servants over the
past 10 years, discussed below, will substantially increase
the number of pensioners under the current system (see
Chapter VI for a detailed discussion of fiscal issues associated with an aging population).

E. Large Public Sector
108. Despite its small fiscal footprint and relative
state effectiveness,30 Sri Lanka’s public sector is large.
With over one million employees, public-service employment exclusive of semi-public
entities, accounts for about
Public-service 13 percent of the labor force.
employment Although cross-country comare difficult owing
accounts for 13 parisons
to different definitions of the
percent of the labor public service, the size of the
force, close to OECD public sector in Sri Lanka is
higher than comparable publevels lic services in Thailand (roughly 9 percent) and close to
OECD levels (average of 15 percent in 2011). There have
been also small but steady increases in semi-governmental organizations such as SOEs employment over the past
10 years, comprising a further 239,000 employees in 2013.
109. Human resource management of the public service is complex with limited controls on the expansion
of the civil service. Public servants are either recruited to
one of 28 island, combined and other services (categories
of employees) or are hired in terms of respective service
minutes and individual schemes of recruitment of specific
departments or other agencies. The complement of staff
recruited through either route is proposed by the department/agency and approved by the Department of Management Services (DMS) in the Ministry of Finance (MoF).
Analysis regarding overall staffing needs is therefore effectively carried out only by the agency in question. While
the MoF through its DMS plays an oversight role, decisions
are made on a case-by-case basis without a holistic view of
managing the size of the overall civil service. Politically important ministries have demonstrated ability to increase
their staffing complement in recent years. Hiring per the
approved cadre schedules is then carried out via the Public
Service Commission (PSC) on the basis of examinations.
110. There is also fragmented control of remuneration. Wage reforms in 2006 led to the consolidation of
over 100 various positions to 37 grades and corresponding
salaries, which have been occasionally increased by the
Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) upon recommendation of the National Pay Commission appointed by the
president. There is also an extensive system of allowances
that, in terms of aggregate spending, have been roughly

Corruption according to World Governance Indicators has been consistently higher than South Asian and LMIC averages over the past 10 years.

equivalent to the formal wage bill over the past five years.
All public servants (and pensioners who receive 50 percent of the benefit) receive a cost-of- living allowance that
has increased from 1,000 rupees in 2006 to a commitment
of 10,000 rupees in 2015. Outside of cost-of-living allowances, there is a wide range of additional allowances and
incentive payments that vary for different services and
individual schemes of recruitment. The type, criteria for
receipt,and the quantum of allowances are approved by
the MPA’s director general of establishment. For instance,
preliminary medical officers may receive a base monthly
wage of 26,000 rupees per their grade, but seven additional allowances account for an additional 105,000 rupees, as
well as the right to earn more through private practice in
the evening. Thus, the complement of staff is approved by
the DMS, wages are set by the National Pay Commission
and a varied system of allowances is set by the MPA’s Establishment Department.
111. Political governments have substantially influenced the size and operation of the public service.
The government from 2005 to 2014 explicitly sought to
increase public-sector employment, particularly with recent graduates through the Yovun Diriya and other programs.31 Particularly large recruitments were carried out
in 2005 and 2012. While recruitment is carried out by an
objective process of examination, the higher echelons of
public service have been subject to influence by political
governments. Since the 1972 Constitution, all ministry secretaries have been directly appointed and removed by the
president. This has led to a small number of high-profile
appointments of people without prior civil service experience. It has also meant that with every change of government, secretaries cease to hold their positions (and are
often reassigned to another agency). Other transfers and
promotions fall under the PSC, which, in turn, has served
at the pleasure of the president for almost all of the past
30 years. This framework is conducive to senior officers developing strong political affiliations.32 New constitutional
amendments are expected to provide for more autonomy
of the civil service through a more independent PSC.

F. Improving Public Expenditure
Management
112. There are additional ways to address the fiscal
challenge through further improvements in a generally sound system of public expenditure management.
A 2013 PEFA assessment noted relative strengths in terms

31

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity

51

of budget process, quality of annual financial statements,
legislative scrutiny, and timeliness and quality of follow up
on audit findings. At the same time, Sri Lanka scores below LMIC averages on several PEFA indicators including: (i)
monitoring and reducing payment arrears; (ii) oversight on
aggregate fiscal risk; (iii) public access to key fiscal information; (iv) tax payer registration and tax collections; (v)
internal audit and payroll controls; (vi) procurement procedures and transparency; and (vii) predictability in the
availability of funds.
113. Budget planning and execution practices can
have an adverse effect on sector planning and performance. There is limited linkage between long-term financing frameworks and sector plans, with the latter effectively
lacking cost estimates. During annual budget preparation,
ceilings provided by the MoF
Budget adjustments are often late and do not

rationing which follow an activity-based expenditure classification that
leads to ad hoc is not compatible with the
prioritization of administrative and functionclassification used for budexpenditures al
geting and financial reporting. These budget practices
lead to an input-oriented culture that focuses on “spending the budget” with little reward for achieving outputs or
outcomes. At the same time, due to chronic shortfalls in
actual revenues, budget adjustments are effectively carried out through cash rationing by the Treasury vis-à-vis
ministries and other agencies. This leads to ad hoc prioritization of non-discretionary expenditures, such as salaries,
to the detriment of other priority items. While Sri Lanka’s
government has nonetheless functioned relatively well
under these circumstances, sector performance suffers as
a consequence.
114. Public investment planning is further impacted
by capacity and procedural issues. Capacity could be
strengthened to raise the effectiveness and efficiency of
public investments. A key issue is the limited capacity to
assess the planned effectiveness of investments in order
to prioritize among various needs. Efficiency depends on
the quality of planning and life-cycle costing prepared by
respective sector ministries or departments. The Department of National Planning must approve the investments,
but it lacks engineers, quantity surveyors or other technical specialists to check assumptions and estimates. Recurrent cost requirements linked to investments are rarely
factored into the assessment.

III. Addressing the Fiscal Challenge

115. A weak procurement environment remains a
concern, though reforms are imminent. Public procurement expenditure in Sri Lanka is approximately
equivalent to 21 percent of total government spending
in 2013, making up over half of total discretionary expenditures. Despite its importance, there are a number of
institutional issues that undermine efficient procurement.
In particular, there is no dedicated oversight and support
agency after the abolition of the independent National Procurement Agency in January 2008 and the transfer
of its functions to the MoF’s Public Finance Department.
Although the government has procurement guidelines,
manuals and standard documents, there is inconsistency internally and in execution. There is no independent
complaints review mechanism for public procurement.
Finally, Sri Lanka is yet to take steps to introduce electronic government procurement, which in other countries in
the region and beyond has made public procurement
more economic, efficient and transparent. Within this fluid
institutional context, the government has on several occasions made high-profile procurements on the basis of
unsolicited bids, leading to allegations of cost inflation.33
These issues are expected to be addressed through a new
national Procurement Commission mandated by the 19th
Constitutional Amendment, as well as through the passage of revised and consolidated financial regulations on
procurement.
116. Governance within public expenditure management could be strengthened through greater transparency and accountability. There are several areas where
more openness about the use of public money would be
welcome, including: budget execution reports with greater
frequency than the present bi-annual reports; information
about contract awards and associated terms; information
about resources availability to individual primary service
units (e.g. schools); and presentation of audit findings.
Providing for greater public awareness and understanding of the public sector’s use of resources would enhance
accountability. Efforts towards this objective could include
making budgeting and financial information more easily
understood by non-financial specialists as well as providing public access to proceedings of parliamentary committees on public accounts and public enterprises.

33 In some cases forgoing competition was due to conditions of external financing for projects. There have been allegations of inflated cost
to the government. See, for instance, Kumarage, Amal, “Road Building or
Rip-Off?” Sunday Times, December 21, 2014.

G. Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability
117. Fiscal sustainability analysis suggests high risks
to slower than projected growth, higher primary deficits, or higher borrowing costs. Public debt, hovering
around 106 percent of GDP in 2002, was reduced to 75.5
percent of GDP by 2014 -- reflecting relatively low borrowing costs and strong growth, supported by gradually
improving primary balance. However, fiscal sustainability
analysis carried out in 2014 highlighted some important
risks. First, slower-than-projected growth (alone or combined with a higher primary deficit and higher borrowing costs) could stop or reverse the decline in debt ratio.34
Moreover, the relatively high share of foreign currency-denominated debt (at 42 percent of the total as of 2014) also
creates a vulnerability to currency depreciation. Sri Lanka’s
public debt was 614 percent of total government revenue
and grants at end 2014, highlighting the fact that a moderate increase in borrowing costs could eat up a large share
of revenues.
118. A slowdown in growth or adverse shock may reverse the downward trend in public debt to GDP. The
reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio has been largely
due to fast GDP growth and low average real interest rates
on debt in the backdrop of a relatively stable currency. If
growth slows, a sudden fiscal adjustment might be needed to contain the debt level. The low level of fiscal revenue, the still high level of public debt and persistent fiscal
deficits leave little room for counter-cyclical fiscal policy.
Government guarantees given to state-owned and private
establishments have risen fast from 1.6 percent to 5.7 percent of GDP between 2006 and 2014, and could pose a risk
to the fiscal position.
119. The fiscal deficit could expand in 2015, requiring
long-term revenue measures to ensure sustainability going forward. The new government presented its
budget for 2015 to the Parliament in January 2015. An
extension to the budget presented by the previous government for 2015 in October 2014,35 it includes the fiscal costs pertaining to the promises made by the losing
candidate who was then in power as well as those of the
winning candidate. The result has been a change in the
composition of expenditures toward recurrent spending
due to: increases in public-servant salaries; new and expanded subsidies, including a reduction of prices of fuel
and essential goods through lower taxes and benefits to

selected niches of the society; and reduction of fuel excise
taxes for 2015 and beyond. The related costs were expected to be financed by one-time taxes36 and lower public investment. However it is yet unclear whether the narrowed
deficit target of around 5 percent of GDP set for 2015 can
be achieved. Over the medium term, the government
plans to massively increase expenditures on education
and health from their present low levels. Since revenue will
drop in 2016 once the one-time measures expire, reducing public debt to maintain fiscal sustainability and honor medium-term commitments will require increasing tax
revenue collection through permanent measures sooner
rather than later.

H. Priorities in Addressing the Fiscal
Challenge
120. Continued strong commitment to fiscal sustainability will require long-term domestic revenue mobilization efforts. Honoring medium-term commitments
while reducing the fiscal deficit and public debt will require increasing tax revenue collection through permanent measures beyond 2015.
121. Simplify the tax regime and improving tax administration. Sri Lanka has extremely low and declining
revenues driven by a complex tax regime and poor tax
administration. Low revenues and rigidity in expenditures
is causing the country to undercut investment in human
development just when its transition to a MIC poses new
challenges.
122. Improve the adequacy and effectiveness of
spending. Low levels of public spending on health, education and social protection undercut Sri Lanka’s past
strong gains in human development and leave it less well
equipped to face changing human development needs
as a MIC. Sri Lanka will also need to finance infrastructure
needs to keep pace with urbanization, the need for cost-effective power, and other infrastructure. Beyond increasing
fiscal space for these priority projects, there is need to improve efficiency of spending, towards improved targeting
of benefits, including those recently approved in 2015.

36 The most significant being a super gains tax (a 25 percent retroactive
tax imposed on individuals or corporates who generated profits over LKR
2.0 Billion in 2013/14). In addition the measures include collection of tax
arrears (by offering credit to those who have left tax payments in arrears
at concessional interest rates from the banking sector) and levies/taxes
on selected entities such as the Sri Lanka Tea Board and Telecom Regulatory Commission.

123. Improve the efficiency of spending on social
protection and public-sector personnel management
that undermine the effectiveness of the state. Reducing fragmentation and improving targeting of the existing
social protection system can ensure that every dollar spent

on social protection has a maximum impact in reducing
poverty. Similarly, improving controls on public-sector remuneration and reducing political influence in civil service
management could substantially improve the efficiency of
public service delivery.

A. Ample Opportunities for Success
124. Sri Lanka has a number of advantages that provide ample opportunities for further development.
Notwithstanding ongoing challenges, the country boasts
overall strong human capital and a reliable infrastructure
base, particularly when compared to other South Asian
countries. It has ended its internal armed conflict with
signs of an emerging long-lasting settlement to address
grievances that fed the conflict. Although it is still too early
to judge their impact, governance reforms initiated should
bring about more accountability and hence more responsive and effective government. Coupled with a demonstrably democratic system, this should strengthen further
public confidence in government and hence stability.
125. Sri Lanka enjoys an enviable location in a
fast-growing region. Proximity to growing regional economies – at its closest point Sri Lanka is only 26 kilometers
across the Palk Strait from India – provides major opportunities. Sri Lanka currently has bilateral trade agreements
with both India (ISFTA) and Pakistan (PSFTA), the two largest economies in South Asia. It also has two regional trade
agreements – one with the South Asian region (SAFTA)
and the other with wider Asia (APTA), and a trade in goods
agreement in negotiation with China. Proximity to India,
with its estimated 250 million middle-class consumer population by 2016 – over 20 times Sri Lanka’s own domestic
market – offer a large export market for Sri Lankan producers. Already in the first 14 years of the ISFTA, exports to India have grown by 1,000 percent, and the number of product lines exported to India has grown fivefold (increasingly
in higher value products). India has become Sri Lanka’s
third largest export market, behind the United Kingdom
and the United States. There are also extensive opportunities for developing trade in electricity with India.

126. It is also located along a major trade route, opening opportunities to serve as a regional trading hub.
Less than 20 kilometers off its shores is the main East-West
Indian Ocean shipping line, connecting East Asia to West
Asia, Africa, and Europe. New investments in the country’s
port infrastructure – the new Colombo (South) Port extension and the Hambantota Port – have enhanced capacity
for handling ship-based trade. The former has increased Sri
Lanka’s container handling capacity by 50 percent, making Colombo the 27th busiest port in the world, handling
about one-third as many containers as Dubai and onesixth as many containers as Singapore in 2013 (Containerization International Yearbook 2013). The latter has made
Sri Lanka an important transshipment hub for the Indian
car market, with around 15,000 vehicles being handled
each month. The Hambantota Port is being geared as an
industrial port (unlike the transshipment-only port at Colombo). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s Katunayake airport continues to be a key passenger and cargo-handling destination
in South Asia and the national airline is a leading carrier
of passengers into the Indian sub-continent. The success
of the new airport at Mattala remains in doubt, but the
facility affords an opportunity for investments in cargo/
air-freight handling and aircraft Maintenance Repair and
Overhaul services. The close proximity of the airport to the
seaport, together with the nearby industrial park, could
make Hambantota a successful trading hub for South Asia
(similar to Penang Export Hub in Malaysia), with the right
investment promotion strategies.
127. Sri Lanka’s boasts unique natural assets, with a
temperate climate, diverse topography, and rich biodiversity. Sri Lanka has a fertile land providing for agriculture, plentiful water resources and extensive stocks of fish
in its maritime waters. Its topographical variation and location as an island near the Asian mainland has led to rich
biodiversity, making it one of the world’s 35 biodiversity
‘hotspots’ (Conservation International). It boasts UNESCO’s

natural World Heritage Sites and offers the unique
opportunity to see in one day the ‘Big Four’ mammals – leopard, bear, elephant, and whale. There is
considerable potential for the development of nature-based tourism. It has a high rate of endemism
of flora and fauna and great genetic diversity of agricultural crops, with 3,000 varieties of rice having
been recorded as well as a large variety of coarse
grains, legumes, vegetables, spice crops, roots and
tubers. It is renowned for its tea, coconut, and cinnamon. The country has significant potential for
the export of high-value agricultural products.

Box 4.1 Tourism on the rise but constrained by capacity
The sector that picked up the fastest following the end of the war was tourism, with the country receiving global acclaim as a leading tourist
nation. The unique product offering owing to the diverse attractions in a compact area gives Sri Lanka an edge over many other Asian
destinations. New tourist hotels have been one of the most robust sectors for increased private investment after the conflict ended. Global
chains like Shangri-La Group (Hong Kong SAR, China/Singapore), India’s upscale ITC Group, Thailand’s Minor Group and Banyan Tree, Spain’s
RIU Hotels & Resorts, Singapore’s Aman Resorts and Mustafa Group have begun investing in the country. In addition, international brands
such as Sheraton, Marriott, Hyatt, Movenpick and Onyx have signed management agreements with local hotel companies. Locally, several
of the domestic conglomerates, including Jetwing, John Keells, Aitken Spence, Hemas, Citrus and Dilmah have expanded their tourism
investments. These new additions and upgrades are increasing both the supply and quality of medium- and high-end accommodation that
is needed for continued growth. However, the growth of the sector could be severely hampered by inadequate capacity. It is projected that
an additional 30,000 new rooms are required across Sri Lanka to cope with growing demand. The tourism industry would need to invest in
different segments of new accommodation to meet different tourist needs – from city hotels, large resorts, high-end boutique hotels and
villas, as well as tented camps and rural bungalows. Alongside this, 50,000-60,000 new hospitality staff needs to be trained to support just
the growth in room inventory. Sri Lanka currently has the capacity to train only around 1,800 new graduates each year. At the same time, the
tourism sector requires professionals in other disciplines, such as marketing, IT and sports/recreational training. Additionally, Sri Lanka would
need to develop new destinations across the country (particularly in under-developed locations with natural assets in the North and East), and
diversify the product offering in order to cater to a wider variety of tourist needs, while remaining conscious of the environmental and social
pressures brought on by rising tourist numbers.

(Exports + imports as a percent of GDP)

130. For Sri Lanka to capitalize on its location, human and physical assets, and demonstrated
capacity to develop globally competitive firms, it will
need to find an effective balance along two axes: (i) inward vs. outward orientation of the economy; and (ii)
the respective roles of the public and private sectors.
The story of Sri Lanka’s economic development over the
past 30 years has been dominated by the country’s movement along these two dimensions (Figure 4.2). In the past
decade, policies have moved the country towards a more
inward-looking, public sector-dominated model. This model of growth led by domestic
consumption, and to a lesser

involve recalibrating its economic orientation and the role

Although initially facilitated by government
liberalization policies in the late 1970s and
the 1990s, respectively, these companies have
proven resilient to changing conditions. The
apparel industry has moved from a commodity exports model to successfully targeting
niche markets for higher-value added production. The IT sector has also grown, with Sri Lanka most recently ranked 16th as a destination

defense industry, and technology product
design (software and hardware integrated engineering).

that Sri Lanka is less competitive on measures that
reflect openness and the quality of government intervention. The GCI points to particular weaknesses in terms
of property rights, favoritism in government policy, and labor legislation. The Index’s scores for most indicators (and
all indicators in the Figure 4.3) are based on assessments
of business executives familiar with Sri Lanka and, as such,
provide an independent qualitative assessment of the
strengths and weaknesses of the business environment.38

B. Inward versus Outward
Orientation of Economic Activity
132. Sri Lanka is smaller and less open today than it
was for most of the last 30 years. Before 1977, Sri Lanka’s development strategy, based on import substitution,
aimed to create a comprehensive welfare state. Post-1977,
reforms aimed to liberalize the foreign trade regime and
Sri Lanka was seen as the first country in South Asia to
significantly open its borders to trade and foreign direct
investment. In the decades that followed, trade of goods
and services increased to 89 percent of GDP in 2000, with
tea and high-end apparel exports leading the way. After
the beginning of the new millennium, however, trade
steadily declined to 54 percent of GDP in 2013. FDI remains
at below 2 percent of GDP five years after the end of armed

Sri Lanka’s exports of manufactured
goods per capita are only one-third

4.4A). Not much more than one-tenth
of the exports are for skill- and capital-intensive production with the
rest being low-added value skills and

nomic potential of Sri Lanka’s relatively educated labor
force. Additionally, the export product categories have
remained largely the same over two decades (Figure 4.5).
134. What explains the inward orientation and lack of
diversification? This section aims to unpack the reasons
for the relatively slow growth in exports and lack of dynamism in the emergence of new economic sectors. In addition to trade and industrial policies and regulatory hurdles,
the focus will be on the barriers to attracting FDI, the availability of skills for a competitive economy, and innovation
policies that promote diversification.

Trade and Industrial Policies
135. Sri Lanka’s export production basket is still a
reflection of the outward-oriented economic policies
adopted in the years following the two waves of liberalization – first in 1977-79 and then in 1990-92. The
government created Export Processing Zones (EPZs) – in-

60

dustrial parks with preferential tax treatment and specific
regulatory conditions aimed at attracting manufacturing
FDI. Originally adopted as a policy objective in 1978, EPZs
took on greater prominence during the second phase of
reform in the 1990s, with the establishment of the BOI, and
continued to be used as a strategy to encourage FDI and
boost manufacturing exports. The government extended
incentives to industry to set up in EPZs, provided special
customs facilitation, duty-free imports of intermediate inputs and equipment, tax exemptions and preferential tax
rates, streamlined administration, and subsidized utilities.
A parallel policy objective during this time was the industrialization of rural communities (targeting employment
for rural youth) and the expansion of the apparel industry
through the implementation of the 200 Garment Factories
Program. This was aimed at both domestic and foreign
investors, inside and outside the EPZs. Much of the early
investment into the EPZs was by foreign firms and concentrated in the garments sector, taking advantage of the
Multi Fiber Agreement quota for garment exports to EU

markets. This then explains part of the structural transformation described in Chapter II: whereas foreign export-oriented manufacturing firms accounted for only 24 percent
of the total in 1977, they accounted for around 80 percent
of all manufacturing exports in the 1990s. Firms with an
agreement with the BOI accounted for half of manufacturing exports by the 1990s. The establishment of manufacturing export firms attracted international buying groups
with links to these foreign firms, establishing local offices
in Sri Lanka.

a strong focus on export orientation and FDI promotion. These reform rounds were accompanied by incentives to promote exports, including a
favorable special tax regime and favorable operating environments with easier customs facilitation and import duty
cuts. But in the last decade (since the mid-2000s), there
has been a noticeable slide towards protectionism and industrial policy has focused more on promoting domestic
enterprises.39

39 Kaminski B and Ng F (2013) ‘Increase in Protectionism and its Impact
on Sri Lanka’s Performance in Global Markets’, World Bank, p3.

137.
There has been an increase in para-tariffs in the past decade. This has not only significantly increased nominal protection and prices
of imports, but has also added to trade policy
complexity. The combined system of the Most Favored Nation applied tariff rate and the para-tariffs
has made the present import regime one of the
most complex and protectionist in the world.40 Implementing para-tariffs has effectively doubled the
protection rates to 24 percent (Figure 4.6). Worse
still is the para-tariffs’ dispersion, which leads to
prices that distort production and consumption
patterns. Last, higher rates of protection on final
products than on inputs used in their production
lead to high effective protection rates and anti-export bias, because producers have strong incentive to sell goods domestically even though their
domestic costs are higher than their opportunity
costs through trade. This is particularly worrying in
the case of the agricultural sector, given that a large
share of the bottom 40 percent of the population
continues to be agricultural producers. Trade barriers also
make it more difficult for local producers to access inputs,
reducing their competitiveness and ability to integrate in
global value chains. Firms are also less likely to invest in
capital equipment that would raise productivity and promote technology transfers.
138. Stagnating product diversification and weak export performance has come on the back of an industrial policy orientation in the past decade that does not
promote competition and aims to protect domestic industry. Although successive governments after 1977 carried out ad hoc import substitution policies, these did not
have a significant aggregate impact on trade policy. The
decade since 2005 has seen the most extensive measures
were adopted, where the focus noticeably tilted towards
promotion of domestic agriculture (with generous subsidies and guaranteed prices), domestic industries (with
specific tax breaks and tariff protection), and wide-scale
public infrastructure programs (particularly connective infrastructure like highways and ports).
139. The government has been interventionist, “tilting the playing field” in many areas through a web of
tax and trade policy incentives for a large number of
domestic sectors and actors. As noted in Chapter II, there
are now over 500 VAT exemptions for various industries
and actors and 48 various types of income-tax holidays,
many of which are quite expansive (such as “new undertakings in less developed areas”). Many of the incentives
appear to benefit a specific, small set of firms. For instance,

40

Pursell 2011a,b

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity

|

61

in 2012, the government announced fiscal measures to
support import substitution industries in cement, pharmaceuticals, steel, fabric and milk powder. Without any wide
scale existing local entrepreneurship in these sectors to
take advantage of these concessions, it was apparent that
such measures were targeted to benefit a handful of firms.
140. FDI has also been promoted through incentives
for specific investors provided through BOI and under
the Strategic Development Projects (SDP) Act, giving
government a large, direct role. The SDP Act in particular provides fast-track approvals, exemptions from a range
of income and border taxes, and special treatment on
land ownership. The act allows for negotiation of individual deals and the eligibility of projects are discretionary;
whether a project is strategic in nature can be left to interpretation by the subject minister, so long as it is in a sector
that is specified in the act. Many of the 13 SDPs that have
been approved have been unsolicited proposals. There is
little reporting on their terms, particularly tax benefits and
the terms for use of land, nor is it possible to determine fiscal impacts by available budget data. The upshot of these
regimes is that prospective investors have a strong incentive to negotiate with government to secure privileges.
This is particularly the case with SDPs where terms are decided on a case-by-case basis; BOI incentives are uniform
for all investors.
141. The government has also made attempts to encourage greater domestic value-addition of manufactured exports as well as commodity exports. This was
done by introducing high taxes (called ‘cesses’) on exports
in “raw form” as determined by the government. The taxes
are primarily imposed on exports of tea, rubber, cinnamon,
coconut and spices. Revenues from cesses are supposed
to be then invested in R&D for the corresponding sectors
again to encourage value addition. It is yet to be seen
whether this has had any significant impact on boosting
value-added exports of primary commodities. These policy measures would need to be accompanied by steps to
increase competitiveness and innovation of firms in these
sectors to truly be able to move up the value chain. The
falling prices of key commodities – like natural rubber (due
to the global expansion of synthetic rubber) – have also
hurt the ability of traditional firms to finance industrial upgrading in line with government policy directions.
142. Inward orientation and lack of diversification are
reflected in the structural characteristics of Sri Lanka’s
agriculture sector. Although, agriculture has contributed
about one-third to Sri Lanka’s poverty reduction over the
past decade (Chapter II), the sector has remained in a low
productivity equilibrium including the plantation (tea, coconut, rubber) and field crops sectors. Achieving self-sufficiency in rice has been a success but has also meant that

62

|

IV. Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

Sri Lanka’s agriculture production structure has remained
concentrated in the basic and relatively low-value food
crop. In 2013, about 66 percent of the cultivated area was
under rice cultivation but the share of rice in the overall
value of crop production was only about 20 percent. Despite growing domestic demand and potential for export
growth, higher-valued crops, in particular fruits and vegetables have not expanded, while growing demand has
been met by increased imports of, for example, dairy products, potatoes, onions and maize.
143. A recent EU ban on Sri Lankan fish exports further limits export potential in a sector that is important for the bottom 40 percent. In February 2015, the EU
imposed a ban on fish imports from Sri Lanka over concerns on Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated fishing. The EU
is the main destination of fish exports of Sri Lanka, with
about 42 percent of fish exports being shipped to the EU
in 2013. The fisheries sector employs an estimated one million citizens, contributing over 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014.
Much of the population involved in this sector is located in
the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Recent analysis using
a Computable General Equilibrium model found that the
overall effect of the ban on Sri Lankan fish could cause a
decline in Sri Lanka’s GDP growth rate by 0.01 percentage
points and a 3 percent increase in poverty from 6.74 to
6.94 percent.41 Although the ban is on the fishing sector,
unskilled workers in agriculture and other sectors are likely to be the most adversely affected due to inter-sectoral
linkages and because of increased competition with workers who lose their fishing jobs.
144. Sri Lanka’s new policy makers will need to review and revise the country’s trade-related policies in
order to promote economic diversification and shared
growth. The links between growth performance and specific trade policies are ambiguous and depend on many
endogenous and exogenous factors such as factor endowments, geographical location, demography, etc. Each policy comes with its own set of challenges. For example, import substitution laid the foundation for industrialization
in Brazil but at some point led the economy to collapse
under the weight of accumulated inefficiencies. Some
East Asian countries (e.g. Japan, South Korea) caught up
with developed economies while keeping multinational
corporations and FDI largely out of the country whereas
others (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand) actively sought
to attract foreign investors and benefited from positive
spillovers. In the case of Sri Lanka, moving from growth fueled by reconstruction and infrastructure towards growth
based on a diversified and competitive economy will likely
require a rethinking of the policies in place and their suit-

ability as foundations for the economy of the future.

Attracting and Retaining Efficiency-Enhancing
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
145. FDI is needed as a foundation for economic diversification, but Sri Lanka’s performance has been
disappointing. In addition to boosting investment necessary for growth and providing long-term balance of payments financing, FDI can help enhance the sophistication
of Sri Lankan products and exports through introduction
of new technologies and production processes. It can also
give rise to positive spillovers through improvement
Levels of FDI have
of skills and introduction of
been disappointing
new management practices. Finally, FDI can enhance
access of Sri Lankan producers to global production networks and facilitate the development of new activities
within existing value chains (increasing value added in
production). However, FDI in Sri Lanka has been lower
than in peer countries in spite of Sri Lanka’s comparative
advantages, such as its location and access to major markets (Figure 4.7).

146. Not all FDI has the same potential for positive
spillovers to the economy. FDI inflows to Sri Lanka have
been largely focused on infrastructure (inclusive of real
estate development), with a relatively small proportion
reaching sectors of the economy that are associated with
global networks of production (Figure 4.7B). There are
broadly three types of FDI: (i) natural-resource-seeking; (ii)
market-seeking; and (iii) efficiency-seeking. When considering investment policy, it is critical to acknowledge that
the factors that motivate, dissuade and impact investors
are vastly different depending on the business they are
in, and the markets they target. The basic motivations of
an investor provide an insight into the socio-economic impacts that the firm may have in Sri Lanka. Countries
often make the mistake of designing investment policies
around the type of foreign investments that they already
have, rather than tailoring policies to suit the type of investment that they want to grow. In that regard, it is important for authorities to identify those types ofinvestors
that are more likely to make a positive contribution to the
domestic economy. In turn, this identification should be
consistent with the investment policy that is developed
for the country.

Box 4.2 Global experience in attracting and retaining FDI: infrastructure and incentives are not major factors
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency conducted a Global Investment and Political Risk survey of investors in 2013 to identify
the main factors that inform the selection of investment destinations. Global investors seek macroeconomic and political stability in the
host country as a foundation. Beyond that, the availability of qualified staff is the most important decision element, and one that has
grown rapidly in relevance over the past few years. Other factors, such as the availability of infrastructure, have substantially decreased
in importance when investors select locations. Notably, while the size of the domestic market used to be a major decision factor, it has
become less important owing to shifting interest towards efficiency and linkages to global markets. The views of global investors offer
insights that can be used to determine the priorities for policies and investments aimed at attracting and retaining FDI. They also highlight
the fact that bringing FDI to Sri Lanka will require much more than investment in infrastructure and incentives to investors. Research on
other countries has demonstrated that: (i) incentives alone can be insufficient to attract efficiency-enhancing FDI; (ii) retention of FDI is
low as incentives pose a significant fiscal strain and investors often switch investment destinations when incentives dry up; and (iii) fixing
enabling-environment deficiencies can be more effective than offering incentives to cover for such deficiencies.
Sri Lanka may consider other factors to attract investment, including:
• Minimizing uncertainty and fostering investor confidence through certainty on policies and regulations.
• Eliminating unnecessary regulatory and policy obstacles to FDI.
• Investing in education to ensure that the population (and especially the youth) has the skills demanded by efficiency-enhancing
enterprises (see below).
• Establishing a level playing field that fosters competition and eliminates preferential treatment for specific public or private players.
• Developing a well-functioning financial sector that can actively contribute to the development of local firms that can be part of the
ecosystem around foreign enterprises.
Minimizing uncertainty and fostering investor confidence. Governments have a major role in building investor confidence through
ensuring predictability and consistency in regulations that govern the activities of foreign investors, as well as protecting investor rights
and ownership. Arguably, this confidence is particularly important in attracting efficiency-seeking investors, whose business model depend
on productivity and reliability of production (which can be easily disrupted by regulatory changes), rather than on cheap access to natural
resources. Recent actions including the appropriation of 37 “underutilized” assets, as well as the proposed/upcoming changes to land
laws, significantly undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Sri Lanka, and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment

destination in favor of jurisdictions that can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors.
Investment entry barriers include both (de jure) rule-based, legal barriers and (de facto) factual barriers that arise on the ground. Although
most countries in the world seek to attract foreign investment, very few countries maintain an entirely open investment regime. Some
limitations may intentionally discriminate against foreign firms, such as when a country closes a sector for security or cultural reasons, or
protects a domestic industry. Other limitations may arise as a substitute for regulation, or because of institutional dynamics and inefficiencies.
In addition to policy obstacles, there are procedural barriers, including documentation requirements, as well as de facto barriers such as
lack of enforcement or excessive discretion on the part of public officials. Research conducted on OECD countries, estimated FDI increases
after the removal of specific restrictions (Table B1). While these figures may not necessarily reflect the situation in Sri Lanka, they highlight
the potential of reforms in enhancing the attractiveness of a country as an investment destination. In the case of Sri Lanka, the World Bank
has not undertaken a formal assessment of specific barriers. Such analysis would help in order to identify the current obstacles that may be
further reducing the attractiveness of the country as an investment destination.

147. Using incentives may not be an effective tool to
attract efficiency-enhancing FDI to Sri Lanka. Investment incentives can be used to compete for potential
investors; to encourage certain business practices; and to
attract investment into priority regions and priority sectors. However, evidence from both survey and econometric studies indicate that the key determinants affecting an
investor’s decision on where to locate are often based on
broad economic and investment climate factors such as
market size, regulatory policies, natural resource endowments, infrastructure, and human capital availability (Box
4.2).42 Investment incentives, therefore, tend to be most
relevant at the margins of investor decision-making; they
are likely to be most influential when investors are wavering between similar options, and when a country already
has a favorable investment climate. As Sri Lanka seeks to
enhance the attraction and retention of FDI with positive

42 While many countries have sought to attract FDI through offering
incentives to investors, research has demonstrated that a) incentives
alone can be insufficient to attract efficiency-enhancing FDI, b) retention
of FDI is low as incentives pose a significant fiscal strain and investors often switch investment destinations when incentives dry up, and c) fixing
enabling environment deficiencies can be more effective than offering
incentives to cover for such deficiencies.

transformative potential, it should analyze the effectiveness and adequacy of incentives together with the costs
involved in fiscal losses and potential disruption of market
dynamics (through, inter alia, the creation of an unleveled
playing field).

Ensuring Human Capital and Skills for
Competitiveness
148. The challenges of competing in the global economy require not only high human capital and advanced
skills but also a workforce that can adjust to shifts in
domestic and global demand. Education and training
are fundamental for a competitive economy, especially for
the production of high-value-added goods and services.43
International evidence shows that skills are key to improving the welfare of individuals and ensuring that the private
sector can innovate and adjust to greater global competition, master processes that will increase productivity, and
attract and retain FDI.

Despite the past positive achievements, the quality
of general education lags that
of many higher middle-income

education, as measured by annual
national assessments of learning
outcomes and periodic internationally comparable tests, lags that
of several higher middle-income countries, particularly in
language and numeracy skills (Figure 4.9A).44 In particular,

those who have completed O-levels has increased from 30

and among students from the types of schools attended

and 38 percent said the same about retaining low-skilled
workers.

151. Moreover, Sri Lanka has a shortage of adequate
vocational and technical skills in its workforce, skills
that are increasingly in demand. Although there is an
increasing demand for mid-level technicians, in particular
in the services sector, and low-skilled workers in manufacturing, only 16 percent of workers have completed technical and vocational education and training (TVET), and
only 73 percent of those have acquired few, if any, job-relevant skills (Figure 4.10). Just 16 percent of workers know
how to use a computer and 24 percent have proficiency in
English. Aptitude for these skills is lowest in the rural and
low-skilled parts of the population. Many existing training
programs in the TVET sector suffer from low quality and
a lack of relevance to the skills demanded by employers.
Importantly, the links between vocational training centers
and industry are missing. In fact, 46 percent of employers
indicate that job-specific skills are the most important
factor in deciding whether to retain a high-skilled worker

153. The structure and composition of Sri Lanka’s
higher education enrollment has multiple defects.47
First, the largest share of enrollment, nearly 60 percent, is
in external degree programs (EDPs), where students are
enrolled in universities and sit examinations, but do not
follow lectures or classes, and receive no academic support
from the university. This is a low-cost option for the government to expand higher education access and coverage:
but it is at the expense of quality. The greatest proportion
of unemployed graduates is drawn from these EDPs. Second, the balance between enrollment in the public sector
and in the private sector is heavily skewed against the private sector, which has only 12 percent of enrollment. This
is due to Sri Lanka’s strongly state-centered higher education system. A major constraint to expanding private-sector participation is the absence of a clear and transparent
process for private higher education institutions to register
and obtain quality and accreditation assurances. A third
major constraint is the relatively low public investment
that has limited the expansion of the public universities,
especially in the sciences, technology and engineering. In
fact, the proportion of students enrolled in science and
engineering has actually begun to decline since 2002.48

Indeed, the composition of students in the conventional
degree programs of the universities is still dominated by
disciplines such as the liberal arts, management, commerce and law, with underrepresentation of scientific and
technical fields. A middle-income country, if it is to grow
fast, needs a higher proportion of skilled and competent
science and technical graduates. Moreover, enrollment in
employment-oriented alternative higher education institutions in the public sector is small, at only 3 percent of
total higher education enrollment. Finally, leadership and
communications skills are some of the non-cognitive abilities of white-collar workers that are most highly prized
by Sri Lankan firms. Unfortunately, many soft skills are
not learned sufficiently by Sri Lankans through the formal
education system. To compete effectively in international
markets Sri Lanka’s workforce will need to attain a higher
level of computer literacy, the ability to operate the latest
equipment, and fluency in foreign languages.49

154. The result is that Sri Lanka’s firms have difficulty
accessing the skills they need. In 2010, manufacturing
companies ranked the inadequate education of the labor
force as the third most important constraint on their operations, with only Bangladesh and Afghanistan having
higher such ratings in South Asia (Figure 4.12). Only elec-

tricity supply and tax rates were greater concerns. This is a
problem that affects firms across all sectors. If these firms
cannot find the skills that they need, they will not be able
to upgrade their processes and products to compete in a
more liberalized trade regime.

GCE A-levels, only 18 percent of the population has done
so.51 Similarly, 70 percent of employers think that an average low-skilled worker should have passed GCE O-levels,
but only 35 percent of low-skilled employees and 40 percent of the self-employed have done so. About 60 percent
of employers responding to a survey expected that an
average worker in a high-skilled occupation should have
completed technical or vocational education and training,
and 24 percent think the same about low-skilled workers.
Yet only 16 percent of the population has that qualification
(Figure 4.13). Similarly, 80 percent of employers expect a
high-skilled worker to know English and 40 percent expect
that of less-skilled workers while 75 percent of employers think an average higher-skilled worker should have
computer skills and 38 percent expect the same of lower-skilled workers. However, only 20 percent of Sri Lankans
are fluent in English and only 15 percent can use computers. The supply and demand differences are less stark in
workers who are formally employed; the informal sector
lags seriously behind.

51 Based on the employer survey high-skilled workers are those who
work as managers, professionals, technicians, and associate professionals; low-skilled workers work in clerical support, services, sales, skilled
agriculture, forestry and fishery, crafts and related trades, plant and machine operation and assembly, and low skilled occupations.

IV. Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

156. When it comes to vocational training, many
employers question the quality and relevance of education and training curricula. Employers believe that
the TVET system could be critical for providing the workers they need but feel that it does not convey up-to-date
knowledge (50 percent) or produce the kinds (54 percent)
or levels (52 percent) of skills needed (Figure 4.14A). To
compensate for skills shortages in the labor force many
employers train their own workers.
157. The returns to education have been declining.
Despite average educational attainment going up, the
premium to additional years of education has declined
over time (Figure 4.14B). This may be expected when overall average educational attainment increases without a
commensurate increase in demand, leading to a decline
in the premium from higher education. To demonstrate a
mismatch between the demand for skills and the supply
of education requires estimating returns to each type of
skill under consideration, controlling for the increase in
quantity of each such skill. However, to the extent that
companies report shortages of well-trained workers, this
decline in the returns to education is consistent with the
view that Sri Lanka’s educational system is not providing
the skills desired by the market. This problem is particularly worrisome for the youth, who often wait for years to
be admitted into university and then end up with degrees
that provide relatively low returns.

Innovation Policies
158. Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship is
essential to increase the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s
private sector. While many countries have sought to enhance innovation through direct government support in
the form of subsidies and grants, the results and effectiveness of such programs have been mixed at best. Enhancing innovation in Sri Lanka will likely require a long-term
innovation policy that fosters linkages between domestic
and foreign firms as well as between universities and R&D
institutions and the private sector in Sri Lanka. An effective
innovation policy will also eliminate costly barriers to imports of capital goods and be in line with policies aimed at
attracting efficiency-seeking FDI.
159. Different countries have adopted different innovation policies and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Sophisticated economies such as South Korea
and Singapore have promoted R&D-driven innovation,
which leads to the introduction of products and processes
that are “new to the world” (Figure 4.16). However, investment in R&D may not be efficient in absence of linkages
between R&D institutions and networks of enterprises that
can benefit from it. Economies that have yet to catch up
with more productive peers often implement policies that
seek to accelerate the absorption of existing technologies
that are “new to the country” as a way to enhance the productivity of existing industries (Table 4.1). Sri Lanka’s ex-

penditure on R&D and formal transfer of technology has
been modest compared to other emerging markets (Figure 4.16).
160. Strengthening research and development and
promoting collaboration between academia and the
private sector is critical. In the past the focus of government has largely been on income tax and VAT incentives to
boost R&D, particularly through government institutions.
However, two constraints quickly emerged: (i) the small
number of suitable government research institutions capable of catering to industry needs; and (ii) the limited
capacity in, and low-industry orientation of, government
research facilities. Raising overall public and private R&D
is important but should be done in the context of knowl-

edge institutions that effectively collaborate
with the private sector.
161. Investment in, and quality of, R&D
has been insufficient to facilitate effective
modernization of agriculture. Sri Lanka
has fallen behind in the generation of new
knowledge and technology as well as in the
distribution of new technologies that are critical for modern farming. The percentage of
the agriculture budget allocated for R&D and
extension is small compared to other Asian
nations. The majority of the country’s 23 research institutes focus on traditional sub-sectors and crops, including fisheries, rice, and
the plantation crops (tea, rubber, coconut,
sugar cane). Very little funding is allocated to
higher-value crops (vegetables, fruit, dairy)
that are critical to driving sector modernization and exports. In fact, only a small portion
of the value of export cesses – which are supposed to be the industry’s contributions to
agricultural R&D (tea, rubber, coconut mainly)
-- are given to the research institutes. These
institutions focus on physical output of commodities and less explicitly on profitability of
for its customers. At the same time, publicly
run extension services are under-resourced
and do not allow for effective diffusion of new
technologies. R&D must shift towards a more
market-driven approach as farmers diversify their farming systems by producing more
high-value crops, livestock, and related products. Sri Lanka would benefit from an overall
reorganization of its R&D and extension system, including promoting more private-sector participation.

162. Sri Lanka’s potential for innovation
and scientific discovery is highlighted by
its output of intellectual property where it lags behind some particularly dynamic countries (Figure
4.17). Countries that have moved from middle-income
to high-income status tend to show higher levels of patent generation than nations that do not make the jump,
and Sri Lanka is likely to need to follow the same path.52
Sri Lanka has an intellectual property framework in place
but it has scope for improvement.53 Beyond the legal
and regulatory framework covering intellectual property

a whole and the bottom 40 percent in particular.

Public Sector Performance as a Regulator

C. The Relationship between the
Public Sector and Private Sector
163. The relationship between the public sector and
private sector has been a critical determinant of Sri
Lanka’s development over the past few decades and
will shape its progress going forward. Global experience
points to the importance of private-sector-led growth
and government regulation to facilitate such growth. Industrial, trade, and tax policies carried out by successive
governments – many of them extremely granular in nature
-- have shaped the contours of Sri Lanka’s economy. The
government has also had a major impact on the economy
and jobs for the population through regulation of the private sector in terms of market entry and transactions, land
use, and labor practices. While all states regulate these issues, particular features of Sri Lanka’s approach have led
to specific types of constraints. Finally, the state itself is a
major participant in the market through its large SOE sector and large public service, which in turn has impacted
competitiveness in a number of sectors and labor market
dynamics. These government policies have contributed to
the emergence of a large informal sector, which further
distorts the market and undermines productivity. Addressing constraints evident in the present pattern of the state’s
interaction with the private sector – improving economic

164. The investment climate in Sri Lanka lags behind
that of regional peers and is a significant drag on competitiveness going forward. Sri Lanka has made some
important reforms over the past years that have translated
into improvements in some areas of investment climate.
However, most areas of the investment climate remain
more challenging than in other regional and LMIC comparators by several measures, including the Ease of Doing
Business indicators (Figure 4.18). Going forward, sustainable private-sector-led growth will require the ability of
the country to identify and eliminate unnecessary business environment obstacles to entrepreneurship particular to Sri Lanka. This will require more intensive public-private dialogue to involve the private sector in identification
of the most significant obstacles to their operations as a
way to prioritize reforms. At the same time, after reforms
take place on paper, their full and consistent implementation across the country is essential to ensure equal opportunities for entrepreneurs in all regions. Finally, it will be
important to assess the impact of reforms to ensure that
they have achieved the objective expected.

Regulatory Environment: Land

as a barrier to business development. Access to land

168. Finally, the predictability of state regulation
with regard to property rights has been impacted by
a few recent cases of controversial government legislation. Most notable among these was an act introduced
in late 2011 under which private-sector projects on state
land deemed by the government to be abandoned, underused or being operated outside of the scope of the
original agreements were returned to the state. The “Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized
Assets Act” expropriated 37 enterprises in sectors like hotels, mixed-property development and sugar industries.
While the government at the time stated this would be a
one-off measure, the law’s targeting of specific enterprises
and language that provided for further takings spooked
business confidence. Similarly, in 2013 the government
abruptly introduced legislation to restrict foreign ownership of land, including legal entities with foreign equity.
Consultative mechanisms for private-sector inputs on specific legislation that may affect the business climate are ad
hoc at best.

Regulatory Environment: Licenses and Permits
169. Licenses and permits are an obstacle to a greater
degree than in comparator countries, with significant
differences within the country. Almost one in five companies responding to an enterprise survey in 2011 identified licensing and permitting as a major obstacle to their
operations – as compared to close to one in 10 firms with
similar views in other countries. These investment climate
difficulties affect firms unevenly across industries and regions (Figure 4.19). While one in 10 service-sector firms

are negatively affected, almost one in three manufacturing firms are impacted. One in 100 firms in the Southern
Province suffer from these difficulties, while they hamper
almost six out of 10 firms in the Northern Province. The
uneven impact of investment climate deficiencies highlights a potential gap between the written law and its application, which could stem from discretionary behavior of
some regulatory agencies. The uneven application of laws
and regulations across regions could reinforce existing regional growth imbalances and hurt employment creation
in areas where more of the bottom 40 percent is located,
like in the Northern Province.

Regulatory Environment: Trade Facilitation
170. Sri Lanka has seen steady improvement in its
ranking on international trade facilitation indexes although its performance is still lower than the middle
income and East Asian peers with which it currently
competes. Sri Lanka’s performance on key international
trade-facilitation indices are indicative of the strides the
country has made in improving its trade facilitation in the
last five years (Figure 4.20). However current challenges
involve the stiff competition being posed by other middle-income and South East Asian countries that are vying
for a greater share of global investments. The perceptions
identified in international indices point to significant improvements that could be made to the regulatory and institutional infrastructure that currently exist in Sri Lanka.

trade transaction costs. Policy-induced barriers consist-

Regulatory Environment: Labor Market
173. Labor market regulations appear to be constraining the growth of employment. Labor market
regulations aim to provide job security to formal-sector
workers but, since these workers represent only about 15
percent of the labor force, the
Labor market regulations instead result in a
deep divide between formal
regulations slowed and informal workers. While it
employment growth is relatively easy to hire workoutside of export ers in Sri Lanka, it remains
difficult for formal firms to
production zones downsize during downturns.
Sri Lanka’s Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA) requires that firms with
15 or more employees justify layoffs and provide generous severance pay to displaced workers, with smaller firms
being exempted. Moreover, severance payments are expensive relative to regional and middle-income peers. Although formally subject to TEWA, firms in EPZs may have
been partially exempt from TEWA due to lax enforcement
in that sector. Empirical work57 has shown that TEWA restrictions retard the growth of non-EPZ firms below the
threshold of 15 workers, only atypically productive firms
pass the threshold, and once they do, they grow faster
than EPZ firms, suggesting that the TEWA failed to lower
unemployment. Instead, it slowed employment growth of
non-EPZ firms and induced firms to seek the EPZ sector in
order to evade the law.
174. In addition, the legal framework governing work
in the private sector reduces female employment. Legislation prevents women from taking up night work or
part-time work in the growing service sector.58 This not
only promotes exclusion of women from some economic
sectors, such as the growing tourism industry, but it also
reduces overall potential employment. Similarly, the laws

57

governing maternity benefits59 make employers bear the
entire cost, potentially deterring employers from hiring
women.60

Regulatory Environment: Enforcement of Contracts
175. Sri Lanka’s commercial justice system is prone
to delays, though there have been improvements in
recent years. The country’s justice system suffers from a
relatively small number of judges and corresponding high
caseloads, and lax enforcement of civil procedure, which
leads to frequent continuations and gaps in law that make
resolution of land and land inheritance disputes very difficult. Recent controversies over leadership in the judiciary and executive influence have further undermined the
sector. There is a backlog of over 25,000 civil cases lasting
more than five years (and, in some instances, more than
30 years), the vast majority of which are land and partition
(land inheritance) cases. Alternative dispute resolution has
not taken root, with the exception of community level mediation boards. However, the introduction of a specialized
commercial high court in Colombo to hear higher value
commercial cases has improved adjudication in terms of
timeliness and quality of judgments.61

Regulatory Environment and Informality
176. Regulatory compliance burdens prompt entrepreneurs to operate informally, which in turn undermines competition. Moreover, the level of informality is
much higher in some sectors (such as non-garment manufacturing, where one in three firms reportedly start operations informally and stay informal for three years on average) and in some regions of the country (notably Eastern
region where more than 60 percent of firms surveyed start
operations informally and remained informal for almost
seven years on average (Figure 4.22A). Informality affects
the ability of firms to grow and enhance productivity due,
inter alia, to limited investment, limited access to finance
and inadequate business processes.

58 The Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 states under
paragraph 10(2) that „a person who has attained the age of fourteen
years and who [...] is a female, shall not be employed in or about the business of a shop or office before 6 am or after 6pm on any day“. Exception
included in the act include: (i) women from the age of eighteen years may
be employed in or about the business of a hotel or restaurant for the period between 6pm and 10pm; (ii) women from the age of eighteen may be

59 Maternity benefits in Sri Lanka’s private sector are governed by the
Maternity Benefits Ordinance No. 32 of 1939 (for women employed in any
trade) and the Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 (for women
employed in shops and offices) (Abeykoon et al. 2014). In 1993, Sri Lanka ratified the ILO Maternity Protection Convention (Revised) 1952 (No.
103). However, there remain shortcomings between the national legislation and the ILO convention. One of the shortcomings is that maternity
benefit payments are financed through employer liability.

177. Side-by-side operations of informal and formal
firms in a market lead to unfair practices and market
inefficiencies. Unfair competition from informal players
is viewed as the single most important obstacle to the
growth and competitiveness of established firms (Figure
4.22B). Formal firms may find themselves at a disadvantage as they face higher marginal costs, such as for labor
and taxes, than informal firms. At the same time, informal
firms generally have no access to financial services, government contracts, and essential licenses and permits,
and there is local evidence that greater formalization can

and formal firms, investment in operational efficiency and
business growth.62
178. Most business establishments in Sri Lanka are
small, with profound implications for productivity. An
important obstacle to improving firm-level productivity is
the extent to which firms can take advantage of economies
of scale. The 2014 Economic Census found that 93 percent
of private economic establishments had fewer than 5 employees (Figure 4.23). Nearly 22 percent of those establishments are in manufacturing,
while 70 percent are in the
service industry, including There have been
40 percent in wholesale and overall increases in
retail trade, and 8 percent informal employment
in hotel and food services.
While the link between firm over the past decade
size and productivity is not
documented in Sri Lanka, developing-country experience
would suggest that small firms tend to be less productive. Moreover, these micro firms are younger than large
enterprises, with an average of 10 years since beginning
commercial operations against an average of 20 years for
medium and large firms. SMEs are particularly prevalent in
regions outside the Western Province.

179. The proliferation of informal employment and
small firms has important consequences for the ability
of the bottom 40 percent to share in the growth process. Most of the increase in non-agricultural employment
between 2002 and 2012 was among self-employed nonfarm workers (accounting for 48 percent of the increase).
Self-employed workers increased from 21 to 25 percent of
non-agricultural workers between 2002 and 2012, while
the share of informal-wage workers63 hovered above 30
percent of the non-farm workers (Figure 4.24A). Moreover,
the decline in agricultural employment coincided with a
sharp increase in workers employed in establishments
with no regular employees. By 2012, 37 percent of nonfarm workers were employed in establishments with no
regular employees, up from 33 percent in 2006 (Figure
4.24B).64 Similarly, by 2012, 74 percent of unskilled workers
(those with less than a primary education) had only temporary or casual wage employment, up from 70 percent
in 2006, suggesting that these workers are increasingly
working under precarious conditions. Wages of temporary
workers are on average 33 percent lower than wages of

63 Informal workers were defined as by DCS as workers in companies
not registered, those without accounts, or those with less than 10 regular
employees. This data is only available beginning in 2006.
64 Although calculations presented here exclude the Northern and
Eastern province for comparability purposes, the share of workers in
establishments with no regular employees was also 47 percent in 2012
when the North and East are included.

permanent workers; one-third of that gap cannot be explained by differences in the job or individual characteristics, suggesting that to some extent workers would choose
more stable jobs if they could.65
180. Under these circumstances, a key question is
why firms stay informal in the first place and what
can be done to encourage formalization. A standard
hypothesis has been that reducing the cost of operating
a business could reduce informality, reduce uncompetitive practices, and, by extension, create an environment
more conducive to investment in productivity-enhancing
activities. However, existing evidence indicates that lowering the costs of formalizing on businesses would have
only limited impact.66 In fact, it appears that most informal
firms will not formalize unless forced to do so via increased
enforcement, suggesting formality offers little private
benefit to informal firms. Similarly, rigorous evaluations of
business training programs show limited to no effects on
actual firm outcomes and performance.67 Even providing
business training and grants have not yet been shown to

182. For subsistence enterprises, the existing evidence seems to suggest that such firms see no benefits from formalizing, and would typically contribute
very little to taxes if they did formalize. They may still
compete with larger firms, but in the absence of other job
opportunities for these individuals, the government may
prefer to leave them alone rather than have them close
down. The only remaining public rationale for trying to
bring them into the formal sector is that the presence of
so many informal firms may send a message to the public
that obeying the law is optional, and also dissuade more
prosperous informal firms from formalizing. An alternative
approach used in some countries is to write the law in a
way that does not require informal firms with income below a certain threshold to register, putting them in compliance with the law. But unless such a threshold is set
very high, there are still likely to be many firms above the
threshold who choose not to register.

to provide much-needed alternative options to the SME
sector. In particular, accessing finance appears to be particularly difficult for smaller firms, those operating in specific
sectors (including garments and retail), and firms managed by women. For those firms, accessing credit is often
dependent on their ability to post collateral with a value of
more than 200 percent of the loan amount, a substantial
obstacle for many firms (Figure 4.25). On the other hand,
larger firms appear to have relatively easy access to loans
and much lower collateralization requirements. Although
a movable collateral registry is available, it is limited in its
operations, severely curtailing the ability of firms and entrepreneurs to use moveable collateral (e.g. machinery, inventory, accounts receivable) as security to their loans. As

181. There are several compelling reasons to try and
bring larger and more profitable informal firms into
the formal system. First, collecting taxes from relatively
well-off owners of informal firms would widen the tax base,
while the revenue collected is likely to justify the costs of
greater inspections to ensure that they do become formal. Secondly, these larger and more successful informal
firms are more likely to be the ones competing with formal
firms for customers. Ensuring that such firms also become
formal may cut back on unfair competition that prevents
more efficient formal firms from growing faster. The challenge is how to encourage formalization of such firms.
Based on the evidence described above, lowering the cost
and complexity of registration seems a necessary, but not
sufficient, step. Policymakers could also experiment with
innovative approaches to encourage suppliers or customers to demand formality. One such example being tried in
several countries is to link each tax receipt number to a lottery, so that customers have an incentive to demand a tax
receipt on each transaction. Such a system has been used
in Taiwan, China; Korea; China; and Puerto Rico. Wan (2010)
compares changes in tax revenues in districts in China that
introduced this reform to those that did not, and finds the
introduction of this tax receipt lottery increased sales tax
revenue by 17 percent.

encourage firms to formalize.68 Given this evidence, what
policies should Sri Lanka focus on?

a result, despite the high penetration of regulated financial
institutions in Sri Lanka, an estimated 64 percent of micro,
small and medium enterprises remain without checking or
savings accounts (World Bank, 2014e).
184. Access to finance is most impacted by weaknesses in the financial system and the bankability of projects, while availability of funds per se is not a problem.
Past strategies to address this challenge have relied on
directed lending and concessional credit rather than improving financial intermediation for, and bankability of,
SMEs. Sri Lanka has had numerous programs to enhance
access to finance targeting specific sectors (including nine
for agriculture, 11 for SMEs, and seven for microfinance)69,
yet SMEs continue to highlight access to finance as a major constraint. Weaknesses in intermediation include: deficiencies in Sri Lanka’s credit infrastructure (the lack of a
movable collateral registry and an incomplete credit information system); limited financial innovation (e.g. the lack
of factoring, operational leasing of equipment); limited
ability of, or incentive for, commercial banks to serve new
markets segments (lack of cash-flow-based lending practices); and deficiencies in the legal framework governing
lending activities (costly and long judiciary procedures for
foreclosure, and an outdated Secured Transactions Law)70.
The disconnect between extensive penetration of banking institutions across the island and ample liquidity with
the difficulties that SMEs have in accessing finance points
to a lack of competitiveness in the banking sector overall.
Financial institutions appear to be complacent with their
current client base and do not face market pressure to go
after the SME segment. However, further analysis is merited to identify specific bottlenecks reducing the ability of
creditworthy firms and economically viable projects from
getting financing, especially among SMEs (see Appendix
2.2. for more analysis of potential constraints).
185. Access to technology and business-development services are additional constraints on SMEs. SMEs
find it difficult to access technology to upgrade their businesses. A 2015 study showed that while access to finance
was the foremost constraint (49 percent), the second
most-cited constraint by SMEs (23 percent) was access to
technology71. Much of the public and private technology
transfer institutions operate primarily or exclusively in Colombo and there are rigidities in accessing project-based

funding from banks to finance investments in technological upgrading. There are also market failures in providing business development services (BDS), to support
improvements of SMEs’ management and business practices (accounting, auditing, business planning, marketing,
energy efficiency, etc.). While multiple public, private and
donor-funded initiatives have begun providing BDS across
the country, the majority of SMEs still indicate a lack of
awareness of such services, while certain critical needs of
SMEs (taxation advisory, market intelligence, digital technology, etc.) are not being met by existing BDS providers72.
Rigorous evaluations focused on intensive technical assistance and subsidized consulting services find positive and
significant impacts on productivity and return on assets in
the short run, and employment in the long run.73

The State as Market Participant
186. Beyond its role as a regulator, the state has increasingly become a direct participant in Sri Lanka’s
economy. As described in the following two sections, the
state is an important participant through its SOE sector,
as well as through its role as an employer. Both of these
roles have an impact on the ability of the private sector
to participate in the economy and have affected competitiveness in a number of sectors as well as labor market
dynamics.
187. In playing its role in ensuring the provision of
public services and infrastructure, Sri Lanka’s government has primarily used traditional procurement rather than seeking partnerships with the private sector
in the past decade. Investment in infrastructure over the
past decade has been driven by public spending. While in
some cases this was tied to the terms of external financing
for infrastructure, there was a policy of directly spending
to build assets to be owned by the state. Of course, private
investment was not discouraged and there is cooperation
in many sectors. Yet there are very few public-private partnerships (PPPs), especially for the building or operation of
infrastructure, under which the government would seek
to share risks and take advantage of private-sector financing know-how, and innovation. Even in instances where
the government has recognized the need for private sec-

70 For example, long judiciary processes to foreclose collateral in case
of borrowers’ default usually leads banks to request higher collateralization levels to cover for the additional costs associated.

Box 4.3 Defining State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
State-owned enterprises are a subset of what are legally defined as public enterprises. The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises
identifies six categories of institutions that fall under its oversight: regulatory bodies, promotional agencies, state-owned enterprises,
educational agencies, development agencies and research institutions. There are about 240 entities that fall under the committee’s ambit,
many of which are financed by the budget. Regular monitoring and reporting is carried out by the MoF for 55 larger SOBEs, which have
commercial income. For the purposes of the SCD, the 55 SOBEs are referred to as SOEs.
tor involvement and ownership, it is rare for the private
sector to receive more than 50 percent ownership, which
is often needed to attract quality operators wary of undue
state interference. Notably, private-sector power-generation projects require partnership with the state.
188. To date Sri Lanka lacks robust PPP legislation,
an institutional mechanism and capacity to plan,
structure and implement PPP projects, and regulatory structures to ensure public interests and investor
concerns are balanced. Sri Lanka continues to lack the
necessary technical expertise to enter into large-scale PPP
projects in a transparent and mutually beneficial manner,
and many infrastructure

PPP legislation and attempts at creating instituan institutional tional mechanisms for PPPs

mechanism to instance, the National Promanage and regulate curement Agency set up in
PPP projects 2004 with the aim of eliminating corrupt practices
and the wasting of time and
resources, and improving transparency and efficiency in
infrastructure activities did not provide a framework for
PPPs and in any case was eventually shut down in 2008.
Similarly, although a dedicated PPP unit in the BOI was set
up in 2006, it did not become a robust entity. As a result,
Sri Lanka lacks robust PPP legislation and an institutional
mechanism to manage and regulate PPP projects. In fact,
since 2009 publicly led investment was financed through
commercial borrowing in the form of Sri Lanka Development Bonds, sovereign bond issues, and other syndicated
loans, along with bilateral loans at near-commercial rates,
particularly from China. Much of the infrastructure completed post-war – two new ports, a new airport, roads and
bridges island wide, two new expressways, and two new
power plants – have been financed through these channels.
189. At the same time, the state is a major participant
in economic activities through a substantial SOE sector. There are 55 major SOEs enterprises covering a wide

82

range of sectors (Box 4.3). The 10 most important SOEs,
which account for about 90 percent of the asset base of all
major SOEs, are financial institutions (Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank, National Savings Bank, and Sri Lanka Insurance
Corporation), major public utilities (Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and the National
Water Supply and Drainage Board) and logistics/transport service providers (Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Airport
and Aviation Services, and Sri Lankan Airlines). There are
other smaller SOEs in banking, public utilities and logistics
as well. Finally, the government has major SOEs in other
sectors, including construction, livestock, lotteries, media,
marketing and distribution, plantations, pharmaceuticals,
industrial estates, mineral extraction, general trading and
timber sales. Major SOEs accounted for nearly 17 percent
of GDP in 2013 (Table 4.2).
190. SOEs play a significant role in Sri Lanka’s fiscal
balance. Transfers from the budget to public enterprises have averaged about 3 percent of total expenditures
(around 50 billion LKR), mainly driven by direct transfers
and on lending to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The
total debt of the 55 major SOEs accounted for approximately 4.8 percent of total public debt in 2013. This number reflects reductions in debt thanks to conversions of
debt to government equity and capital infusions to strategic State-Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs), which have
regularly occurred and were particularly large in 2013
(Ministry of Finance and Treasury).
191. Moreover, SOEs account for a significant share
of lending. The two largest banks in the country continue
to lend a significant share of their funds to SOEs, including
several that are loss-making or non-revenue-generating
enterprises. In 2013, Bank of Ceylon (the largest bank by
asset base and lending portfolio, holding 20 percent of
market share) lent 38 percent of its total portfolio to SOEs
(primarily to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Sri Lanka
Ports Authority and Road Development Authority); and
People’s Bank (the second largest bank with 15.6 percent
market share) lent 28 percent of its total portfolio to SOEs
(with high exposure to Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon
Petroleum Corporation, and Ceylon Fertilizer Company
Ltd). Since these banks account for a large share of the

banking industry, this high SOE exposure could reduce
funding available to the private sector and expose the
banking sector to systemic risks given the precarious financial positions of the concerned SOEs.
192. SOEs have a significant market share in many
sectors, including areas where there is not a strong apparent rationale for public intervention. While public
ownership of utilities and major infrastructure can be warranted to oversee natural monopolies or address free/easy
rider problems, a significant number of major SOEs remain
in sectors that do not obviously have these features (Table
4.2). This is most striking in the finance sector, where major
SOEs make up close to half of the market. While the overall
market shares are less significant, SOEs also are important
in several agricultural subsectors. One rationale commonly provided for commercial SOEs is that state intervention
is warranted to ensure service or provide employment to
remote populations where the private sector is not active,
but there is little evidence to demonstrate this necessity.

193. The large SOE sector is largely a legacy issue.
Most major SOEs were established in the 1960s and 1970s,
with some -- notably the largest state bank, the Bank of
Ceylon -- founded prior to independence. In the past 15
years, the state has set up six new enterprises: three small
banks, one insurance company, a trading company, and
a new airline (which recently was merged with the other
state-owned airline, Sri Lankan Airlines). Thus, while the
SOE sector is large, it has not been growing substantively,
with the partial exception of entrants in the finance sector.
Many of the SOEs reflect earlier, more statist policies, such
as the state plantations that were nationalized in the early
1970s.
194. Efforts to restructure SOEs were undertaken
during the 1990s and early 2000s and reversed after
2005. In the mid-1990s, the government launched an effort to reform underperforming SOEs, setting up the Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC) to carry out this
work. Under the aegis of PERC, privatization took place

in varying degrees, affecting 86 SOEs in the electricity industry, telecoms industry, ports, agriculture, and the national airline.74 The post-2005 government had an explicit
anti-privatization policy that in some cases led to reversals of past privatizations.75 The government of the past
nine years sought to make SOEs perform better, including through the establishment of the Strategic Enterprise
Management Agency (SEMA), which focused on 20 of the
most important SOEs.
195. Following the end of the conflict in 2009, the
military initiated business enterprises, though the
scale of this activity is difficult to measure and its future is unclear. Most notable among these are tourism
and associated businesses that are widely advertised.
The Sri Lanka Army76 now runs at least six tourist hotels
across the country, while the Sri Lanka Air Force77 runs a
golf course, two tourist hotels, and two banquet and convention halls. It also operates a civilian passenger airline
service, a veterinary service, and a hair salon in Colombo.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Navy78 operates a whale-watching boat service, a restaurant in Colombo, three wedding
and convention halls, and seven tourist hotels across the
country. In addition to tourist activities, the armed forces
have been engaged in agricultural farming (specifically in
lands belonging to families in the North), vegetable distribution, running small shops and cafes (mainly along transport routes to the North), civil construction works (mainly
for Colombo urban upgrading projects), and conducting
“leadership training” at military camps for university entrants. These initiatives were tied to the 2005-14 government, calling into question the extent to which they will be
continued under a new government.

74 The Public Enterprise Reform Commission, established by Act No.
1 of 1996, was mandated to improve efficiency in the economy, increase
government revenue and motivate the private sector, but not explicitly
to divest from and privatize SOEs. Nevertheless, divestiture did generate
over $500 million between 1995 and 1998, attracted a further $400 million in foreign inflows, and private investments in the gas, steel, telecoms,
plantations and civil aviation sectors.

IV. Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

196. Sri Lanka has had a diffuse arrangement for
overseeing SOEs, complicating strategic management.
At the highest level, the Parliamentary Committee on
Public Enterprises oversees financial and operational performance of SOEs through an annual review mechanism.
More operational oversight responsibility for major SOEs
has been shared between line ministries and MoF, through
its Department of Public Enterprises. The line ministries
have in turn appointed members of boards of directors of
SOEs in accordance with the

and a similar Strategic Re- making strategic
source Management Committee were separately set decisions
up to provide managerial support, although reforms are
mooted to bring SEMA into the MoF. None of these entities
appear to have had oversight over enterprises launched
by the military.79 This decentralized model complicates
holistic oversight of SOEs’ performance and management
of financial risk. In particular, critical information on economic and financial performance, such as return to equity
and overall contingent liabilities of SOEs, are not systematically tracked. SOEs have de facto considerable discretion to set their own policies and strategies, including in
sensitive personnel areas. The system also does not easily
provide for making strategic decisions to maximize value
to the state of SOEs or management changes such as restructuring. The new government has indicated a change
of course through consolidation of oversight by establishing a specialized ministry for SOEs, but its impact remains
to be seen.
197. There is strong political involvement with SOE
management. SOEs have requirements for the profile of
its board directors spelled out either in their founding cct
or more general guidelines, with a MoF representative always present. But given the direct subordination to particular ministries, practice is that a change of government
automatically triggers the resignation of boards and the
appointment of a new board. The political connections
of SOEs can lead to management decisions based on
non-commercial criteria. Most important, the closeness of
political connections increases the likelihood of SOEs receiving preferable treatment.
198. The size, profile, and management framework
for SOEs can negatively impact Sri Lanka’s competi-

200. While overall wage employment has declined in
favor of self-employment, the composition of wage employment has shifted towards the public sector. Overall
wage employment declined from 58 to 56.4 percent of the
workforce between 2002 and 2012 in favor of self-employment. This decline in wage employment was accompanied
by a decline in the share of private-sector wage employment throughout the decade; it fell from 77 to 74 percent
of total wage employment between 2002 and 2012 (Figure
4.26). In contrast, public employment increased from 23 to
26 percent of wage employment when looking at comparable districts. Given the growth of the workforce, this
seemingly small percentage increase meant an increase of
over 95,000 non-farm public workers between 2006 and
2012, peaking at 27 percent of total wage employment in
2009 when large numbers of men joined the armed forces
(Figure 4.26). Since then, public employment relative to all
formal-wage employment has declined somewhat, but it

202. To the extent that public-sector employment is
a growing share of total formal employment, this has
repercussions for the wage premium for private-sector formal workers. Indeed, private formal wages were
on average 35 percent higher than informal wages.

differences in characteristics and the types of jobs typical

199. Strong demand for public-sector jobs has met
the increased supply of such jobs. As was discussed in
Chapter II, there has been a 57 percent increase in public-sector employment (public service and semi-public entities) over the past 10 years. This has met with steady demand from the population for public-sector jobs, despite
the private-sector growth and the consequent demand for
labor. Data on the total applicant pool for various publicsector jobs is not available,

past 10 years For the period 2008-13, there
was an average recruitment
of 163 people per year from an average pool of over 20,000
applicants, of which slightly more than half actually sat for
exams. Only the engineering and scientific services experience difficulties in recruiting staff. Moreover, the vast majority of public servants stay in the service until retirement.

201. Public-sector workers not only enjoy the benefits
of formal employment, but they also tend to earn more
than their private-sector counterparts. Public-sector
workers have access to a non-contributory public pension
system (see Chapter III), paid vacations, and importantly,
reduced work hours relative to private-sector counterparts. Moreover, public sector hourly wages were on average 40 percent higher than private sector wages in 2012.
Part of the wage gap can be explained by differences in
individual characteristics, since public-sector workers tend
to be more educated. However, decompositions show that
there continues to be a wage premium for public workers
that cannot be explained by observable inividual characteristics. In fact, 14 percent of the difference in wages between public and private workers cannot be explained by
observable differences (Figure 4.27A). The evidence suggests that there is a premium to public-sector work, and
that this premium has grown between 2006 and 2012.

tiveness. The concentration of assets under management
that is prone to politicization can lead to unproductive utilization of the country’s assets. It also likely dampens competition in key sectors; even if there has been basis for the
state’s involvement owing to the absence of market actors,
SOEs will discourage future entrants. There is no formal
mechanism to verify that there is a public purpose rationale for individual SOEs. In the context of the no-privatization policy in recent years this has meant that the sector
continues to play an outsized role.

203. In fact, the evidence shows that workers, particularly educated women, are queuing for public-sector
employment. The share of new job seekers looking for
public-sector work increased between 2006 and 2012,
mostly on account of women. The share of women looking for work for the first time who specifically sought public-sector employment increased from 25 to 31 percent between 2006 and 2012 (Figure 4.28A). Most of this increase

of formal and informal workers (Figure 4.27B). Together
this lends some credence to the argument that markets
are segmented, particularly for wage workers who would
likely prefer formal public sector jobs but are rationed out
or excluded. To the extent that public- sector employment
offers better working conditions for certain types of workers, the private sector will find it difficult to compete for
the best workers.

Box 4.4 State intervention in agriculture
Sri Lanka’s government plays a particularly large role in agriculture, consistent with inward-oriented policies, inefficient land markets, and
a large SOE sector, which, together, create distortions.
Agricultural trade and price policies. Sri Lanka’s agricultural policies have encouraged import substitution of basic agricultural
commodities. Border taxes on imports and exports of agricultural products and tradable agricultural inputs have to generate fiscal revenue,
support farmers engaged in import-competing activities and tax producers of export-oriented products. Import duties,and other taxes at
the border yield nominal protection rates for importables for most agricultural products in the order of 30–50 percent. For rice, the total
protection rate was 34 percent in 2011, making it a highly protected crop, mainly as result of fertilizer subsidies. Maize, potatoes and milk
are highly protected as well. Exports of tea and rubber are taxed at low rates.
The high protection of importables has created strong disincentives for crop and export diversification, providing support to expand
production of import-competing crops (rice, maize) and discouraging the production of exportables. While agricultural export promotion
is highlighted in various policy statements, Sri Lanka’s trade policy is overly complex and slows rather than accelerates export growth.
Protection also results in inefficient use of public resources, and does not benefit smallholders as intended. Additional distortions are
created by land-use restriction and policies that target subsidized fertilizers for particular sectors, such as paddy.
The distortions affect producers and consumers. Rice producers gain at the expense of consumers. Income from paddy farming is estimated
to be 36 percent higher than what it would be without government intervention. Similarly, incomes from potato and milk production are
significantly higher while the policy impact on incomes from tea and rubber production is insignificant. Coconut farmers, on other hand,
experience significant income reductions due to export taxes. The aggregate effect on agricultural income in absolute terms depends
on the levels of production of all crops and the crop mix fostered by the incentive structure. Current policies represent an implicit tax on
consumers of about 300 percent on maize and chili, 96 percent on milk, 54 percent on potatoes and 12 percent on rice.
Land tenure and rural land markets. Sri Lanka’s current land tenure policy, which restricts use rights and transferability, depresses
returns to land and the absence of a functioning rural land market constrains long-run sector performance. Smallholder farmers are, in
essence, prevented from mobilizing one of their most important assets for promoting much-need investment into an under-funded underinvested sector.
While government policy has aimed at equitable distribution of land, it has also fostered and perpetuated smallholder agriculture. Land
legislation and settlement administration have successively limited farm size and constrained the rights of both owners and operators.
Population pressure and inheritance practices have caused substantial fragmentation, leaving average farm-size well below the publicsector-irrigation-scheme norm of one hectare. Overall, 72 percent of farms are below one hectare. In the absence of a rural land market,
irrigation-scheme settlers wishing to exit agriculture face a choice of abandoning a valuable farm or entering the uncertain informal market
while market-based land consolidation necessary for productivity growth remains depressed.
Functioning land markets would allow farmers to adjust size to respond to changing commodity prices and increased risks. The key to
making this work is secure tenancy agreements and a stronger leasehold market. For public- sector land, long-term leases with provision
for easy transfer would be a major improvement. For private-sector land, mechanisms to resolve title disputes through administrative and
legal means as well as incentive systems are an immediate necessity. Legislation and programs to establish public- and private-sector
institutions and professions to facilitate development of land markets are also required.
The government should seek to unlock productivity potential in rural areas, particularly given the importance of the
sector for poverty reduction. Sri Lanka’s low productivity levels – and the lack of incentives for farmers to improve productivity – call
for renewed attention to basic investments in technology, extension services, irrigation, and market infrastructure. They also call for
adjustments in the broader enabling policy framework to foster diversification and productivity and improve export competitiveness. This
will not only include investments in restoring and further upgrading the country’s productive infrastructure, facilitating market linkages,
and introducing modern agricultural technologies but also creating a policy environment that favors the expansion of the private sector,
especially SMEs, and allowing for more flexibility in the rural land, labor and capital markets.

is due to women with post-secondary training looking for
public employment. That size of that group increased from
42 to 52 percent of all women looking for employment
Educated women between 2006 and 2012,
in particular are when looking at comparable samples (Figure 4.28B).
increasingly looking If the Northern and Eastern
for public sector provinces are included, this
employment share increases to about 54
percent. Indeed, many workers, particularly women, are
in fields of study that put them on a path to public-sector
employment. Since science and mathematics pass rates
are poor in secondary schools and there is relatively little
access to schools offering A-level science streams, many
are compelled to study humanities if they want to go on
to do A-levels. As a result, the most popular career streams
are often not the ones where there is the highest demand
for labor. For instance, there are too many studying humanities instead of subjects that would position them for
jobs in the booming areas of tourism, finance, etc.).

Interconnectedness of Public and Private Sectors
204. There is a high degree of interconnectedness
between the state and at least segments of the private
sector that contributes to the degree of intervention
by the government. The variation in tax and customs
incentives reflects government policy but those varying
incentives also contain specific benefits for specific sectors, which have a limited number of major actors. In addition, there are several high-profile cases of senior officials
moving between public and private sectors. For instance,
the state frequently uses
its various shareholdings
There is no developed in commercial banks to apframework for point members to boards of
handling conflict of directors, and in the process,
several current government
interest officials and former central
bankers have been appointed. Meanwhile, pension funds managed by the Central
Bank – the banking regulator – began investing in several
financial sector firms in recent years. At the same time, major business figures have in a few instances taken up senior
positions in government in recent years. There is no developed framework for handling conflict of interest to police
the boundary between public sector employment and private sector interests. The politically appointed boards of
SOEs also serve to reinforce networks of influential public
and private sector players.

IV. Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

205. This interconnectedness points to political economy factors that support a continued large role for
government in the market. Given that there are frequent
instances of state regulatory help to a given sector, it follows that private sector entities would seek to maintain
or expand privileges, reinforcing the level of regulatory
intervention into the economy. At the same time, it also
suggests that many private-sector entities would have to
adjust considerably to succeed in a more open, competitive market. Combined with broader expectation of public-sector employment, a reduction of the state’s role or
an attempt to “level the playing field” will encounter resistance from vested interests.

D. Priorities for Fostering More
and Better Jobs for the Bottom 40
Percent
Promote Export-Led Growth
206. Review and revise the country’s trade-related policies to promote economic diversification and
shared growth. This could include reforming the para-tariff regime to encourage more foreign trade. It also
likely would entail revisions to the tax system, in line
with addressing fiscal constraints, to reduce the degree
of protectionism, particularly for targeted small sectors.
This would include simplification of the VAT and corporate-income-tax regimes and the reduction or elimination
of cesses on agricultural commodities. Reductions would
need to be considered in the context of whether the incentives are achieving the desired objective. Finally, a continued focus on improving the trade facilitation and logistics
environment, including streamlining licenses and permits
required to export, would help to promote export-led
growth.
207. Provide for more resources and quality-enhancing management in the education sector to ensure
that the population (and especially the youth) has the
skills demanded by efficiency-enhancing enterprises.
This could include steps to: ensure high-quality general
education and development of soft skills; enable greater
private-sector participation in higher education, improvements in technical and vocational training and better coordination with potential employer needs; and ensure that
young people are inclined to pursue degrees in the industries where demand is highest.
208. Promote innovation by establishing linkages between R&D institutions and networks of entrepreneurs

that can benefit. Development adaptation and better dissemination of technologies that fit Sri Lanka’s economy is
important for productivity growth. R&D institutions need
to be oriented towards filling this role. This may, in part, be
helped by encouraging more private-sector involvement
directly in R&D as well as in setting priorities for public-sector institutions. This is a particularly important issue for agriculture.

Rebalance the Role of Public and Private Sectors
to Promote Private-Sector Led Growth
209. Improve the regulatory environment to allow
firms to grow, reducing informality and allowing for
economy-wide increases in productivity and allow
firms to reach as firms can reach economies of scale.
Some aspects of the regulatory environment that appear
to be significant obstacles are: upgrading the systems for
land tenure and land use planning in both agricultural
and rural areas; modernizing labor legislation to encourage easier movement of labor and female labor participation; ensuring that the burden of business licensing and
permitting is minimal, particularly in regions where this
is a problem, such as the North; and providing for speedier resolution of commercial disputes and enforcement
of contracts in court or using alternative dispute mechanisms. Bringing larger and more profitable firms into the
formal system and improving enforcement could help
formalization efforts. However, the definition of priorities

for investment-climate reforms to unleash firms’ potential
should stem from regular dialogue between the public
and private sectors.
210. Review the role and participation of the public
sector in the economy. Stronger management and strategic oversight of the SOE sector is important to ensure
that state involvement is serving a public purpose, does
not create unwarranted fiscal risk and public assets are
effectively utilized. The state should also take steps to ensure that the public service is “fit for purpose” to carry out
public-sector functions and not as a mechanism for job
creation. The state can play a role that facilitates greater
private-sector involvement through the establishment of
a robust institutional framework for public-private partnerships to ensure public interests and investor concerns
are balanced while crowding in private-sector investment
and skills. Finally, measures to address conflict of interest
could reduce negative impacts of the interconnectedness
of government with specific businesses.
211. These measures together will help provide an
environment conducive to efficiency- and productivity-enhancing FDI, allowing for less emphasis on targeted incentives. A predictable, private-sector-friendly
regulatory environment and a skilled labor force can contribute to attracting and retaining FDI. Sri Lanka’s incentives regime may need to be revamped as its competitiveness improves and as streamlined investment policies and
regulations are adopted and implemented.

KEY PRIORITIES ON INCLUSION
■■

■■

■■

■■

Using urbanization to drive inclusion. This is enhanced if there is a governance framework that empowers local
decision-making responsive to the needs of the poor and bottom 40 percent for public services and infrastructure.
Multi-sector interventions to improve public service provision and promote employment opportunities in areas
where poverty is localized -- including the Northern and Eastern provinces, Moneragala and the Estates; emphasis should also be devoted to reducing nutritional deprivation.
Promoting reconciliation and efforts to improve equality of opportunity across ethnic groups. This includes promoting employment opportunities, addressing land claims in the former conflict areas, providing assistance to
new and former internally displaced persons (IDPs), and integrated efforts to assist widows and ex-combatants.
Increasing female labor force participation by: increasing education and better aligning the education women
pursue and the demands of the market; making changes to legislation that prevents or deters women from
being hired; and promoting greater participation of women in leadership positions.

Dimensions of Inclusion

A. Inclusion across Space

212. As is true with many countries, there are four dimensions of social inclusion that are important in Sri
Lanka: inclusion across space, ethnicity, gender and
youth. Constraints in each of these areas preclude the
ability of large population groups from fully participating
in shared prosperity. More generally, intersecting identities can produce a multiplication of disadvantage. For instance, the intersection of ethnicity, gender and location
(or youth and location) can lead to increased negative
effects. This section seeks to define areas where lack of
inclusiveness is evident. It must be noted that these problems can be addressed through specific interventions and
especially by actions to provide for equal opportunity of
participation for all segments in society, the economy and
politics. Opportunities for participation should be promoted alongside efforts to provide for effective public-sector
management and growth through competitiveness described in the previous two chapters.

Spatial Concentration of Poverty

213. The importance of addressing exclusionary constraints is heightened by Sri Lanka’s recent history of
internal conflict. Conflict negatively affected the entire
country and specific segments of the poor and bottom 40
percent in particular. As noted earlier, it is estimated that
the cost of internal conflict in the period 1978-2002 was
roughly 5 percent of GDP per annum. Not surprisingly, the
highest levels of poverty and weakest equality of opportunity are in the areas most affected by conflict, the Northern
and Eastern Provinces. Not all ways in which exclusion has
occurred in Sri Lanka directly fed past internal conflicts, nor
was exclusion the only driver of conflict. However, many
observers, including the LLRC, have noted that manifestations of exclusion played an important role in sustaining
internal conflict in the country. Addressing the need for an
inclusive society, economy, and polity is crucial for sustaining peace and security.

214. The highest numbers of people living in poverty
and the bottom 40 percent are located within the Kandy-Colombo-Galle multi-city agglomeration, followed
by the other single city agglomerations. In fact, the spatial distribution of the poor and vulnerable -- in absolute
numbers – across Sri Lanka has come to more closely mirror the spatial distribution of the overall population, leading to an increase in the relative concentration of poverty
around the country’s main urban areas. The highest numbers of people living in poverty and vulnerable to poverty
are located within the Kandy-Colombo-Galle multi-city agglomeration, followed by other single city agglomerations
(Figure 5.1).
215. The concentration of poor in more dynamic areas of agglomeration point to the importance of cities
in further poverty reduction. Almost 50 percent of both
poor and vulnerable populations are within 30 km of an Almost 50 percent
agglomeration (Figure 5.2).80

soon given that the basket of goods being used corresponds to the 2002

with Sri Lanka’s middle income status.

216. However, these interventions will need to be
complemented with others targeted to assist the poor
in more isolated regions of the country. As noted in
Chapter II, portions of the Northern and Eastern Provinces
stand out as regions with high concentrations of poverty
(Figure 5.3). This is true both for monetary and non-monetary measures of poverty such as education, nutrition,
and access to services. Areas with higher poverty rates
also tend to have a high share of the bottom 40 percent.
In addition, two districts (Nuwara Eliya and Badulla), which
make up a large portion of the estates, are home to 10.7
percent of the poor population. The analysis and recommendations in the preceding chapters are especially important for highly populated regions that can benefit the
most from opening of markets and higher competitive-

ness given their proximity to markets. This chapter focuses
on the North and East, the estate sector, and Moneragala
district. These are areas with a long-term inclusion challenge that is different from the one confronting poor areas
located near centers of economic activity.

218.
In these districts, poverty
rates are highest for the youth and those
with no education. About 47 percent of
people living in poverty in the Eastern and
Northern provinces are younger than 25
– 50 percent if the more affluent districts
of Jaffna and Vavuniya are excluded – as
compared to only 40 percent in the other
provinces. In particular, in Mannar, Mullaitivu, and Kilinochchi, poverty rates among
the youth are especially high, reaching 28
percent for 6 to 14 year olds and 22 percent
for 15 to 24 year olds.81 These high monetary poverty rates are correlated with multidimensional measures of welfare to the
extent that poverty rates are disproportionately high among those with no education.
Interestingly, poverty rates are twice as high
for those with secondary than primary education, suggesting that even reasonably
well-educated workers suffer from a lack of
job opportunities in these districts.
219. High poverty headcount rates in these regions
are associated with weak links to the labor market. This
is reflected in low labor force participation rates. Across
provinces, labor force participation rates are the lowest
for the Northern and Eastern provinces (Figure 5.4A), but
in the absence of panel data that follows individuals over
time it is difficult to see whether this is improving. When
looking at the country by sub population groups, the
Northern province stands out for its low labor force participation among males, adults, urban residents, rural residents, and those with below O-level education. Similarly,
the Eastern province stands out as having the lowest labor
force participation among youth and females.
220. In addition to low participation, the North and
East also have high unemployment rates, particularly
among the youth and among educated women. Youth

Box 5.1 Female-Headed households in the northern and eastern provinces
Female heads of household are particularly vulnerable in the
post-conflict setting of the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Most of these household are headed by widows (see figure).
However female-headed households are quite heterogeneous.
First, childcare requirements may prohibit younger widows
with small children from generating income, while older
female heads of households are less able to do certain types of
manual work. Second, widows whose husbands served in the
national army receive their husbands’ pension or 50 percent of
his salary, while widows of men fighting in the LTTE receive a
one-time payment only if they can produce a death certificate.
Third, the application of family law according to different
communities’ legal codes can create varying outcomes.
Sinhalese female heads may enjoy the benefits of a more
women-friendly Sinhalese legal code, while Muslim female
heads may face restrictions on their activities and become
particularly vulnerable when these prevent them from seizing
income-earning opportunities. Finally, the loss of assets during
the civil war can make it difficult to marry daughters as land and
house assets are commonly used as dowry. This is particularly
important in Tamil communities.

Box 5.2 Inclusion of ex-combatants
Persons with physical disabilities and psychological problems due to conflict, in particular ex-combatants, are particularly vulnerable to
exclusion. An estimated 10 to 15 percent of the population in the Northern Province – a large portion of them ex-combatants -- suffers
from a physical disability related to the conflict, In addition, epidemiological studies conducted among conflict-affected populations in
Northern Sri Lanka show that the conflict has led to increased psychosocial problems among these populations. Although mental health
issues are prevalent among ex-combatants, there is a lack of psychological assistance programs specifically designed for ex-combatants.
Notwithstanding government programs to integrate former combatants, they still struggle to enter into the labor market and have relatively
high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Social stigma -- fears of being associated with ex-combatants or perceptions that
they are still violent -- contributes to their marginalization. In a qualitative study conducted with young female ex-LTTE fighters in the
Eastern district of Batticaloa, Krishnan (2011) notes that job opportunities are more restrictive for female ex-combatants than their male
counterparts, with the biggest barrier being that they are not able to use the clerical, engineering, or other non-combat skills they had
learned. Ex-combatants face surveillance, which prompts fears that they have not been fully rehabilitated.

unemployment rates82 in the North and East were as high
as 27 percent in Ampara and 25 percent in Kilinochchi
compared to 12.5 percent in Colombo in 2012. Moreover,
the percentage of those looking for a job for more than a
year was highest (65 percent) in the Eastern province. Over
90 percent of the unemployed in the Northern and Eastern provinces were first-time job seekers, compared to 57
percent in the Western Province. Much of the reason for
high unemployment in these two provinces is explained
by high female unemployment, particularly among those
with A-level education or more. However, the probability of being unemployed is significantly higher for women in the North and East relative to Colombo, even after
controlling for educational and other individual characteristics (Figure 5.4B). For men, no significant difference
in the likelihood of unemployment is detected. The most
common search method in the North and East is to register for a government job (48 and 45 percent, respectively),
compared to Colombo where advertisements and informal family networks are more common. This difference is
especially large among well-educated workers. Together,
this evidence points to very high aspirations in the North
and East to be employed in the public sector. However,
in the absence of panel data that follows individuals over
time it is difficult to see whether aspirations are changing.
To the extent that these unmet aspirations are persistent,
they could lead to further discontent. It is also important
to note that female-headed households and ex-combatants are particularly vulnerable in a post-conflict setting
(Boxes 5.1 and 5.2).

The Estate Sector83
221. In addition to the populations in the North and
East, estate workers have long had high poverty rates.
Because the majority of them descended from indentured
labor brought from India in the early 1900s and began to
receive citizenship only in the 1980s, they lived for decades
without state provision of social services. Large inequalities continue to exist in their access to, and utilization of,
health services. Estate workers are largely dependent on
the estate’s management for their basic needs, particularly
housing.84 Since nationalization in 1975, the state has retained responsibility for providing education in the estate
sector. In 1994, the Ministry of Health was requested to
take over estate hospitals and had successfully taken over
hospitals and maternity wards and dispensaries by 2000.85
Housing and land on the estates are under the control of

past decade. Although the estate sector has traditionally
been the poorest in Sri Lanka, poverty rates typically have
been only moderately higher in the estate sector than the

83 The estate sector consists of state-owned plantations which comprise over 170,000 ha, most of which is devoted to tea and rubber cultivation. The plantations were originally set up by British colonists who
brought in Indian origin Tamils as laborers. Housing and land on the
estates remains under the control of plantation management while the
state took over provision of social services and public infrastructure in
the mid-2000s. The particular social and economic features of the estates
have led to it being treated as a separate category from the rural and
urban sectors.

rural sector. In 2002, headcount poverty was estimated
to be 30 percent in the estate sector, as compared to 25
percent in rural areas (Figure 5.5). A gap between the rural
and estate sectors emerged in 2006/07, after poverty fell
rapidly in rural areas but changed little in the estate sector.
By 2009/10, however, the estate sector had largely caught
up to the rural sector, and by 2012/13 the estimated headcount poverty rate in the estate sector was 10.9 percent,
compared with 6.8 and 1.8 percent in rural and urban areas, respectively (Figure 5.5). In fact, most of the decrease
in estate poverty during the period of 2002-2012/13 occurred between 2006 and 2009 (from 28 to 11 percent).

The large reduction in estate poverty is corroborated by
other welfare indicators, such as the multidimensional
welfare index reported by United Nations Development
Programme (2012), which show a decline in multidimensional poverty from 21.1 percent to 11.4 percent between
2006 and 2009.
223. One potential explanation for this sharp decline
in estate sector poverty is the substantial increase in
the price of tea, which is the major output of the estate
sector as well as Sri Lanka’s largest exported commodity
by export value. The Colombo auction price for tea surged

while the quantity of total tea exports remained stable.
This resulted in much higher profit margins and revenue
for the tea industry, as reflected by higher ratio of auction
price and production cost (Figure 5.6), along with higher
wages for estate workers.
224. In fact, wage increases were larger in the estate
sector when compared to the agricultural sector as a
whole (Figure 5.7A). This may be partly because estate
workers had negotiated minimum wage increases between 2009 and 2010. When controlling for individual characteristics, the premium for being an estate-sector worker
relative to an urban worker has significantly increased over
time (Figure 5.7B). Although real wages in the rural sector
have been statistically the same as what an observationally equivalent worker would earn in the urban sector, they
were significantly higher than real earnings in the estate
sectors in 2009 and 2010. This highlights a large increase
in profitability during that time period for own-account
farmers compared to estate worker earnings, despite the
increase in minimum wages. However, rural-sector worker
premiums have since fallen, in line with commodity prices.

the $2.50 poverty line, the poverty headcount is 50.6 percent in the estates compared to 34.3 percent in rural and
17.7 percent in urban areas. In fact, about 40 percent of
the population in the estate sector still lives between the
national poverty line and $2.50 a day (2005 PPP). This indicates that a large share of the estate sector population is
nearly poor and is vulnerable to adverse shocks. Moreover,
the poverty gap index, measuring how far people are from
the poverty line, is also considerably higher in the estates,
at 13.4 percent compared to 8.9 percent in rural areas at
the $2.50 poverty line (Figure 5.8). Moreover, 62.7 percent
of the population in the estate sector is in the bottom 40
percent of the distribution, compared to 42.5 percent for
rural and 23.3 percent for urban populations.

226. Non-monetary indicators of poverty, health and
nutrition are worrisome, especially in the estates. Island-wide 21 percent of children under 5 are underweight,
16 percent of babies born have low birth weight and 16
percent of women of reproductive age (15-49) are malnourished. Estates have the highest maternal mortality
rates in the country, and both estate women and children
suffer from severe malnutrition. About 30 percent of children below 5 are underweight, nearly one in three babies
born have low birth weight, and one-third of women of reproductive age are malnourished (Figure 5.9). A significant
reason for child and maternal malnutrition in the estate
sector was intake of the “wrong” kind of foods, specifically those lacking in protein.86 The fact that estate women
traditionally eat whatever remains after men and children
have been fed is considered a contributing factor to women’s malnourishment.87 Being undernourished and overworked, mothers in the estates give birth to weak children
and have inadequate breast milk, both of which contribute
to high levels of infant mortality.
227. Housing provided for the estate workers is often described as inadequate. Estate-sector households
are less likely to have drinking water, sanitary facilities or
electricity within their households. The differences are particularly large for availability of drinking water; only 68.1
percent of households in the estates have drinking water
available inside their premises, compared to 77.3 percent
of households in rural areas (Figure 5.10). Similarly, less
than one-third of estate households have a toilet available
in their unit, compared to 43.2 percent of households in
rural areas. Philips (2005) argues that the lack of toilets and
running water implies that mothers and daughters need
to wake up early in the morning and go to bushes for bathing and other needs, exposing them to all kinds of threats.
Often, entire families live in so-called line rooms – barrack- type single rooms that are roughly 12 by 10 feet and
described as crowded, damp, smoky and dark with leaking roofs and inadequate light and ventilation.88 Housing,
education, health care and childcare are often provided as
non-monetary “welfare packages” to estate workers. It is
argued these create a total dependency of workers on the
management for all aspects of their lives.89
228. Moreover, access to services and the quality of
services in the estates is comparatively low. Travel times
generally mean that estate workers are isolated in terms
of access to health and education. Estate workers need

to travel longer to reach a bus stop, secondary education
and the nearest hospital (Figure 5.11). Most schools in the
estates are primary schools and upon completion of primary education, students have to travel to nearby villages to continue with secondary education. Poor roads and
lack of transport facilities may contribute to the low enrollment rates at the secondary schools among the estate
population.90 Health facilities in the estates do not meet

national standards; hospitals in the estate sector are less
well equipped and there are fewer trained health staff and
medicine.91 Poor quality of health services pushes estate
workers to obtain private health services at higher prices.92
Estate hospitals were taken over by the government in
2007, but it has been difficult to send doctors to staff those
hospitals due to their remote locations. Estate schools
are also run by the public sector, and, again, allocation
of teachers (especially Tamil-speaking teachers) has been
difficult. Successive governments have changed teacher
recruitment policies (including school-based recruitments
rather than national level recruitments) to improve the situation.
229. Poor outcomes in education impede the ability
of the estate population to participate in Sri Lankan
society. Across sectors, the greatest improvement in education attainment is seen in the estate sector, but it still
remains low compared to other sectors.93 For instance, the
proportion of those who have completed primary level education improved from 82 percent to 86 percent in Sri Lan-

ka as a whole, with the corresponding improvement in the
estate sector from 53 percent to 63 percent. The proportion of those who have completed O-levels improved from
7 percent to 9 percent in the estate sector. However, the
proportion of the estate-sector working-age population
with at least A-levels remains low at 3 percent, although
improved from 1 percent in 2003. The estates not only
have low levels of education for adults relative to the rest
of the country (Figure 5.12A), but more importantly, they
have lower enrollment rates, particularly among 15 to 20
year olds, of which only 49 percent are enrolled compared
to 66 percent in rural areas (Figure 5.12B).

on average. This shift in the population structure also coincided with a movement away from agriculture wage work
among those who live in the estates, while the share of
workers engaged in non-agricultural activities – primarily
manufacturing, transport, commerce and community services – increased from 24 to 30 percent between 2006 and
2010, but then declined somewhat in 2012 (Figure 5.13).
231. The educated estate youth face difficulties in
accessing salaried employment outside the estate
sector. While opportunities for estate youth to work in
service-sector industries, such as retail stores and communication centers, are expanding in nearby villages, the
opportunities to work in professional, salaried occupations
are not easily available to the estate youth. Despite their
preference to work in such occupations, estate youth has
to compete with better educated and socialized peers
from the rural and urban sectors who are preferred by employers.94 Due to this situation many estate youth take on
lower-level job openings, such as domestic workers, shop
assistants or construction workers, and relatively few are
able to secure jobs as semi-skilled workers, such as drivers
or mechanics. According to a qualitative study conducted by Gunetilleke et al. (2008), most of the estate youth
reported facing stigmatization and discrimination due
to their Indian Tamil ethnicity and estate worker identity,
both of which constitute a barrier in accessing non-estate
job opportunities. While youth unemployment is low and
declining relative to the rest of the country (Figure 5.14),

the share of estate youth who are out of the labor force
has increased by over 40 percent, compared to an 18 percent growth in rural areas. Although this may be correlated
with a higher share of youth being enrolled in school, it
also suggests “voluntary” inactivity due to the mismatch of
job opportunities and aspirations.
232. Women in the estates face additional layers
of exclusion. Women tend to be employed for the lowest-paying unskilled tasks that require intense labor such

Box 5.3 Gender-based violence: one of the most extreme forms of exclusion
GBV is one of the most extreme interferences with women’s dignity, and it impacts their opportunities to participate in
society. The forms of violence faced by the women in Sri Lanka range from rape and domestic violence to sexual harassment in public
transportation. All these prevent women’s access to health, education and employment opportunities. Legal consequences for rapists are rare
and, in a UN-led survey, only 34 percent of those who admitted rape felt worried or guilty about their actions, suggesting that social norms are
permissive of this extreme form of violence against women.
Several studies argue that violence against women has increased due to conflict and disaster. The presence of military forces,
the setting of displacement camps, the loss of male household members to war and alcohol abuse caused by war-related trauma increase
insecurity for women. The tsunami additionally contributed to this environment of insecurity for women, who became victims of sexual and
domestic violence both in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and during the post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction process.
Finally, due to instability caused by the conflict and natural disaster, girls were rushed into child marriages to tsunami widowers who sought
government subsidies for marrying and starting a family, creating vulnerability.
Gender-based violence is linked to cultural norms and attitudes about masculinity. In a survey conducted in Colombo, Hambantota,
Nuwara Eliya and Batticaloa districts, de Mel et al (2013) argue that male perpetration of gender-based violence is linked to cultural attitudes
about how to be a man. The study found that majority of men as well as women linked manhood to dominance, toughness and violence. Men
who reported committing sexual violence often were motivated by sexual entitlement – as men they perceive themselves as having right to
have sexual relations with women. Fifty five percent of men in the sample agreed that in case of rape one would have to question whether
the victim is promiscuous or has a bad reputation. Regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), 41 percent of male respondents agreed with
the statement that a woman should tolerate violence in order to keep the family together. Around 78 percent of men affirmed the view that
women should obey their husbands, while 58 percent of men stated that women could not refuse their husbands. Women also contribute to
the persistence of inequitable gender norms: 58 percent of women (a higher percentage than men) believed that a woman should tolerate
IPV in order to keep the family together. Moreover, 75 percent of women agreed that, “some women ask to be raped by the way they dress
and behave.”. According to the study, male attitudes on reproductive issues, equal wages, children’s education, women associations and
entry into politics were more equitable. Seventy percent of men agreed that women should be in public decision-making roles and 62
percent supported the greater participation of women at the elections. Lastly, the study emphasized particular vulnerabilities that men face
throughout their lives, which increases their risk of perpetration of violence against women. Economic pressures resulting from inadequate
income, lack of economic assets, and financial responsibilities as breadwinners are found to be among the primary causes of male stress and
lack of well-being. Male respondents are also found to have moderate level of depression and suicidal thoughts.

as tea plucking or rubber tapping.95 According to Kotikula
and Solotaroff (2006), approximately 86 percent of female
estate workers are fieldworkers and estate women face obstacles in moving up to higher-level positions. Gender segregation varies by the type of estate management as well
as the type of crop; it is found to be less severe in rubber
estates, where 25 percent of supervisors are women, compared to 5 percent in tea estates. Despite being income
earners, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that estate women’s wages are often collected by their husbands
or fathers who, in turn, often spend it on alcohol.96 Their
status in the estates makes women vulnerable to gender-based violence (GBV), and not only at home; there are
also frequent reports of harassment, rape and abuse of es-

tate workers by male supervisors in the fields. According to
a qualitative study commissioned by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 2003 with 350 women in estates
in Hatton, 83 percent of women were found to be victims
of GBV (Box 5.3).97

233. More generally, alcoholism is found to be an issue in the estates.98 Poor housing and infrastructure are
seen as one of the reasons behind high levels of alcoholism
in the estates. In the qualitative study conducted by the
Center for Poverty Analysis in 2005 with the estate population, alcoholism was identified as a major community
problem, especially by female and young respondents,
and it was perceived as a primary cause of poverty. According to a baseline survey conducted in 2005 in the estates,

the number of working men who regularly consume alcohol was found to range between 50 to 75 percent.99 The
same survey also revealed that 25 to 50 percent of daily
earnings were spent on alcohol. Alcoholism in estates has

and diverting funds from basic needs. Alcoholism is also

lenges, including loss of jobs and social support mechanisms, for the estate population.

234. Over the longer term, RPCs face major challenges which, given their extensive role in providing services, may impact the estate population. RPCs historically provided social support “from womb to tomb” and
continue to provide some services as well as guaranteed
lifetime employment. While the youth seek to leave the
estates in general, there is still a large population, including a significant number of elderly dependents. The RPCs’
business model is under pressure from a combination of
factors: declining profitability due to relatively higher
wages after several increases over the past decade while
facing stiff competition from more productive growers in
Kenya and India; declining prices for estate commodities
(tea, coconut products, and rubber); and reduced demand
from key historical consumers in Russia and the Middle
East. There are estimates that up to half of tea plantations’
acreage requires replanting. The difficult prospects for the
sector may translate into profound socio-economic chal-

235. Persistent high poverty rates in Moneragala are
related to its strong reliance on agriculture and relatively little diversification within households to other
industries. Moneragala is the second largest of the 25 districts in Sri Lanka, with relatively low population density
(82 per square kilometer compared to an average of 331
for the country as a whole in 2014101). Moneragala is home
to tea, rubber and coconut plantations and a large number
of small holders, with 34 percent of households cultivating paddy land compared to 18 percent for the country
as a whole. As such, it is mostly an agricultural district; 57
percent of the workforce engaged in agricultural activities,
compared to 31 percent for the country as a whole, while
only 32 percent of workers are in services compared to 43
percent for the country as a whole (LFS, 2012). Moreover,
it has a relatively high share of self-employed agricultural
workers and unpaid family workers, and relatively fewer
non-farm or wage employees. The relatively low density of
the population coupled with the high reliance on agriculture suggests that households in Moneragala are less diversified, and as such, are especially vulnerable to agricultural price fluctuations and have few alternative sources of
income (Figure 5.15A).

236. Persistent high poverty rates in Moneragala are
also related to relatively low access to services. Average
levels of education are below the national average, with
about eight years of education compared to the national
average of nine. Access to services is in line with the national average, with the exception of electricity and sanitation, which are well below the country average. Travel
times to secondary schools, hospitals and agricultural centers are also higher than for the rest of the country (Figure
5.15B). Approximately one-third of total area in the district
is covered by natural forests under natural parks and/or
sanctuaries that are not available for human development.
However, there is increasing encroachment of forests, a
growing human-wildlife conflict, and soil degradation
from gem mining in its granite deposits.102 Further analysis
on the determinants of poverty in Moneragala would be
useful to design multi-sector interventions that could help
to reduce the relatively high levels of poverty prevalent in
the district.

poverty line, the poverty headcount for Indian Tamils is
46.3 and for Sri Lankan Tamils is 44.4 percent, compared to
an overall poverty headcount of 32.1 percent. Using both
poverty lines, the poverty gap for the Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils is above the average (Figure 5.16).

237. There are differences in poverty rates among Sri
Lanka’s ethnic communities. Sri Lankan Tamils and Sri
Lankan Moors constitute the two largest ethnic minority
groups and have higher levels of poverty. Using the national poverty line, Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils have
poverty rates that are 3.3 and 5.3 percentage points higher
than the Sinhala population, respectively. Using the $2.50

238. Empirical analysis finds that most of the differences in monetary poverty is related to inequality of
opportunities. The likelihood of being poor is not statistically different for ethnic minorites relative to the Sinhala majority if one controls for education, ownership of
assets,and access to services.103 Estimates from a multivariate profile of risk-of-poverty

chances of being poor compared to households where the
head has completed compulsory education. Ownership
of assets such as mobile phones, a sewing machine, or a
television lowers the probability of being poor, as does access to services, particularly having running water within
premises. Age, gender, and sector of activity of the household head, once controlling for all other covariates, are not
statistically significant in assessing the risk of poverty of an
individual. Moreover, the probability of being poor is statistically the same for Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils, once
individual, household, and locational characteristics are
controlled for. This points to the fact that most of the differences in monetary poverty have to do with inequality of
opportunities, particularly with respect to education and
access to services.

improved for all population groups, the average level of
education for Tamils is lower than that of other ethnic
groups, even when excluding the most war-affected regions. For instance, comparable data over the last decade
(excluding the North and Eastern Provinces) finds that 22
percent of Sri Lankan Tamils had less than primary education (compared to 12 percent for the Sinhalese workforce)
and only 10 percent had completed A Levels, compared
to 13 percent for the Sinhalese workforce. This has meant
that, on average, the Sinhalese workforce has had consistently higher levels of education when compared to the
Tamil or Moor workforce (Figure 5.17B).

239. Access to services is particularly low for Tamils.
For a range of indicators, the most recent household survey shows that Sri Lankan Tamil households have lower
access to basic services, --including drinking water within
their premises, the availability of a pipe borne line nearby
their house a toilet within their unit, or access to electricity
(Figure 5.17A). Despite increased spending on infrastructure across the country, this evidence points to remaining
infrastructure needs, particularly related to improving
housing services. At the same time, Sri Lankan Moors, have
higher access to basic services than the majority Sinhala
population.
240. Educational attainment is lower for the ethnic
minority workforce. While educational attainment has

241. Rates of ownership of land are also uneven
among the country’s ethnic communities. According to
the 2012/13 HIES, 88.6 percent of Sinhalese households
owned land, compared to 83.3 percent of Sri Lankan Moor
households, 73.2 percent of Sri Lankan Tamil households,
and 36.5 percent of Indian Tamil households (Figure 5.18).
The lower rates of ownership among Sri Lankan Tamils,
may be due, in part, to difficulties in restoring ownership
rights following the destruction of property registries and
loss of documentation owing to the conflict. The lower
rates of ownership among Indian Tamils reflect the continued provision of housing by many estates, although recent
years have seen cases where ownership of houses and associated plots has been transferred.
242. Empirical analysis using labor force surveys
finds no statistical differences in unemployment rates
across ethnic groups, while Sinhalese are more likely

to be employed in the public sector. Labor force participation is low and unemployment is high for Sri Lankan
Tamils and Moors, relative to the Indian Tamil and Sinhalese populations. However, much of this has to do with
individual characteristics and the locational concentration
of these populations. When focusing outside of those regions, both Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils have higher labor
force participation and employment rates relative to their
Sinhalese counterparts. This

that Indian Tamil males are

the estate sector.104 In terms of the activity across population groups, empirical analysis using the labor force surveys finds that Sinhalese workers are more likely to work
in the public sector than other ethnic groups (Figure 5.19).
This empirical result cannot be corroborated against administrative employment data because the ethnic makeup of the public service is not tracked.

243. The evidence suggests that non-Sinhalese men
are more likely to be associated with private informal-sector jobs relative to their Sinhalese counterparts. Even after controlling for individual characteristics, such as age, education, and marital status, as well as
household characteristics, such as the number of children
and the district in which they are located (Figure 5.19), ethnic minorities seem to be more likely to work in informal
jobs. Tamil men are generally more likely to work in private activities relative to their Sinhalese counterparts, and
within the private sector, Sri Lankan Tamils are more likely
to work in informal private wage work. In contrast, Indian
Tamil men are more likely to work in private wage work or
to be unemployed than to work in the public sector compared to their Sinhalese counterparts. Finally, Sri Lankan
Moor men are more likely to be informal private-sector
wage workers, informal self-employed workers, or to be
unemployed than to work in the public sector relative to
their Sinhalese counterparts. Non-Sinhalese women, in
contrast, are less likely to work as private self-employed
workers compared to their Sinhalese counterparts, while
Sri Lankan Moor women are more likely to work in the
public sector compared to their Sinhalese counterparts.
For women, there seems to be a stronger likelihood of participating in the public sector, particularly for Sri Lankan
Moors. However, this may be associated with their relatively low participation in general (see below).
244. Beyond these quantitative measures, perceptions of fairness, particularly when it comes to job opportunities, can be an important aspect in assessing

the success of efforts towards social inclusion. A perception survey carried out by the Asia Foundation (2011)
suggests that, compared to Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims are less optimistic about improvements in minority
rights and equal treatment in the government job market.
Religious minorities were also less likely to think that the
country is moving in the right direction.

Internally Displaced Persons and Returnees: An
Additional Axis of Exclusion
245. An additional dimension of exclusion across
ethnic lines concerns internally displaced persons.
The post-war period has seen the return of over 700,000
displaced persons to their place of origin in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces. Although basic material needs have
largely been met,105 returnees nonetheless face multiple
challenges in accessing shelter, food and infrastructure
and developing livelihoods. There are particular difficulties in securing land rights owing to the lack of an effective claims dispute mechanism and the loss of documentation owing to conflict and displacement. At the same
time, there is migration into the North and East of other
ethnic groups -- particularly Sinhala, some of whom were
displaced decades earlier – which creates tension over access to land. Finally, there are also a number of long-time
IDPs, comprised mainly of Sri Lankan Tamils and Moors,
who are excluded from the official statistics on IDPs and

have received lower levels of assistance. Their protracted
displacement is sometimes hidden due to factors including deregistration of IDPs based on whether one’s family
place of origin is open for return, but they still live in displacement.
246. Families returning to their place of origin in the
North are faced with problems of indebtedness. According to a mixed-methods study, which compares the
amount of debt between groups who differ only in whether they engage in housing construction, households that
engage in housing construction have significantly higher debt despite the housing assistance they received.106
About 73 percent of housing beneficiaries in the sample
reported borrowing money on top of the housing assistance provided to them. Reasons for doing so included
the desire to build larger and better houses. As most of
the returnee families engage in casual labor and lack sufficient and stable income to repay their loans, they become
indebted. In addition, Romeshun et al. (2014) argue that
most of the households lack financial literacy, such as
knowledge about interest rates, and they have poor management of grant money, which worsens their debt situation. Female-headed households and households with
disabled members are found to be particularly vulnerable.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are cases of suicides and attempted suicides linked to indebtedness.107

lenders in the Northern and Eastern Provinces (Figure 5.20)
indicates both the comparatively high levels of indebtedness as well the resort to this less institutionalized form of
money lending in these provinces. While high rates of indebtedness in the North and East do not only affect IDPs,
their particular circumstances appear to be the main driver
of the problem.
247. Local empowerment in areas with concentrations
of minorities remains an issue. Some empowerment
has occurred, notably through the holding of elections to
provincial councils and, more recently, the return of some
lands occupied by the military and the appointment of a
civilian governor to the Northern Province. While there are
reports of easing, the high number of security forces in the
conflict-affected areas has been cited as one of the main
obstacles for IDP returnees and others in rebuilding their
livelihoods and achieving durable solutions.108 Reported
continued surveillance and engagement by the military
in local economic activities also have negatively affected
IDP returnees and communities affected by the conflict.109
Settlement and implementation of a division of authority
between national, provincial, and local governments, especially in the North and East, remains an outstanding challenge. In addition, ensuring that further reconstruction and
development projects proceed in a participatory manner
will be important for inclusion.

C. Gender Inclusion
Low Female Labor Force Participation
248. Sri Lanka faces a low and slightly declining rate
of female labor force participation. Sri Lanka’s female labor participation had been stable at slightly below 40 percent for the past few decades up until the 2000s, when it
started to decline. Although participation of women in the
labor force is higher in Sri Lanka than its South Asian comparators, it is lower than comparable middle-income countries, despite decades of low

slightly declining over the last decade. Across age groups,
the drop in labor force participation rates was highest for
the youth (Figure 5.21B). To a large extent, this is due to
more young women continuing their education. In fact
this is the main reason for non-participation among young
women in 63 percent of cases in the 2012 labor force survey, up from 57.6 percent in 2002. In contrast, labor force
participation for 60 to 69 year olds has increased over time.
249. Female labor force participation rates are higher
for those with either low or high levels of education.
Women with A-levels had participation rates that were 17
percentage points higher than those with O-levels (the
next highest level of education) in 2012, and those with a
degree or more had a participation rate 36 points higher
than those with A-levels (Figure 5.21C). However, the difference in participation rates between highly educated
women and those with less education is narrowing, albeit
slowly. This is seen by the flattening of the curve in Figure 5.21C over time and holds true even when controlling
for other regional and individual characteristics. Between
2003 and 2012, the difference in the likelihood of participating declined by 8 and 7 percent for women with incomplete primary and completed primary education, respectively, relative to those with university degrees or higher.110
250. As in most countries, labor force participation is
lower for married women and for those with children.
Indeed, the labor force survey confirms that separated
or divorced women have the highest rates of labor force
participation, while participation for married and never
married females is similar (Figure 5.21D). Married women
were less likely to participate than similar single women,
who in turn were less likely to participate than separated
or divorced women once we control for age, education, regional and other individual and household characteristics,
in line with previous analysis.111 Similarly, women with children under 5 were less likely to participate. On the other
hand, the presence of other adults in the household who
presumably can take care of children is commonly found
to increase labor force participation by women. This suggests that better access to affordable quality childcare facilities could stimulate female labor force participation.112
Furthermore, marriage changes the definitions of what

251. Social norms related to women’s role in the
household and especially as related to childcare responsibilities restrict women’s opportunity to participate in the labor market. About 66 percent of women
who did not participate cited “household activities” as the

main reason for non-participation in 2012, in line with
earlier years. This is similar across urban and rural regions,
but less common for young women (who are most often
studying) and those in the estate sector (who more often
cite old age/retirement). Interestingly, 71 percent of women with higher levels of education (A levels or more) cite
“household activities” compared to 64 of cases for women with lower level of education114. Indeed, “marriage de-

fines culturally appropriate behavior beyond economic
need, individual ability, and individual preference”.115 Most
notably, once married, women traditionally carry care responsibilities for children and elderly in the household. In
a survey conducted on attitudes towards gender norms in
four districts of Sri Lanka, more than half of the male and
female respondents agreed that childcare is primarily the
mother’s responsibility and that women’s most important
role is to take care of her home and cook for the family.116
More generally, perceptions of culturally appropriate employment as opposed to the actual opportunities available may leave women unemployed.117 According to the
National Youth Survey 2013, 64 percent of young women
mention respectability as an important factor in their job
selection.118 Finally, the type of degrees completed could
play a role, especially when looking at arts degrees.119

Gender Wage Gap and Occupational Segregation
252. Beyond social norms, gender wage gaps and occupational segregation dissuade and constrain women
from participating in the labor force. Female educational achievement is higher and has been growing faster than
that of men. For instance, the O-level completion rates

were about four percentage points higher for females than
for males in 2012, reflecting a widening over the 2002-to2012 period. Despite higher levels of education for women, wages for women continue to be lower than wages for
men, with women earning 84 percent of male wages in
2012 (Figure 5.22A). Even when taking differences in the
types of jobs where men and women tend to be employed
into account, the wage gap in 2012 cannot be explained
by observable characteristics or by differences in the types
of work that men and women typically engage in. Moreover, this unexplained share has increased since 2003
(Figure 5.22B), which is likely to reduce the willingness of
women to work. As Sinha (2012) highlights, public-sector
jobs have less of a problem in this regard, with the relatively better gender parity in earnings in the public sector,
making it more attractive for women to seek employment
there. In addition, the public sector typically offers shorter
workdays – which allow working mothers and wives to attend to their household duties while maintaining the perception of respectability – as well as other monetary and
non-monetary benefits (maternity leave, vacations, sick
leave, pension benefits, etc.).
253. Discrimination in hiring practices is hard to
prove. However, a Marga Survey conducted in the 1980s,
for instance, pointed to biases against married women due
to the perceived need for extra facilities and higher costs
in the form of absenteeism and maternity leave.120 Finally,
due to a high degree of occupational segregation based

on social attitudes about appropriate jobs for women,
relatively few occupations, such as teaching, semi-skilled
and unskilled production work (often in textiles) and domestic service, are available to Sri Lankan women.121 Some
of these jobs, such as working in garment factories in free
trade zones, are associated with exploitation and stigmatization, which may deter women from entering into the labor market.122 In addition, the legal framework governing
work in the private sector prevents women from taking up
night work or part-time work in the growing service sector.123 Moreover, the laws governing maternity benefits124

123 The Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 states under
paragraph 10(2) that “a person who has attained the age of fourteen
years and who [...] is a female, shall not be employed in or about the business of a shop or office before 6 am or after 6pm on any day“. Exception
included in the act include: (i) women from the age of eighteen years may
be employed in or about the business of a hotel or restaurant for the period between 6pm and 10pm; (ii) women from the age of eighteen may be
employed in a residential hotel before 6am or after 6pm; and (iii) women
from the age of eighteen may be employed in or about the business of a
shop or office for the period between 6pm and 8pm. See Shop and Office
Employees Act accessed at: http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/1350/

124 Maternity benefits in Sri Lanka’s private sector are governed by
the Maternity Benefits Ordinance No. 32 of 1939 (for women employed
in any trade) and the Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 (for
women employed in shops and offices) (Abeykoon et al. 2014). In 1993,
Sri Lanka ratified the ILO Maternity Protection Convention (Revised) 1952
(No. 103). However, there remain shortcomings between the national
legislation and the ILO convention (see Abeykoon et al. (2014: 13). One
of the shortcomings is that maternity benefit payments are financed
through employer liability. It is commonly argued that employer liability
for maternity benefits lead to discrimination of women who are pregnant

make employers bear the entire cost, potentially deterring
employers from hiring women.125
254. Finally, there are notable differences in female
labor force participation among provinces and ethnic groups (Figure 5.23). Participation in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces is particularly low at 26.2 percent
and 23.6 percent, respectively. The special circumstances
for women due to war and effects of the 2004 tsunami in
these regions – including high levels of gender-based violence and early marriage to war widowers – may contribute to the problem. Indian Tamil women are much more
likely to participate in the labor force – their participation
rate lies at 55 percent – and the participation by Sri Lankan Moor women is lowest, at 16.2 percent. While the high
participation rate by Indian Tamil women can be explained
by their location in the estate sector and the special labor
conditions there, cultural and social norms in the household are likely to play a key role in determining the labor
force participation of Sri Lankan Moor women.126

been through migration, which poses particular inclusion challenges. A significant body of literature focuses

256. Women’s migration has impacts on the family
that is left behind, most notably on the children in the
household, with implications for society more broadly. In the absence of the mother, the extended family and
husbands take up care responsibilities for children in female migrant households.131 With the primary care giver
being absent, children are sometimes found to be more
exposed to abuse, including sexual abuse and incest.132
Poor financial management at home can put the benefits
of migration at risk. Some studies find the educational performance and attendance of children of migrant mothers
to be lower.133 Upon the return of the migrating mother,
family relationships are often disrupted due to the long
absence of the mother, her exposure to a different context, her newly gained economic power deriving from her
income and changing the power dynamics at home, and
the non-acceptance of all this by other family members,
especially by spouses.134 This can ultimately lead to the
separation of spouses, additionally impacting children’s
opportunities. In response to the realization of these potential social costs of migrating mothers, the government
has put in place regulations, including minimum age re-

on the well being of female migrants outside Sri Lanka and
the situation of the families they leave behind.127 While
the share of women in departures for foreign employment has declined overall since the mid-1990s, women
still constituted 49 percent of departures in 2012.128 Out of
the women migrating for foreign employment in 2012, 86
percent were to be employed as housemaids. Most female
migrants are married, have children and come from lower
income groups.129 Poverty, lack of employment in Sri Lanka
with adequate wages, the desire to improve the economic status of their families (including building a permanent
home and acquiring land), better education for their children, and overcoming economic difficulties like indebtedness are often cited as reasons for women’s departures.130

quirements for mother and child, insurance schemes and
scholarships for children of migrant workers.135

Women in Leadership Roles
257. Women are under-represented in political life.
Sri Lanka boasts having produced the world’s first woman prime minister in 1960, and women have been enjoying the right to vote since 1931. However, despite the fact
that women make up nearly 53 percent of the population,
they are under-represented in political and public decision-making bodies. Women make up only 5.8 percent of
parliamentarians in the current National Parliament, 4.1
percent in Provincial Councils and a negligible 1.8 percent
in local government, among the lowest in the world, and
certainly in South Asia.136 The percentage of women in
parliament between the 1930s and the present has never
exceeded 7 percent (Figure 5.24). A shift in 1989 to an electoral system based on proportional representation, which
elsewhere has generally proven more favorable to women,
has not led to a significant change in the numbers of women elected over the years.
258. Women are also under-represented on private-sector boards. Ratwatte (2012) noted that of the
country’s 25 top corporate entities, which have a total of
198 directors, only 10 are women.137 Although women on

Sri Lankan corporate boards are valued for what they can
contribute and in every sense are considered no less equal
to the job than their male counterparts, they take only 5
percent of leadership roles in the private sector. Similarly,
a study using 2009 data found that only 13 percent of top
management positions in nine commercial banks in Sri
Lanka are held by women.138

D. Priorities on Inclusion
259. The significant locational concentration of monetary poverty in urban areas points to harnessing the
urbanization process to benefit the poor and the bottom 40 percent. The highest numbers of people living
in poverty and the bottom 40 percent are located within
multi-city agglomeration areas and can benefit from efforts to increase competitiveness discussed in Chapter IV.
Providing for effective governance of cities to allow for responsiveness to changing social and economic conditions
and addressing inclusion challenges will be important.
Local officials will need to have sufficient administrative
authority, financial resources and capacity to delivery services and conduct integrated, strategic planning. An empowered local government could be more responsive to
addressing gaps in service delivery and infrastructure, particularly in addressing connectivity and other constraints
to agglomeration that will affect the bottom 40 percent’s
ability to secure good jobs.
260. Key priorities to address the inclusion challenges across space, ethnicity and gender include concerted efforts to reduce poverty, improve public-service
provision and promote employment opportunities in

138

Gunawaredena, Kennedy (2010).

the North, East, Moneragala, and the estates. Multi-sector interventions that address lack of job opportunities in
the North and East would help to reduce poverty and ensure shared prosperity. This could include small works programs aimed at improving market accessibility, incentives
to promote entrepreneurship among educated youth and
direct programs to help ex-combatants and female-headed households would go a long way to ensuring inclusion
of the most vulnerable. In the estates, multi-sector interventions to improve nutrition outcomes, enhance job opportunities for the youth and prepare for a growing number of aging estate workers would help in ensuring their
inclusion in shared growth.
261. Concerted efforts need to be continued to improve equality of opportunity across ethnic groups, regardless of where these populations reside. This mainly
requires an improvement in job opportunities for ethnic
minorities. However, it also points to the need to address
land claims in the former conflict areas, providing assistance to new and “old” IDPs, equalizing assistance to widows whose families are victims of the conflict regardless
of which side they were on and integrated efforts to assist
ex-combatants. These efforts, in addition to improved social protection systems (Chapter III) and better job opportunities (Chapter IV), will help to provide equality of opportunity and foster inclusion.
262. Critical emphasis is needed on increasing labor
force participation of women and ensuring that they
enjoy equal opportunity accessing jobs as well as political and private sector leadership positions. Priorities in
this area include improving women’s education and incentives for participation through a better alignment of the
education women pursue and the demands of the market;
reforming legislation that prevents or deters women from
being hired; and fostering greater participation of women
in leadership positions.

Sustaining Sri Lanka’s Development
263. The prospects for progress towards eradicating
poverty and promoting shared prosperity depend on
the sustainability of Sri Lanka’s impressive development trajectory. As with any country, there are risks that
external or internal conditions that have facilitated progress to date do not continue to hold true. There are also
risks of the emergence of new factors that can meaningfully impact progress.
264. Some key risks in Sri Lanka’s recent pattern of
growth and progress towards the twin goals have already materialized and are important constraints
reviewed in previous sections. These risks include the
challenges of sustaining growth based on internal consumption growth and increased public investment; the fiscal challenge of declining revenues and increasing needs
for investment in human and physical capital; the lack of
diversification and the need to develop a more competitive, open economy that encourages formality and innovation; and providing for equality of opportunity and inclusion of all segments of the population. Risks to social
sustainability – in particular higher levels of disaffection
coupled with higher unemployment and levels of distrust
in government among the youth – are evident in the inclusion section. For the most part, these areas reflect the
manner in which government policies have shaped the
contours of the country’s economy and opportunities for
its citizens.
265. There are four other issues important to sustainability and fundamental to continued progress. The
first area is the necessity to achieve a lasting settlement
that ensures peace and security for Sri Lankans. This is
the sine qua non condition for progress. The second area
involves the challenges inherent in the major institutional

VI. Sustainability

overhaul now taking place. The third area is economic stability in the context of the external environment. Finally,
Sri Lanka will continue to face environmental challenges,
particularly the risk of climate change.

A. Social Risks to Sustainability
Peace and Security
266. Global experience indicates that countries that
have recently been in internal conflict are much more
prone to outbreaks of new conflict, suggesting that Sri
Lanka is an “at risk” country. The 2011 World Development Report found nine out of 10 outbreaks of new conflicts in the 2000s occurred in countries that had recently
previously experienced conflict and all civil wars that occurred since 2003 occurred in countries that previously had been in civil war. Of course, every country has its
unique circumstances that may or may not make it vulnerable to conflict. In Sri Lanka’s particular case, the combatants who challenged the state in previous decades – the
LTTE and, earlier, leftist groups in the south – are no longer
direct threats following their comprehensive defeat or integration into the political mainstream. However, the lack
of an evident armed threat at present does not ensure no
new outbreak of conflict in the future. Having won the war,
Sri Lanka needs to secure the peace.
267. The quantum of impact from conflict makes it
a serious risk even if the likelihood of a new outbreak
appears low. Conflict inflicts direct and indirect costs at
national, local and personal levels and lack of security undermines the well-being of all Sri Lankans. As noted earlier
in Chapter II, one estimate of the cost of Sri Lanka’s internal
conflicts was nearly 5 percent of GDP from 1978 to 2002.
Conflict would impair the country’s ability to address the

constraints outlined above, from dealing with the fiscal
challenge to diversification of the economy.
268. Sri Lanka’s Commission of Inquiry on Lessons
Learned and Reconciliation (LLRC) identified in 2011 a
broad array of steps to achieve reconciliation among
the country’s communities. These steps focus on: ensuring rule of law; addressing citizens’ grievances; devolving
power; upholding language policy allowing for official use
of multiple languages; providing for equality of opportunity; and strengthening inter-communal and inter-personal ties. Most important, political consensus to work
towards reconciliation by political leaders representing all
communities, in and outside of government, is needed to
underpin these efforts. These recommendations are consonant with successful experience in breaking the cycle of
violence in other countries, namely the need for rebuilding confidence in the state by providing an institutional
framework that provides citizens with security, justice, and
jobs.139
269. Much has been done to implement LLRC recommendations but much remains to be done. The government carried out a far-reaching program of resettlement of
those displaced by conflict:
demilitarization,
rehabiliMuch has been done tation and reintegration of
to implement LLRC ex-combatants; de-mining
of nearly all land; and rapid
recommendations reconstruction of social and
but much remains to connective infrastructure
by conflict. Progbe done destroyed
ress in these areas has been
substantial in the short six
years since the end of the war, though infrastructure and
other public goods that provide for equality of opportunity are still at lower levels than the rest of the country. Other
issues have been partially addressed. These include implementing a trilingual public service policy and holding Eastern and Northern Provincial Council elections, as well as
organizing North-South exchange programs for students
and civil society and making efforts to recruit Tamil-speaking local police officers.
270. There have been recent renewed efforts to promote inter-communal harmony. Since the change of
government in January 2015, several steps have been taken to address Tamil grievances, such as quickly moving to
appoint a civilian governor, expediting domestic mechanisms to address accountability in connection with allegations of crimes during the conflict, and, more slowly, re-

leasing land used by the military in the North and East. The
new president was elected with the tacit support of the
leading Tamil party and contains leaders from the main
Muslim parties. Symbolic steps have been taken, including
having Tamil party leaders participate in national celebrations for the first time in decades. An international inquiry
into accountability issues delayed its reporting in recognition of the policy intent and steps undertaken by the
government to address reconciliation. There have been
no notable episodes of inter-communal violence since the
new government was elected.
271. Yet challenges remain to achieving lasting reconciliation. A political settlement on the institutional
framework that addresses issues of voice of local communities is still to be worked out. In particular, incoherence
in the assignment of powers between the central government and provincial government is a source of continuing
tension in the North. There is still a large, albeit lessening,
military presence that interferes with localities through its
surveillance, economic activities, and occupation of land.
There has been little progress towards closure on social
justice, particularly accountability in connection with allegations of crimes committed during the conflict, as well
as resolution of cases of disappearances. The sensitivity of
this issue is heightened by the considerable international
attention it attracts. Equality of opportunity that will provide the conditions for citizens of all communities to find
rewarding jobs is critical to inclusion. While there has been
progress in recent years, there is still a gap in opportunities, particularly in more rural, isolated areas. Sustained efforts will be needed to address these sensitive issues.

Other Social Risks
272. High levels of unemployment for youth – particularly educated youth – pose risks to social sustainability. Declining employment prospects for youth can lead
to frustration and ultimately, tensions.140 Youth seeking
government jobs frequently report the influence of social
networks in obtaining them. In the National Youth Survey 2013, 54.4 percent pointed to “political connections”
and 30 percent to “family connections” in obtaining public-sector employment, signaling an uneven playing field
and causing exclusion. In the past, frustrations with social
hierarchy, patronage systems and the unavailability of appropriate employment opportunities are argued to have
played a role in tumult involving large numbers of youth
in Sri Lanka since the early 1970s.141 The same youth survey points to pessimistic views about the political situation

of the country and low trust towards public institutions
among other issues; in 2013, 89 percent said they have little trust in political parties, up sharply from 47 percent in
1999-2000.142 Continuing disparities in income, consumption and access to services, which affect ethnic minorities
and create mutual suspicion, can constitute another risk to
cohesion. Finally, displacement resulting from conflict and
natural disasters has created tensions around land.143 With
the return of IDPs, land ownership is contested between
returnees and late occupants. In several conflict-affected
areas, land rights are being used as a tool to promote political patronage. This can exacerbate inter-ethnic tensions,
particularly in areas where minority communities long displaced are returning.144 Land disputes can also threaten
to undermine the relations between government officials
and communities.145

Institutional Change
273. The 19th Constitutional Amendment reflects consensus to reducing the powers of the presidency, but is
a major overhaul in the country’s institutional framework and will require a period of adjustment. The passage of the 19th Amendment in April 2015 creates stronger accountability mechanisms through the introduction
of a presidential-parliamentary form of government and
strengthening the autonomy and role of independent
commissions. Additional reforms are expected to institute a right to information regime and strengthened audit
and procurement oversight mechanisms. There is a large
degree of political consensus around the need to reduce
the perceived excessive concentration of power in the
presidency and lack of accountability and transparency.
Enacting these institutional changes was a core campaign
promise, which helped secure President Sirisena’s election in January 2015. Despite contentious debate, the 19th
Amendment eventually was nearly unanimously adopted
by Parliament. Notwithstanding this consensus and the
goal of ensuring greater accountability, it remains to be
seen how the new framework will operate. There will be a
“working in” period as the newly formed Cabinet and independent commissions undertake their roles in a changed
institutional framework.

and was widely thought likely to continue for several more
years. Public servants and entrepreneurs alike had adapted to the policies, institutional framework and governance
style of the previous government, and will need to adjust
to new circumstances.

B. Economic Risks to Sustainability
External Risks
275. Achieving a more sustainable external position
will require a heavier emphasis on direct investment
and long-term private sector flows. In line with the analysis presented in Chapter IV, recent external debt sustainability analysis146 has highlighted potential vulnerabilities
to external sustainability including: (i) a chronic current account deficit and relatively low reserve adequacy metrics;
(ii) a gradual but steady decline in goods exports as a share
of GDP; (iii) a similar decline in Sri Lanka’s share of world
exports; (iv) an already high external debt burden and a
rising cost for external financing as Sri Lanka shifts to middle-income status and bilateral concessional debt is replaced with borrowing on commercial terms; and (v) modest increases in foreign direct investment, which would
otherwise alleviate the need for debt financing. While the
current account deficit has decreased in recent years, it remains financed largely by debt-creating inflows and central bank foreign exchange reserves are at the lower end of
what is considered adequate by standard metrics.
276. With the country’s shift to middle-income status,
concessional borrowing sources are drying up and are
being replaced by borrowing on commercial terms.
The authorities have been successful in tapping international markets consistently with sovereign bond issues
and lengthening the average maturity of the debt portfolio.147 Between 2007 and 2014, the government sold USD
7 billion of sovereign bonds. As a result of increased commercial borrowings, the non-concessional and commercial
component of the government foreign debt rose from 1
percent in 2000 to 50 percent in 2013. Recently, the banking sector was also borrowing overseas at relatively high
yields.148

274. Any such major change is complex and affects
the interests of many who may respond in unexpected
ways. The prior government was in power for nine years

277. Beyond the fiscal and external risks
pointed out throughout this report, an aging population will strain public and external
finances in the long term. Sri Lanka is in the
midst of its demographic transition, and is projected to age fast in the next few decades. The
elderly dependency ratio reached its minimum
in the 1970s and 1980s and, thanks to increases
in life expectancy, has been rising steadily since
then. Under likely population projection scenarios, the elderly dependency ratio is set to rise
further to about 25 percent by 2020, and could
then stabilize around 33 percent under the nochange scenario or rise to 99 percent under the
low-fertility scenario (Figure 6.1). Private-sector
savings are expected to fall, as the elderly draw
down their savings, while increased current fiscal expenditure on aging (health, pensions, and
long-term care) will negatively affecting public-sector savings. As a result, the already low
national savings rate would further undermine
the negative savings-investment balance.

278. Population aging will likely impact the
fiscal accounts through three channels: tax
revenue, fiscal expenditure, and GDP growth. In the
absence of a tax reform, a decline in the labor force will
lead to falling revenue from income tax. An increase in the
share of elderly will lead to higher expenditure on pensions, health and long-term care, much of which would be
expected to be covered by the national budget. There may
be savings in education expenditure to the extent that
only the young receive education, though from the perspective of improving educational outcomes to increase
Sri Lanka’s competitiveness, more public expenditure on
education may be needed instead. The combination of falling income taxes and increased expenditures will lead to
persistent deficits and consequent accumulation of public
debt. Increased debt, in turn, will lead to further increases
in expenditure through interest payments. Finally, a slowdown in labor growth and potentially lower investment (as
discussed above) will lead to a slowdown in GDP growth,
which will worsen the capacity of the economy to sustain
high debt. There may also be feedback effects, where government fiscal policy may affect the decision of the elderly
whether to retire or stay in the labor force.
279. Moreover, Sri Lanka is relatively older and poorer compared to other countries facing an aging population. Sri Lanka is already a relatively old country, especially compared to other South Asian countries, although
its population is still younger than countries in Europe and
Central Asia and a number of middle-income East Asian

countries (Figure 6.2A). The projected share of 60+ in total
population as of 2015 is 13.4 percent, but the share of elderly is projected to increase
to 25.7 percent of total population by 2050, an increase Sri Lanka faces a
of 12.3 percentage points. Sri challenge to “get rich
Lanka is also relatively poor
given its age. Compared to before getting old”
other Asian countries with a
similar elderly dependency ratio, Sri Lanka’s GDP per capita is low; hence there is urgency to “get rich before getting old.” Moreover, Sri Lanka’s social expenditure (most of
which is age-related) is relatively small compared to other
similar-age countries. As shown earlier, expenditure on
health is relatively low and has been declining over time
(Figure 6.2B). Expenditure on pensions is 1.4 percent of
GDP -- reflecting its limited scope, which comprises only
retired public-sector workers.
280. Between now and 2060, the elderly dependency ratio is projected to rise sharply, while the young
dependency ratio is projected to fall. The population is
projected to peak in the mid-2040s before starting to fall
(Figure 6.3). Life expectancy at birth has increased from 60
years for the cohort born in 1960 to 74 years for the 2012
cohort. The share of the population above 60 will increase
from 13 percent to 27 percent by 2060 under the medium-fertility scenario.

VI. Sustainability

281. Illustrative simulations of the long-term impact
of aging on the fiscal accounts can help shed light on
the constraints and policy space available to the government.149 A baseline scenario of no tax reform and a policy of bringing public health and education expenditure
to levels closer to other middle-income countries would
lead to a steady rise in primary (non-interest) expenditure
from 14 percent of GDP in 2013 to 20 percent of GDP by
2060. This widening primary deficit combined with a slowing GDP growth would lead to a rapidly growing level of
public debt-to-GDP from 78 percent of GDP at end-2013
surpassing 150 percent of GDP within two decades. Interest payments would form the majority of public spending,
which would be clearly unsustainable.

149 Simulations based on publicly available information by Bank staff
available upon request. These simulations do not constitute official World
Bank projections. While the current numbers are based on actual data as
of end-2013, the projected numbers are based on simple projections of
the tax base (revenue) and projected trends in demographics and cost
inflation (expenditure). It should be noted that these simulations do not
take into account the fact that many (informal sector) workers are not
covered by neither the public nor the private sector pension scheme, and
in the future there may be pressure to extend coverage to those workers
as well. Neither do they it include possible future public expenditure on
long-term care.

282. Public policy action may help avert this scenario
through tax reforms and increasing the retirement age
in line with rising life expectancy. With only about 4

expenditure, contain force
pay income tax. For other
the fiscal deficit, and taxes, there is also scope to
put public debt back gradually but persistently
widen the tax base, reduce
on a declining path exemptions and improve tax
collection (Chapter III). A major tax reform that would gradually lift revenue to 22 percent of GDP over time could offset the projected increase
in expenditure on education, health and public-sector
pensions sufficiently to achieve a primary surplus and contain the fiscal deficit, and put public debt back on a declining path.
283. Extending the retirement age could temporarily
boost GDP growth, but its impact would not be enough
to reverse the debt dynamics, due to inertia in the labor market and demographics. Gradually extending the
retirement age for public-sector workers could help stabilize public pension expenditure, but it would have only a
small effect on labor market dynamics and GDP growth.
Due to inertia, it would not fix the fiscal deficit as fast as
tax reform would. If people work longer across the board,
it would temporarily reverse the declining labor force and
income-tax revenue as more people would enter than exit
during the transition. This temporary boost to GDP and
revenue would make the debt dynamics look more favorable, but it would not make it sustainable by itself.
284. Any reform of this nature will be politically sensitive and needs to be gradual, but delaying reform will
force more painful actions to be taken later. Tax reform
will not increase tax revenue at once, and such reforms will
face political economy challenges. However, the sooner
tax revenue increases, the more space there will be for expenditure later. Similarly, increases in the retirement age
can be implemented only slowly, so preparation has to
start soon.

dition of conservation dating back over 2,000 years when
ancient edicts called for the preservation of wildlife in defined areas. Its extraordinary variety of landscapes and biodiversity is today relatively unaffected with low levels of
air, water, and land pollution. For instance, its air quality is
the best in South Asia, in large part thanks to its effective
vehicle emissions control system, though the anticipated
doubling of private vehicle traffic between 2010 and 2020
and an increase in use of coal for power generation will
pose an increasing challenge. Sri Lanka’s natural assets
provide for high levels of livability and contribute to Sri
Lanka’s attractiveness for tourism.
286. However, there are environmental challenges to
be managed. There has been an increase in arable land
due to the expansion of agriculture at a rate of 2.7 percent
per year between 2006 and 2011, the years for which information is available150. Correspondingly there has been a
reduction in forest cover from 33.2 percent in 2000 to 29.7
percent in 2010 (which does not take into account likely
losses in the conflict affected north). Sri Lanka had the
fifth highest rate of deforestation (15 percent) in the world
during the period 2000-2005, with consequences for watersheds and soil loss, and leading to a panoply of economic and environmental damages. A recent 2010 World
Bank study found that
economic losses from
land and environmental Economic losses from
degradation far exceed land and environmental
(by orders of magnitude)
the revenue from agri- degradation far
culture, suggesting that exceed revenue from
limits to land conversion expansion of agriculture,
have likely been reached.
This has contributed to suggesting that limits
high and rising levels of to land conversion have
species extinction; according to a recent sur- been reached
vey, 33 percent of inland
vertebrate fauna and 61 percent of its flora are nationally
threatened. Fresh water resources are at risk due to encroachment that occurs in the absence of adequate watershed planning and enforcement.

C. Environmental Risks to
Sustainability

287. Soil conservation is critical for agricultural productivity and particularly for poorer households who
are most dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. The clearing of forests for new lands that cause increased runoff and siltation rates in steeply sloped lands as
well as intensive farming practices are linked to declining
productivity. The Global Assessment of Soil Degradation

285. Sri Lanka has a significant advantage in its rich
natural asset base that can be a long-term contributor
to growth and quality of life. The country has a rich tra-

suggests that nearly 33 percent of Sri Lanka’s land area
is severely or very severely degraded in terms of reduced
agricultural productivity. A Bank study found that the potential cost savings of better nutrient management is between US$50 million to 100 million over a 20-year period,
suggesting high economic returns to soil conservation.
288. Protection of watersheds is vital for agricultural irrigation, domestic water use, flood attenuation,
forestry, fishing, recreation and other services to the
population and environment. The total annual value of
watershed services in the Southern Province is estimated
to range from US$2,128 per hectare (ha) in the Muthurajawela Marsh to US$12,494 for mangrove forests and to
US$622,845 for coral reefs. In contrast, the estimate by
the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) of the average annual global value of watershed benefits stands at
US$3,274/ha. Moreover, the average revenue from paddy
cultivation in Sri Lanka is estimated at only US$750/ha.
Thus the payoffs from watershed benefits far exceed the
marginal financial returns from paddy cultivation – the default option in agriculture. Protection of water resources is
also vitally important for human health. There are strong
indications that chronic kidney disease, a disease afflicting
over 10,000 persons, stems from high chemical concentrations in domestic and irrigation water supply151.
289. Sri Lanka’s solid waste management challenge
is linked to the rapid pace of urbanization. Waste generation is characterized by distinct geographic patterns in
Sri Lanka, with higher volumes being generated in more
prosperous urban areas and provinces. Collection rates average 31 percent whereas other middle-income countries
have average collection rates of 68 percent.152 The bulk of
waste is organic, suggesting there is scope for reducing
the pollution load of wastes requiring ultimate disposal,
and for employment generation through complementary
composting activities. Poor management of solid wastes
in Sri Lanka is a direct consequence of under-investment
and corresponding policies. A 2011 World Bank study
identified a funding gap that is estimated to rise to LKR 1.6
billion ($16 million) by 2015 and a further LKR. 4.2 billion
($42 million) by 2020.
290. Sri Lanka will be well served in seeking to obtain environmentally, socially and economically equitable growth – or green growth -- now and long into
the future, especially in urban areas. The large Colombo metropolitan region in particular will need to balance
these priorities in order to have sustainable urban growth

green financing. This will involve seeking to allocate public
funding and crowd in private-sector funding in pursuit of
green growth as well as institutional capacity. An important part of capacity would involve the ability to assess the
value of sustainable benefits as well as a monitoring, reporting, and verification methodology.
291. The human-elephant conflict exemplifies environmental sustainability challenges. Protected areas
are of insufficient size and quality to sustain the country’s
elephant population as evidenced by data showing that
over two-thirds of the wild elephant population can be
found outside the protected area system. Wild elephants
are compelled to graze on agricultural lands to survive, resulting in a vicious spiral of conflict with agriculturalists.
This has reached alarming proportions in many parts of
the dry zone in Sri Lanka, with around 70 humans and over
200 elephants killed annually due to the conflict. With increased development and the inevitable erosion of habitats, the problem is set to worsen unless immediate remedial action is taken.
292. In addition to imperatives to have growth be
green, the country will need to manage disaster risks.
Sri Lanka’s has a disaster
risk profile characterized by

several factors, including climate change discussed below (though impacts cannot be assessed with specificity),
as well as land usage patterns that lead to greater vulnerability. Annual average disaster loss is estimated to be USD
380 million, with floods accounting for an annual expected
loss of USD 240 million. Legislation calls for the establishment of a Disaster Fund as an insurance mechanism, but
de facto disaster-related expenditure is provided in an ad
hoc manner through supplementary budget allocations.
Although the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is the designated insurer for public assets like infrastructure, there is very little insurance of private property

(less than 1 percent of residential property is insured), and
crop insurance is not widespread either.153 The government is working to improve relevant data collection and
develop a national disaster risk financing strategy. It is also
looking to link with social protection benefit distribution
programs to provide benefits quickly to deal with disaster
impacts, though this hinges on overall improvement of
the social protection system.

Climate Change
293. The country will be exposed to long-term effects
of climate change. Model simulations under different scenarios indicate a significant past warming trend of about
0.75°C per century in annual mean temperatures over the
South Asia region.154 Future temperature projections indicate a steady increase in temperatures across the three
periods, with anomalies reaching 4°C–5°C for high-emission scenarios by the 2080s. Warming will be widespread
throughout the region by end of the 21st century. Spatial
patterns of rainfall change indicate future increases over
eastern and northeastern areas.
294. Low-end estimates show Sri Lanka suffering a
1.2 percent loss of annual GDP by 2050 due to climate
change, even if measures are taken to address it.155 Changes of temperature and rainfall variation will directly impact

many sectors of the economy, including power, transport,
agriculture and aquaculture, with further impacts on
health, human settlements, and tourism. Climate change
will lead to more occurrences of natural disasters, such as
droughts, floods and landslides, due to extreme weather events.156 Much of the impact will be on agricultural
yields, with a decline in rice yield of as much as 23 percent
by 2080 (Table 6.1). Farming districts with heavy reliance
on primary agriculture, few infrastructural and socioeconomic assets (or low adaptive capacity), and high level of
exposure to historical hazards are the most vulnerable.157
The vulnerability of rice crops to droughts is expected to
increase, especially in the dry and intermediate zones. Tea
plantations at low and medium elevations are more vulnerable to impacts of climate change than those at high
elevations. Reduction of monthly rainfall by 100 mm could
reduce productivity by 30–80 kg of tea per hectare.158
Extended dry spells and excessive cloudiness during the
wet season can reduce coconut yield, with annual losses
of US$32 million to US$73 million. However, during a high
rainfall year, the economy could gain by US$42 million to
US$87 million due to high coconut yields. Future projections on coconut yield suggest that production after 2040
may not be sufficient to cater to local consumption.159

295. Marine and coastal areas are projected to be similarly affected. Sri Lanka’s coastal region covers about 23
percent of the island’s land area.160 It also accommodates
about 25 percent of the population, and includes a heavy
concentration of urban areas, tourism infrastructure and
industries that are vulnerable to the impact of sea level rise
and increased frequency of storms and the intensification
of coastal erosion due to climate change (Figure 6.4). The
impacts on marine and coastal areas have been observed
in the alteration of ocean circulation, coral reef ecosystems, ocean and estuarine salinity, fisheries and recreation
and tourism activities. The effects also include dryland and
wetland losses, which impose both physical and economic
risks on coastal communities.
296. Climate change will impact other areas, such as
availability of water, energy, public health. The availability of irrigation water is highly vulnerable, especially in
the dry zone, due to the increase in droughts and the high
dependence of agriculture. Vulnerability of drinking water
to drought is also widespread. The South/South Central,
North Western, and North Central regions of the country
are particularly vulnerable. Drinking water vulnerability to
floods is prevalent in many areas of the country. Such areas have limited access to piped water and rely heavily on
groundwater, resulting in high incidence of water-borne
diseases.161 Second, hydropower generation will be impacted over time. Annual average rainfall has decreased
over the last 57 years at about 7 mm per year, resulting

in water scarcities in the dry zone.162 Third, climate and
anomalous weather events are expected to cause a general increase in the number of cases of both vector- and
water-borne diseases. The region’s mortality rate – influenced by dengue, malaria and diarrhea – would increase
over time as a consequence of climate change. Morbidity
and deaths from such diseases could increase in the future
under all scenarios.163

D. Priorities on Sustainability
297. Sustaining peace and security through sustained
reconciliation among Sri Lanka’s heterogenous communities is a sine qua non for progress towards the twin
goals. Closure regarding difficult chapters in Sri Lanka’s
past is needed to forestall the possibility of new tensions
emerging. Governments at all levels will need to maintain
focus on overcoming issues among the country’s ethnic
communities that have fueled past violence. This will likely
include sustained implementation of mechanisms to address these issues, including domestic mechanisms for assessing accountability as well as following through on the
many LLRC recommendations. It also calls for consistent
consideration of promoting inclusion and reconciliation
across all public programs.
298. Sustaining momentum to carry through with
institutional and political reforms will be needed to

ensure government effectiveness and stability. At the
time of writing this SCD, the new institutional framework
embodied in the 19th Amendment has not yet been implemented. Electoral reforms have not yet been finalized and
legislation regarding right to information and the audit
function are awaiting consideration in Parliament. August
2015 general elections have led to the formation of a new
government, which is now setting policies for the coming
years. There will need to be sustained commitment by
Sri Lanka’s political leaders to carrying through with the
new model, overcoming any transitional issues that may
emerge, and providing for smooth operation of government.
299. A heavier emphasis on direct investment and
long-term private-sector flows will be needed to sustain Sri Lanka’s external fiscal position. Past reliance
on remittances and external borrowing to maintain the
country’s balance of payments will become harder to sustain. Remittances are likely to remain at comparable levels
while there is limited scope for continued borrowing, since
it will be at commercial rates and the country’s low revenue-to-debt ratios. FDI is important for competitiveness
but also to help with balance of payments.

300. Long-term sustainability concerns related to an
aging population need to be addressed sooner rather
than later. Having passed its demographic peak, Sri Lanka
faces an urgency to get rich before it gets old. In addition
to addressing the present acute fiscal challenge, tax reform
to structurally increase fiscal revenue over the long term is
needed to create room for increased public expenditure
on education, health and pensions. Increasing the retirement age in line with increasing life expectancy would also
help temporarily reverse the decline in the labor force.
301. Sri Lanka will be well served in seeking to ensure environmentally sustainable growth and better
manage disaster risk. This could include soil conservation efforts, protection of watersheds, and improved solid
waste management. This will require holistic, long-term
planning across sectors, coordination among stakeholders, and seeking to allocate public funding and crowd in
private-sector funding in pursuit of green growth. In addition, a national disaster risk financing strategy will be
needed, along with better integration of disaster relief
with social protection benefit distribution programs.

|

VII. Conclusions

Identifying a Path Forward
302. Sri Lanka’s development trajectory has shown
impressive gains but there are strong indications that
drivers of past progress are not sustainable. The country has experienced strong growth and a rapid reduction
in poverty over the past decade. It has ended a 30-year
debilitating internal conflict and rapidly addressed many
of the needs of the conflict-affected population. It has just
gone through a remarkable democratic transition and has
embarked on far-reaching institutional reforms to provide
for greater effectiveness and probity of government. Its
human development outcomes remain impressive, even
if continued improvement is becoming more challenging. However, the country’s inward-looking growth model
based on non-tradable sectors and domestic demand amplified by public investment cannot be expected to lead to
sustained inclusive growth going forward.
303. The systematic diagnostic set out in this report points to fiscal, competitiveness, and inclusion
challenges as well as governance and sustainability
cross-cutting challenges as priority areas of focus for
sustaining progress in ending poverty and promoting
shared prosperity. These overarching challenges were
identified through the SCD’s systematic “leave-no-stoneunturned” review of the many possible factors that constrain or drive progress on the twin goals (Box 7.1). The
identified challenges represent an aggregate of discrete
constraints identified by the analysis, filtered by five criteria: the potential impact on twin goals, the time horizon for
this impact, strength of the evidence base, complementarities, and whether addressing the constraint is a precondition for dealing with other constraints. The extent to
which criteria have been met is derived from observation
of where Sri Lanka’s current performance falls below that
of appropriate comparator countries (mainly in South and
Southeast Asia) and/or the country’s own past, and where
Sri Lankan stakeholders have identified major issues over
the course of drafting the SCD. The resulting list of areas
may not be an exhaustive tracking of all of the country’s
development challenges, but it sets out what is most significant in relation to the twin goals.

Priority Areas of Focus to End Poverty and
Promote Shared Prosperity in a Sustainable Way
304. The fiscal challenge is marked above all by constraints brought about by poor revenue collection.
Chronically disappointing revenue performance and the
persistently narrow tax base despite growth is a first order
issue. Continued strong commitment to fiscal sustainability urgently requires long-term domestic revenue mobiliza-

tion efforts. This diagnostic identifies a range of tax administration and policy issues that may be driving low revenue
performance, but substantial additional analysis into many
areas, most notably tax exemptions and enforcement,
is required. Greater effectiveness and efficiency on the
expenditure side through improvements in public-sector management can also help increase fiscal space. Ultimately, more fiscal space is a precondition for addressing
other constraints. Low revenue has led to a lean and rigid
budget where low levels of public spending on health,
education and social protection undercut Sri Lanka’s past
strong gains in human development and leave it less well
equipped to face changing human development needs as
a MIC. This is especially important in light of the need to
reduce inequality of opportunity and invest in skills to enhance competitiveness. Beyond increasing fiscal space for
these priority projects, there is room to improve efficiency
of spending on social protection and public-sector personnel management that undermines the effectiveness of the
state. Reducing fragmentation and improving targeting of
the existing social protection system can ensure that every
dollar spent on social protection has a maximum impact in
reducing poverty.164 Similarly, improving controls on public-sector remuneration and reducing political influence in
civil service management could substantially improve the
efficiency of public-service delivery.
305. The competitiveness challenge involves many
areas where Sri Lanka can improve performance, with
improving the skill sets of the labor force emerging as
a major constraint for growth and good jobs for the
bottom 40 percent. Sri Lanka’s educational system, particularly at tertiary levels, is not providing a sufficient volume of workers of the quality and skills demanded by the
market. This, in part, reflects low public spending on the
area, but also points to bottlenecks in expanding the availability of university slots, and the adequacy and quality of
the curricula. Efforts in this regard could include steps to
ensure: high-quality general education and development
of soft skills; greater private-sector participation in higher education, improvements in technical and vocational training; better coordination with potential employer
needs; and that youth are inclined to pursue degrees in the
industries where demand is the highest.
306. Trade policy and a host of land, labor and other
regulatory barriers further hamper the country’s development. It will be important to review and revise the
country’s trade-related policies, including the para-tariff
regime to encourage more foreign trade, simplify the VAT
and corporate income tax regimes, and reduce or elimi-

Box 7.1 Approach to prioritization
This Systematic Country Diagnostic was compiled in three phases: (i) a comprehensive gathering and review of existing evidence
of constraints and factors towards progress on ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity (the twin goals); (ii) identification of
main themes and further research based on knowledge gaps identified in the initial review; and (iii) organizing and prioritizing areas of focus
for achieving progress towards the twin goals.
A systematic review of potential opportunities and constraints that could affect the twin goals led to the identification of
main themes. This SCD is based on a systematic and detailed review of key potential factors impacting progress on the twin goals by using a
hybrid framework that combines the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva
(2014) assets-based framework. The systematic review of Sri Lanka’s performance on the 22 factors identified by this framework led to four
major themes, which formed the basis for organizing this report: (i) fiscal sustainability and the need to ensure fiscal space for development;
(ii) fostering growth and jobs for the bottom 40 percent; (iii) ensuring spatial and social inclusion; and (iv) the importance of more effective
and efficient governance.
Prioritization was then conducted in two steps. First, throughout the report, prioritization was based on technical factors, including
comparisons of Sri Lanka to other countries that are similar or aspirational as a means of prioritizing areas. Areas where Sri Lanka demonstrated
relatively strong performance for an LMIC, such as overall access to infrastructure and basic health outcomes were assessed as having less
importance as a constraint, but rather reflected opportunities for Sri Lanka to capitalize on in making progress on the twin goals. These
opportunities are summarized briefly at the beginning of Chapter IV. The first six chapters of this volume represent the result of analysis that
was made against the general criteria of:
•

The potential impact on ending poverty and on promoting shared prosperity: This assessed its potential impact on ending
poverty and ensuring a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off. The overall impact on achieving the twin goals will
obviously have the highest weighting.

•

Complementarities: This refers to the degree to which addressing these constraints would have influence across different domains
(growth, inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other constraints.

•

Strength of the evidence base behind the impact. This refers to the extent to which there is a compelling argument for particular
reforms, with the stronger cases scoring higher priority.

•

Time horizon of impacts: This refers to the timeframe under which the impact can be expected to be realized, and would seek to
balance short- and longer-term impacts.

•

Preconditions: These are constraints that need to be addressed to unlock wider potential.

The second step in the prioritization process involved consultations with a broad set of stakeholders after the completion of
a first working draft. These consultations validated the analysis and served to assess the relative importance of the diagnosed constraints
and drivers. Over 120 persons from various spheres participated in consultations. Discussions at the consultations were complemented by
surveys to ensure a broad range of inputs. On the basis of the consultations and completed analysis, prioritization of areas against the criteria
was finalized. A summary of this prioritization is below; for a fuller treatment, please see Annex 1.4.

nate export taxes (cesses) on agricultural commodities.
Continued focus on improving trade facilitation and the
logistics environment, including streamlining licenses
and permits required to export would help to promote
export-led growth. Similarly, greater linkages between
R&D institutions and networks of entrepreneurs can help
competitiveness and a more outward-oriented economy,
particularly for agriculture. Moreover, there is need to improve the regulatory environment to allow firms to grow,
reducing informality and allowing for economy-wide increases in productivity and allowing firms to reach economies of scale. Some aspects of the regulatory environment
that appear to be significant obstacles are: upgrading the
systems for land tenure and land-use planning in both

VII. Conclusions

agricultural and rural areas; modernizing labor legislation to encourage easier movement of labor and female
labor participation; ensuring that the burden to business
licensing and permits is minimal, particularly in regions
where this is a problem, such as the North; and providing
for speedier resolution of commercial disputes and enforcement of contracts in court or using alternative-dispute mechanisms. Bringing larger and more profitable
firms into the formal system and improving enforcement
could help formalization efforts. The definition of priorities
for investment climate reforms to unleash firms’ potential
should stem from regular dialogue between the public
and private sectors.

Rationale
Fiscal sustainability a key precondition for progress in all areas,
including macroeconomic stability. Greater fiscal space allows
for addressing equality of opportunity through increased social
spending, especially important for inclusion. Efficiency of social
protection has direct impact on ending poverty. Evidence base is
strong.
Trade and adoption of new technologies promote diversification,
external sustainability, and growth, which translates to good
jobs. Overcoming skills mismatches contributes to growth and
participation of the bottom 40 percent, including minorities and
women. Evidence base is strong for skills and trade policy issues.

Urbanizing areas are associated with growth and absolute majority
of poor are proximate to these areas. Ensuring continued benefits
of agglomeration will help progress for the majority of the poor.
For those living in more remote areas, more targeted interventions
will be needed to ensure equality of opportunity through improved
service delivery and greater participation in the labor force. Evidence
base is very strong.

Governance has cross-cutting impact on all other challenges. In
particular, labor, land, and other regulation create major distortions
in the economy. The size of the public sector leads to inefficient
use of public resources and distorts labor markets. The ability of
government to carry out core functions depends on effectiveness of
the public sector. Evidence base is strong.
Peace is sine qua non for continued investment, growth, and
personal well-being of large segment of the population. Sustaining
the state’s institutional capability over the long term is integral
competent facilitation of private-sector-led growth. Macro-economic
and environmental sustainability are preconditions for continued
progress as well as capitalizing on the country’s asset base. Evidence
of associated risks is strong.

307. The role and participation of the public sector
in the economy poses further competitiveness constraints. Stronger management and strategic oversight of
the SOE sector is important to ensure that state involvement is serving a public purpose, does not create too
much fiscal risk, and is not crowding out the private sector.
The state should take steps to ensure that the public service is “fit for purpose” to carry out public-sector functions
and not as a mechanism for job creation. The state can play
a role that facilitates greater private-sector involvement
through the establishment of a robust institutional framework for public-private partnerships that would ensure
public interests and investor concerns are balanced while
crowding in private-sector investment and skills. Finally,
measures to address conflict of interest could reduce negative impacts of the interconnectedness of government
with specific businesses. These measures together will
help provide an environment conducive to efficiency- and
productivity-enhancing FDI, allowing for less emphasis on
targeted incentives.
308. The inclusion challenge is two-fold, recognizing
that absolute numbers of the poor and bottom 40 percent are in urbanizing population centers while relative concentrations of poverty are in specific, relatively
remote districts. Forty-three percent of the poor are in
the districts directly along the Kandy-Colombo-Galle corridor, which has seen significant agglomeration and associated growth over the past two decades. The challenge will
be to ensure that the poor and bottom 40 percent are able
to participate in this growth going forward as a means to
lift themselves out of poverty. Priority efforts in this respect include proper urban management in addition to
adequate access to services to ensure the poor living in
these areas of agglomeration can benefit from economic
activity in these areas. At the same time, there are “pockets” of high rates of poverty in the North, East, estate sector
and Moneragala where equality of opportunity in terms
of access to services and linkages to the labor market are
lower. Efforts to ensure inclusion of these communities
could include small works programs aimed at improving
market accessibility, incentives to promote entrepreneurship among educated youth and direct programs to help
ex-combatants and female-headed households. In the estates, multi-sector interventions to improve nutrition outcomes, enhance job opportunities for the youth, and prepare for a growing number of aging workers would help
in ensuring their inclusion in shared growth. In addition,
there is need to address land claims in the former conflict
areas, providing assistance to new and “old” IDPs. The lack
of increase in female participation in the labor force despite decades of high educational attainment, caused in
part by labor practices, is a major cross-cutting issue. Efforts to address this could entail both reforms to the legal

VII. Conclusions

and regulatory environment, as well reforms of the public
sector to ensure that the private sector can compete, more
targeted interventions that could ensure women are able
and willing to pursue careers that are in line with the demands in the labor market, and fostering greater participation of women in leadership positions.

Cross-Cutting Challenges
309. The governance challenge manifests itself in
many ways, which taken together constitute the fundamental constraint on progress on the twin goals.
Governance issues are cross cutting and underlie in many
important ways the three challenges outlined above. Governance is obviously central to the quality and probity of
public expenditure as well as to the government’s capacity to provide for equality of opportunity for the poor and
bottom 40 percent to improve their welfare. Moreover, the
quality of governance is integral to addressing corruption
concerns and sustaining public trust. It is also integral to
revenue performance, particularly the effectiveness of tax
and customs administration. The most prominent manner
in which governance acts as a constraint is in how the state
carries out regulatory functions for the economy. Policies
that orient the economy inward, such as the convoluted
tax system, restrictive land and labor market regulation,
and inefficient subsidies -- and the related quality of administration thereof -- reflect areas where governance is a
critical constraint. This burden of government regulation
has led to a large informal sector, which negatively impacts
improvements in productivity. Governance weaknesses
have further led to significant expansion of the public sector’s role in the labor market and certain economic sectors.
This expanded role in the economy contributes little to effective use of the country’s resources or productivity gains,
whether it is interventions in agriculture, multiplying tax
incentives, or absorbing a significant portion of the labor
force. Finally, ensuring the provision of key public goods,
such as infrastructure and public services, is a core function of government; the extent to which there is inequality
in access to such goods reflects areas where strengthened
governance is warranted. The transparency and accountability reform agenda of the present leadership is an important opportunity to strengthen governance, though
this will be a long-term process.
310. Sustainability risks should be borne in mind
while addressing constraints to progress on the twin
goals. The longer-term risks of security and institutional
reform, as well as economic and environmental sustainability, will require adequate planning and mitigating policies sooner rather than later. Above all, the sine qua non for
progress on all fronts is a sustained focus on overcoming
grievances that have fed past conflict and, more generally,

carrying through on good governance reforms is integral
to providing stability. This will likely include sustained implementation of mechanisms to address these issues, including domestic mechanisms for assessing accountability
as well as following through on the many LLRC recommendations. It also calls for consistent consideration of promoting inclusion and reconciliation across all public programs.
External sustainability is integral to macroeconomic stability, and will require structural reforms that allow for increases in FDI and long-term private-sector flows instead
of external borrowing. Long-term fiscal sustainability given the aging population will require planning in order to
meet declining revenues and increasing expenditures due
to this demographic change. Long-term improvement in
revenue and increasing the retirement age in line with
increasing life expectancy would help to avoid major adjustment in the future. Finally, Sri Lanka will be well served
in seeking to ensure environmentally sustainable growth
and better manage disaster risk. This could include soil
conservation efforts, protection of watersheds, improved
solid waste management, and holistic, long-term planning
to promote green growth. In addition, a national disaster
risk financing strategy will be needed, along with better integration of disaster relief with improved social protection
distribution programs.
311. These challenges are in many cases areas of opportunity for the next five years. The constraints identified in this diagnostic are issues that can realistically begin to be addressed in the coming years through policy
changes and improvements in capacity. Raising revenues
is much easier than cutting expenditures, and there is significant global experience to draw upon. Trade liberalization is possible, as Sri Lanka itself demonstrated in the late
1970s and 1990s, though this will need to be accompanied
by regulatory reforms in land and labor markets to ensure
that the private sector can truly be competitive. Sri Lanka
has advantages that should make it attractive for FDI; the
administrative steps to become more attractive have been
demonstrated by many of its MIC competitors in Southeast
Asia. More granular understanding of the specific needs of
the poor and how they can participate in labor markets
should allow for more efficient use of resources in providing of infrastructure and services that lead to equality of
opportunity. There is much that Sri Lanka can realistically
accomplish that will allow for it to capitalize more fully on
its location, natural endowments, and human capital.

significant indirect effects for the country as a whole and
the bottom 40 percent in particular. At a basic level, greater fiscal space and efficiency of expenditure will allow government to be more effective. A growing economy can be
expected to provide jobs for the bottom 40 percent and an
environment conducive to addressing specific inclusion
challenges, which, in turn, provides for sustainability.
313. There are particularly important areas of synergy that provide for progress on inclusion, sustainability and growth. For instance, effective governance of cities will not only be critical for addressing spatial inclusion
challenges, but could also improve the benefits of urban
agglomeration and raise the level of overall growth and
job creation. Good governance in urbanizing areas is also
important to balance social, environmental, and economic
equity concerns to allow for Sri Lanka to benefit long term
from its relatively unharmed natural asset base. Improving
partnership between the public and private sectors will
facilitate more private-sector-led growth and can crowd
in financing of public goods to lessen the fiscal burden
on the state. Similarly, improving equality of opportunity
(including addressing land claims) across ethnic groups
is likely to be crucial for improving social stability and the
sustainability of peace. Moreover, closing the gender gap
in labor force participation is not only important in terms
of social inclusion, but is, in effect, critical in terms of the
broader challenge of raising competitiveness and ensuring shared prosperity, particularly given an aging population will increase the dependency rate.

Synergies

314. There is a nexus of issues around providing for
skills development that meets the needs of Sri Lanka’s
economy going forward. On the one hand, there are
important elements of state performance that need addressing to improve the population’s skills mix: its ability
to create more fiscal space to provide quality education
to the population; the efficiency of resources directed towards human capital development; its ability to listen to
and partner with the private sector on ensuring that the
right skills are being provided, both by public and private
institutions; and the impact that the state has on the labor market given its outsized role as an employer. At the
same time, investment in skills, particularly with public financing, is integral to equipping the bottom 40 percent
with capacity to get good jobs, a fundamental means of
boosting shared prosperity. A more skilled labor force in
turn helps Sri Lanka become more competitive, including
within global value chains, as well as a more attractive as a
destination for FDI.

312. The areas of priority identified above are highly interrelated. Because the constraints go to the core of
how Sri Lanka’s government and economy function, progress in reducing these constraints can be expected to have

Note : The MDG Country Progress Snapshot provides an overview of the progress achieved at country level since 1990 towards the Millennium Development Goals. The snapshot is
intended mainly to provide the international community easy access to the information and are not meant to replace in any way the country profiles produced at the national level in
several countries. They are also meant to reflect the contribution of country-level progress to the global and regional trends on progress towards the MDGs.
The data used in the snapshot are from the MDG global database (http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx). The metadata and responsible agencies can be found on http://mdgs.
un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx. Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures are due to, among others, different methodology and definitions or different choice of
data sources. At the global level, the monitoring of the progress aims to ensure better comparability of data among countries.

APPENDIX 1.2
POVERTY INDICATORS FOR SRI LANKA
How is Poverty measured?
The official poverty figures in Sri Lanka refer to the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls below the official poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and it is a measure of the incidence
of poverty. The data used for the analysis are drawn from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), which has
been collected every three to five years since 1995. The 2012/13 HIES covers all 25 districts for the first time in the history of
the Sri Lanka household budget survey.
The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and nonfood items of each household. The consumption aggregate is spatially deflated to take into account differences in the cost of living of the different
districts. To get the per capita consumption, the spatially deflated consumption aggregate is divided by the number of
household members (excluding the persons who are member of the household but usually live elsewhere in the country or
abroad). Once per capita household consumption is calculated, it is then compared to the national poverty line, which was
set to Rs 1,423 in 2002, equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 2,030 kilocalories per capita per day (using the
Cost of Basic Needs approach). The poverty line has been subsequently updated using the Colombo Consumer Price Index.
The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 ppp terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines
found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88 surveyed countries over the period 19902005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). The Sri Lanka national poverty line is about $1.50 a day in 2005 ppp. Other
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2.50 a day and $4 a day
in 2005 ppp, which correspond to, in turn, Rs 6,058 and Rs 9,692 a day in 2012/13 prices. In addition to the national poverty
line, The SCD will use the US $1.25, US $2.50 poverty lines.

The poverty gap and severity of poverty
Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming in that it does not
take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that overcomes this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the
poverty line as a share measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself. The severity of poverty is a measure that puts a
higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line. Both of these measures will complement the analysis of
headcount poverty in the context of the SCD.

What is the consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent?
Finally, the SCD will focus on the bottom 40 percent to discuss the welfare of the less well-off more broadly. The consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent (the threshold below which the poorest 40 percent of population lays) in
2012/13 is Rs 6,765, or $ 2.79 a day in 2005 ppp.

Key issues with consumption calculations in Sri Lanka
There are three main concerns about the methodology followed for building the official consumption aggregate. First, the
consumption aggregate includes some items that are usually excluded, in particular: expenditure on durable goods, rarely incurred expenses (e.g. weddings, funerals, ceremonies, litigations, purchased properties), and expenses on provident
funds, insurances, payment of debts, money lending and income taxes are typically excluded (see Deaton and Zaidi, 2002).
Second, to guarantee comparability across surveys, the consumption aggregate should exclude items that were not included in previous years’ questionnaires, or those for which the recall period has changed over time. Third, since the survey is
conducted over a period of 12 months, the use of a temporal price adjustment would be recommended.

APPENDIX 1.4
METHODOLOGY
This Systematic Country Diagnostic was compiled in three phases: (i) a comprehensive gathering and review of
existing evidence of constraints and factors towards progress on ending extreme poverty and promoting shared
prosperity (the twin goals); (ii) identification of main themes and further research based on knowledge gaps identified in the initial review; and (iii) organizing and prioritizing areas of focus for achieving progress towards the twin
goals. A guiding principle was to have broad participation and feedback from the World Bank Group’s Sri Lanka country
team as well as external experts and stakeholders to ensure completeness of data collection and analysis. Thus, following
an initial desk review of evidence, a series of brainstorming sessions were held with a broad team of stakeholders. Ultimately an additional 14 background papers and notes were also either commissioned independently or completed in parallel
and utilized for the SCD.

Marshalling evidence
A hybrid framework combining the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with
the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) assets-based framework was used to identify a set of possible constraints and
drivers towards progress on the twin goals. The Hausman, Rodrick and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostic is a top-down
approach based on a simplified growth model that identifies for several potential distortions.165 In order to focus on the
ability of the bottom 40 percent to latch on to the growth process, this top-down approach was combined with the princi-

165 Following Dixit (2007) we do not use the framework as a decision tree, but rather as a way to organize and discipline the analysis by identifying the
range of possible constraints and drivers.

ples of the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva assets framework. The Bussolo/Lopez-Calva framework postulates that the incomes of
the bottom 40 percent depend on the level of assets – human, physical, financial, social and natural capital – that people
own and accumulate, the intensity with which they are used, and the returns associated to those assets. The method aims
to consider the constraints as well as facilitating factors to asset accumulation and their use. These have a direct impact
on the income generation capacity of all households in an economy, but particularly on the poor and those belonging to
the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. The framework in Figure A1 thus places shared prosperity as the desired
goal, which in turn depends on economic growth and the ability of the bottom 40 percent to benefit from growth. The
framework provides a breakdown of the range of possible factors contributing or constraining achievement of this outcome.
The returns to economic activity depend on the availability of assets and the returns to those assets. Assets include
human, social, natural and physical capital, with a focus on the bottom 40 percent. Human capital includes health, education and nutrition (Figure A1). While “social capital” refers to a specific concept and attendant literature, in fact issues of
social inclusion are central to acquiring and using assets. Social inclusion is defined as “improving the terms of individuals
and groups, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society”.166 This can be achieved by improving the
ability, opportunity, and dignity of such people, who are disadvantaged, inter alia, on the basis of their gender, age, disability status, caste, ethnicity, marital status or sexual orientation. Natural capital refers to access to land, a clean environment,
and natural resources such as forests and fisheries. Physical capital refers to access to basic infrastructure, including roads,
ports, electricity, water, and sanitation. It is also important to note that that there is a strong non-monetary dimension to
“shared prosperity”. That is, the growth impact of health, education, social inclusion and natural capital may not be very

large, but their impact on “well-being” may be huge.167 Health, education, social inclusion and the environment matter for
their intrinsic value, not just for their instrumental value to boost growth.
The returns to economic activity also depend on the returns to those assets, which in turn depend on government
performance and performance of the market. Government performance is reflected in its ability to (i) maintain macroeconomic stability; (ii) ensure the effective provision of public goods and services; (iii) provide a regulatory environment
that provides a level playing field that facilitates economic activity; and (iv) mitigate individual risks through a social protection system and addressing systemic risks. Market performance depends on whether there are barriers to competition
in domestic markets as well as export competitiveness of the economy as a whole, the ability to innovate, and whether
there are distortions in markets that constrain growth of the bottom 40 percent. Special attention was paid to the labor and
agricultural markets given their effects on the bottom 40 percent. Each of these potential constraints or areas of strength
was considered, evaluating the relative strength of each as a threat to future efforts to end poverty and ensure shared
prosperity.
Access to finance depends on the availability of domestic savings and access to international finance. It also depends on
whether there are bottlenecks in local finance with respect to high cost of finance, high risk (or poor risk management),
insufficient competition, issues with banking intermediation, or lack of financial literacy.
The framework provides a means to “leave no stone unturned” while also unbundling interrelated issues, which in
turn allows for greater specificity as well as comprehensiveness. Many of the possible constraints or drivers are interrelated or cross cutting. This is particularly the case with government performance. For instance, the government’s ability
to finance (or attract private-sector financing) and organize the delivery of public goods and services has a direct impact
on the quality and quantity of assets held by the poor, and its performance as a regulator affects markets and the cost of
finance. For the purposes of this SCD, performance of government was reviewed in terms of core government functionality
and capacity whereas its specific impacts in areas such as improving human capital were addressed in those respective
sections. Similarly, social inclusion concerns are cross cutting. They are, however, distinct in their core interest in individuals
and groups disadvantaged on the basis of their distinguishing features and how their ability, opportunity and dignity to
own, accumulate and use assets and generate returns from them can be improved.

Identification of main themes and prioritization
Prioritization was conducted in two steps. First, analysis of technical issues and outputs/outcomes among possible
constraints or, conversely, strong performance along each of the 22 dimensions identified in the framework pointed to
the relative importance of a given issue. Where possible, this analysis was complemented by comparisons of Sri Lanka to
its past performance as well as to other countries that have similarities and/or are aspirational for the country, primarily
in South and Southeast Asia. While differences in Sri Lanka’s performance compared to others did not necessarily mean
the presence of a constraint, in cases where the country was an outlier often did indicate areas of relative weakness. This
process led to the identification of four main themes in the context of wide consultation, both within the Bank as well as
through brainstorming sessions with multiple stakeholders in Sri Lanka.
The information and analysis gathered were then weighed against five criteria:
■■

The potential impact on ending poverty and on promoting shared prosperity: This assessed its potential impact on
ending poverty and ensuring a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off. The overall impact on achieving
the twin goals will obviously have the highest weighting.

■■

Complementarities: This refers to the degree to which addressing these constraints would have influence across different domains (growth, inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other constraints.

■■

Strength of the evidence base behind the impact. This refers to the extent to which there is a compelling argument for
particular reforms, with the stronger cases scoring higher priority.

■■

Time horizon of impacts: This refers to the timeframe under which the impact can be expected to be realized, and

167

144

Becker, 1964, 2007

would seek to balance short and longer-term impacts.
■■

Preconditions: This would identify constraints that need to be addressed in order to unlock wider potential.

The second step in the prioritization process involved consultations with a broad set of stakeholders after the completion of a first working draft. The team carried out several rounds of consultations among focal points representing
global practices, cross-cutting solutions areas, and IFC operations regarding the draft of the analysis and solicited input on
priorities, based on the above criteria. External consultations on the analysis in the text and to identify priorities were held
with a broad range of stakeholders in government ministries and departments, think tanks, other civil society groups, representatives of the private sector, and development partners. Consultations were held in Colombo and in Jaffna to capture
a broader range of views. The consultations both helped to validate the analysis in the SCD and to help assess the relative
importance of the diagnosed constraints and drivers.
On the basis of feedback from all consultations, the team substantiated priorities against the five criteria. The finalization of priorities against criteria is articulated in the tables below.

in isolated regions. In the estates,
improving nutrition outcomes,
better job opportunities for the
youth, and preparing for an aging
population will ensure inclusion.

IMPACT ON TWIN
GOALS

As a country with a
history of violent conflict,
long-term reconciliation
among the country’s
ethnic communities, and
preventing new fissures
along religious lines from
emerging, are essentially
for creating a climate of
inclusivity and promoting
shared prosperity.

Governance reforms that
improve accountability
to citizen’s can improve
efficacy of state programs
in meeting the twin
goals. Recent governance
reforms must be seen
as a beginning in a
wider effort to improve
effectiveness and
accountability of the
state.

Reliance on debt to finance
growth constrains the
available public finances
to meet social needs and
tackle extreme poverty as
more money is utilized on
debt repayment. Attracting
FDI will contribute to growth
of the private sector and
create jobs for the bottom
40 percent.

Tackling environmental
challenges will reduce
vulnerability of communities
at most risk of droughts,
sea level rise, crop loss and
agricultural land degradation,
water pollution, landslides
due to deforestation, etc.
Environmental management
will also influence poverty in
urban areas.

Without a robust and wellfinanced pension scheme,
Sri Lanka would leave older
populations in poorer groups

Sri Lanka has taken significant strides in recent years to upgrade the amount and accessibility of infrastructure.
Whereas South Asian comparators continue to have infrastructure gaps that profoundly limit access for large segments of
the population, Sri Lanka has a solid infrastructure base (Figures A3 and A4). Going forward, the main issues for Sri Lanka’s
infrastructure development lie primarily in terms of efficiency of operations and maintenance and the lack of an effective
framework for soliciting private investment or more generally setting up public-private partnerships. Infrastructure has
largely been financed by the budget, with the exception of some independent power generation plants and telecommunications networks. Access issues according to 2012/13 HIES data are concentrated in conflict-affected areas in the North,
though there has been visible improvement in that region. The government has invested over 220 billion rupees, or about
4.4 percent of its total expenditures (outside of interest payments) in infrastructure in the Northern Province alone over the
past five years (Ministry of Finance 2014).
Nearly all households have regular access to electricity and power supply is expected to keep pace with an annual
increase in demand of close to 10 percent, though this increase will need to be balanced to minimize environmental
impacts. Thanks in part to increased private-sector participation, there have been strong gains in recent years in reliability
and accessibility of electricity (Figure A5). Recently added capacity has yielded a 94 percent electrification rate according
to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). HIES data for 2012/13 shows 96.6 percent of the population in general (94.2 percent
for the bottom 40 percent) had access to electricity, with post-conflict areas of Mullaitivu (58.3 percent) and Kilinochchi
(40.3 percent). as the major outliers (Figure 29). Of greater issue is the cost of electricity, which appears to be driving the
identification of power as a constraint as per the last enterprise survey in 2011, though recent tariff reductions of 25 percent
have eased this burden. Costs are driven mostly by fuel imports for thermal generation. System losses have gone down
from over 20 percent in 2000 to roughly 12 percent in 2011 (World Bank 2013). Notwithstanding this record, there is scope
for improving efficiency in the power sector through optimizing dispatch from generation plants into the grid. Thanks to
tariff reforms and a write-down of liabilities, the state-run CEB turned a net profit in 2013. Future demand for energy is
expected to be met almost entirely from coal-fired plants with a reduction in the use of fuel oil and hydropower staying
level at around 4000 GWh per year and renewable sources modestly increasing from their current levels (Figure 30). How-

150

ever, there is substantial potential and political
willingness to develop the renewable energy
sector through significant public and private
investments with the aim to source a large
share of the country’s future energy demand
from renewable sources, focusing on wind, hydro and pumps-storage.

in modal share of private vehicles from 2010 to
2030 coupled with limitations on available road
space as well as poor condition of public transport. Sri Lanka has built expressways connecting the Southern and Western
Provinces and has plans to build an expressway network connecting the rest of the island. Capital expenditure on roads has
been financed through foreign borrowing (over half of which is from the Chinese Government) and government resources;
private financing is expected to be sought for construction of the Northern Expressway. The major issues facing the roads
sector are deferring maintenance in a tight budget environment, contracting issues, and attracting private-sector financing. A 2013 report found in a sample of road rehabilitation contracts variations resulting in cost elevation from 38 percent
to 53 percent and contract time extensions from the initial period up to completion from 7.5 percent to 180 percent (World
Bank 2013). In addition, there are multiple cases of contracting without competitive selection, often owing to financing
conditions from external lenders.

mobile telephony market has five major companies of which two are dominant. Competition has led to some of the lowest
data and voice rates in the world. However, the dynamics in Sri Lanka’s market are such that there is limited incentive for
players to invest in increased broadband services in rural areas and new services, which in turn may delay the introduction
of new, innovative services in the sector. Despite concerns regarding broadband quality and cost, IT-enabled services and
the software industry have grown rapidly in recent years, now accounting for $500 million in export receipts and around
70,000 employed. Despite this success, there remains a workforce deficit in the ICT industry.

While sector liberalization has supported
the expansion of mobile services across
the country, there are areas where ICT policy and regulation could be strengthened.
These areas include enforcing stronger compliance to high-quality standards for voice
services and data speeds, encouraging faster
broadband roll out in rural areas, and regulating equal and open access to essential facilities
such as submarine landing stations and backbone networks. Sri Lanka is also one of the few
countries in the region that has not leveraged
telecommunications infrastructure rollout by
other utility providers such as the power transmission, railways and roads authorities. An infrastructure sharing policy would help expand
broadband services across the country, lower
costs of service provision and provide for domestic network redundancies.

Sri Lanka overall outperforms its South
Source:World Telecommunication/ICT Development Report, 2014
Asian comparators in providing for water
and sanitation, but there is substantial differences within the country between urban, rural, and estate sectors. As shown in Figure 26, Sri Lanka has slightly
better indicators than South Asian peers and is comparable to LMICs in East Asia. Pipe borne water supply coverage stands
at 44 percent (2013, National Water Supply Drainage Board (NWSDB)) nationally; of which 34 percent is managed by the
NWSDB and the rest are mainly community managed Rural Water Supply (RWS) schemes or schemes managed by the local
authorities. The technical capacity for the operation and maintenance of an estimated 40 percent of the over 4,000 RWS
schemes in the country remains low, prompting the government to establish a new National Community Water Supply Department in the past year. Approximately 75 percent of the urban population has access to pipe borne water while around
20 percent of the rural population has such access. The quality of service is also lower for communities in small towns and
rural areas, where continuous 24-hour supply is a rarity. The water and sanitation service levels in the plantations (estate
sector) remain far below the national average, with only sporadic investments having been made in these areas over the
past few decades. Yet overall access to safe drinking water, which includes protected wells, is high and reported to be 85
percent of the total population (NWSDB 2013) and 94 percent according to WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme
(JMP) figures of 2012 for water and sanitation released in 2014. Similarly, the NWSDB estimates that 85.7 percent of the
population has access to adequate sanitation; with 83.2 percent having onsite sanitation and 2.5 percent a piped system.
The 2012/13 HIES data point to lower levels of access to water (62.2 percent of all households and 55.2 percent of the bottom 40 percent) and sanitation (47 percent of the overall population and 36.2 percent of the bottom 40 percent having a
toilet on premises), with much lower levels of access in the Northern districts of Kilinochchi, Mulaitivuu, and Vavuniya. The
discrepancy is due in large part to the HIES not accounting for protected wells and RWS as access to water.

APPENDIX 2.2
OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES IN ACCESS TO FINANCE
Opportunities

Obstacles

Commercial banks
have limited
ability and to serve
MSMEs.

■■ Financial innovation among commercial banks (which dominate the financial sector in Sri Lanka) has been
limited, with lending practices based on collateral and limited interest in development of other credit processes
such as cash-flow-based lending and financial instruments beyond loans. Anecdotal evidence suggests that lack
of competition (in spite of a large number of banks in the sector) has reduced incentives for innovation to target
underserved economic segments.
■■ Despite the high penetration of regulated financial institutions in Sri Lanka, an estimated 64 percent of micro,
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) remain without checking or savings accounts (World Bank, 2014e),
highlighting the need for both higher bank penetration, as well as opportunities for complementary non-bank
financial institutions to target underserved market segments.

Credit infrastructure
deficiencies limit
the ability of
lenders to identify
creditworthy
borrowers.

■■ Credit bureau covers 44.5 percent of the population, and 30 percent of registered firms1. However important
sources of information on creditworthiness, such as payment history with microfinance institutions and utilities,
are not included in the information.
■■ Movable collateral registries do not exist in Sri Lanka. This severely curtails the ability of firms and entrepreneurs
to use non-real estate assets (eg. vehicles, machinery, inventory, accounts receivable) as security to their loans.
This, together with the bank practices based on collateralization lead to major de-facto obstacles to borrowers,
especially smaller ones, which account for 93 percent2 of the enterprise sector.

Legal framework
deficiencies
enhance lenders’
risk aversion,
increase cost of
credit and reduce
availability of
finance.

■■ Banks experience significant difficulties in case of borrowers’ default. Despite the existence of a separate
Commercial Court, resolution of legal disputes takes on average 44 months, creates costs of more than 20
percent of the disputed value and requires more than 40 individual steps. Moreover, anecdotal evidence
suggests significant discretion in the application of laws resulting in unpredictability of judiciary processes.
These deficiencies enhance banks’ risk aversion, which limits incentives to expand the borrower base, and
fosters increasing collateralization requirements. The high cost of disputes resolution is passed on to borrowers
as a higher cost of credit.
■■ The existing Secured Transactions law in the country does not support the operationalization of the collateral
registry in an enforceable manner.

Limited
development
of financial
instruments
beyond traditional
bank loans leaves
important sectors
and financial
services needs
underserved.

■■ Factoring can enhance the ability of MSMEs to obtain financing for working capital by leveraging their otherwise
idle accounts receivable. However, shortcomings in secured transactions framework hamper the viability of
factoring as a financial product.
■■ Operational leasing of equipment (an alternative to longer-term bank loans) has been hampered by deficiencies
in secured transactions (see above) and the lack of a well-functioning movable collateral registry.
■■ Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) can be an important source of financing for micro entrepreneurs, especially in
rural areas. However, the lack of regulation and supervision of the MFI sector has led to a proliferation of lenders
(estimated at more than 1,000) with anecdotal evidence of abuses on pricing and loan recovery practices. The
lack of regulation of deposit-taking MFIs also creates significant risks for savers.
■■ Insurance is significantly underdeveloped for an economy with the income and aspirations of Sri Lanka, leaving
enterprises and individuals vulnerable to unforeseen events. Less than less than 15 percent of SMEs and less
than 1 percent of micro enterprises used any form of insurance. Personal insurance premiums account for 1.22
percent of GDP, well below the proportion in India, Malaysia and Thailand (4.10 percent, 4.92 percent and 4.07
percent, respectively).

Lack of consumer
protection,
financial literacy,
and business
development
services expose
the population to
significant risks.

■■ Lack of a well-defined consumer protection framework (including appointment and empowerment of an agency
in charge of its enforcement) leave users of financial services unprotected against unfair practices by lenders.
■■ Lack of financial literacy initiatives and business development services, especially targeting micro entrepreneurs
and low-income individuals in urban and rural areas enhance the risk of over-indebtedness.

Lack of financial
innovation around
remittances
restricts their
potential
mobilization for
investment.

■■ Remittances represented about 10 percent of GDP and 86 percent of reserves in 20143. But Sri Lanka has not
leveraged fully the potential of remittances due to factors including:
-- High cost of formal channels with an average fee for remittances of more than 10 percent of the principal.
This discourages the use of formal channels in favor of informal mechanisms, thereby limiting the flow and
permanency within the financial sector.
-- Use of innovative cross-border money-transfer technologies through mobile phone platforms has not
been developed in Sri Lanka, while it has proved a way to enhance accessibility and affordability of formal
remittance channels in other countries in the region
-- Financial Innovation leveraging remittances flows has not taken place in Sri Lanka, while in other countries
this has led to investment instruments linked to remittances including housing and larger investments
(diaspora bonds).
