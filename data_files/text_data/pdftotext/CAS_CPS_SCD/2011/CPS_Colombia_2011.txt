EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Colombia is an upper-middle income country with the fourth largest economy in Latin
America. President Juan Manuel Santos assumed office in August 2010 with a strong
political mandate that gave his ―national unity‖ coalition an 80 percent majority in Congress.
The elections demonstrated the maturity of Colombia‘s democratic process and reflected a
strengthening of political institutions. The new President is committed to continue
implementing the core policy framework established by the previous government, while also
promoting new reforms to boost growth and tackle poverty and inequality.
Colombia has a solid and stable economy with a large domestic market and a rich
natural resources endowment. A strong macroeconomic framework helped cushion the
impact of the economic crisis. By 2010, the Colombian economy had fully recovered from
the 2008-09 slowdown; GDP growth reached 4.3 percent in 2010, compared to 1.5 percent in
2009. Private domestic demand, supported by higher consumer and investor confidence and
access to cheap credit, has led the recovery process. On the supply side, the recovery was
spearheaded by the mining and financial sectors.
In December 2010, the Government launched its ambitious National Development Plan,
called Prosperity for All. The overarching goals of this Plan are to increase employment,
reduce poverty, and improve security. The Plan has three strategic areas: (1) Sustainable
Growth and Competitiveness, (2) Equality of Opportunities for Social Prosperity, and (3)
Consolidation of Peace. Moreover, it highlights four cross-cutting themes: (a) Relevance of
International Relations, (b) Environmental and Disaster Risk Management, (c) Good
Governance, and (d) Regional Development and Integration.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds on the successful experience of the
prior World Bank Group (WBG) strategy in Colombia. It aims to support the new
National Development Plan. The WBG will step up efforts to enhance development impact
through selectivity and to provide added value to the country. The IFC hopes to increase both
its investment and advisory operations in Colombia, as market conditions permit. The WBG
will carry out activities either through financial, knowledge, or convening services for which
the Government or the private sector has expressed explicit need. These activities are
combined as a results-focused package of support grouped under three strategic themes: (a)
Expanding Opportunities for Social Prosperity; (b) Sustainable Growth with Enhanced
Climate Change Resilience; and (c) Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity.
Despite the slow decline of poverty and inequality over the last decade, Colombia has
continued to strengthen its social policies to expand opportunities to the majority of the
population. Colombia‘s efforts to achieve lasting peace are also commendable. Still, the
country‘s recent history has been marred by violence and armed conflicts that have precluded
it from reaching its full development potential. Violence has displaced a large portion of the
population, and the new Government has adopted policies to further promote peace.
While in recent years progress has been achieved in fostering infrastructure
investments, Colombia lags behind other Latin American countries. Management of
infrastructure assets, including maintenance, and improved information systems remains a
critical challenge within the context of Colombia‘s three-tier system of decentralized public

administration. While urbanization rates have remained high, the quality of urban services
has not kept up with the growth of cities. Environmental management and climate change are
increasingly important areas of policy action in Colombia. Despite Colombia‘s major
improvements in environmental management, environmental degradation affects public
health and welfare in significant ways and compromises the country‘s potential for
sustainable economic growth.
Colombia also needs to focus on achieving faster and more inclusive economic growth.
The country requires policy efforts geared toward converting the country‘s natural and
human resources into a development pattern that accelerates growth and shares its benefits
with broad segments of the population. In particular, it requires skillful management of risks
and fiscal policy challenges associated with natural resources wealth and careful monitoring
and evaluation of policies and programs conducive to inclusive growth. Transparent and
effective public sector institutions (at national and subnational levels) and a friendly business
environment will also facilitate this growth. And in support of innovation and
entrepreneurship for higher productivity, the development in the financial sector must deliver
efficient and stable services with access for all people.
The programs under these strategic themes reflect current dialogue with the authorities
and include the ongoing portfolio as well as new activities running until FY13. Within
the framework of the National Development Plan, new activities beyond FY13 will be
identified in agreement with the Government to acknowledge the needed flexibility and
responsiveness to emerging requests. The CPS Progress Report, which is envisaged after the
next Presidential elections in 2014, will provide an update on the WBG engagement.
The IFC will seek investments in areas where it can add the greatest value. The IFC‘s
main objectives are to foster greater entrepreneurship in advanced fields or in developing
innovative business models. Investments will be focused initially on education, infrastructure
development, investment climate, royalty management, and corporate governance. Also, IFC
may engage with selected agribusiness clients to enhance yields and productivity.

REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (FY12-16)
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Colombia is an upper middle-income country with substantial potential yet with
relatively high rates of poverty and inequality. It has a solid and stable economy with a
large domestic market and a rich natural resources endowment. At the same time Colombia is
particularly vulnerable to natural hazards and faces an important challenge in consolidating
peace following decades of internal strife and violence.
2.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the fiscal years 2012-16. It
proposes a World Bank Group (WBG) integrated program of financial, knowledge, and
convening services and has been designed to selectively support the Government of
Colombia‘s (GOC) new National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014. The proposed CPS is
also grounded in the LAC Regional Strategy and the WBG strategic themes. Its five-year
span takes into account the GOC election cycle in order to provide a mid-term opportunity to
address potential government and policy changes that will be reflected in the CPS Progress
Report. The CPS core principles are flexibility, responsiveness, and innovation. Past
experience has shown that WBG support to GOC is most effective by being adaptive and
receptive to emerging needs rather than just a blueprint of the terms and scope of the
partnership with GOC. The focus on innovation corresponds with the needs of a
sophisticated middle-income country and the WBG‘s efforts to add value to the GOC
program. The CPS lays out the guiding principles for shaping this partnership.
3.
This CPS provides a summary of (a) the country context, (b) the Government‘s
vision and development challenges, (c) lessons learned from the implementation of the
previous CPS as well as stakeholder feedback, (d) a proposed new strategy for the WBG, and
(e) a description of risks in Colombia.

II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political Context
4.
President Juan Manuel Santos assumed office in August 2010 with a strong
political mandate that gave his “national unity” coalition an 80 percent majority in
Congress. He won the second round of the Presidential poll by more than 70 percent of the
vote against a former mayor of Bogotá. Santos campaigned on a continuation of former
President Alvaro Uribe‘s democratic security and economic policies. The elections
demonstrated the maturity of Colombia‘s democratic process and reflected a strengthening of
political institutions. The country has undergone a transformation since 2002, striving to
move away from internal violence, drug trafficking, and weak institutions that has plagued
the country for many years. Today, Colombia has a resurgent economy with promising
prospects. It is a safer, more stable country that is more popular with foreign investors, and it
aspires to join the OECD group of countries.
1

5.
The Santos Administration registered several significant achievements early in
its first term. This includes the restoration of diplomatic and trade relationships with
Venezuela, which had been broken off shortly before the second round of the presidential
elections in July 2010. Relationships were also fully normalized with Ecuador. Moreover, an
agreement reached with the United States increases the likelihood that the bilateral Free
Trade Agreement, which was signed in 2006, will eventually be implemented. Overall, these
positive developments have helped boost the popularity ratings of the President and
strengthened the national unity coalition.
6.
The Santos Administration has launched a very ambitious reform program. To
consolidate the fiscal stance and manage windfalls from commodities production, Congress
has approved a new fiscal rule, a reform of the royalties system, and a proposal to make
fiscal sustainability a Constitutional criterion. Tax exemptions have been reduced, loopholes
closed, and import tariffs lowered in an effort to enhance revenues and promote
competitiveness. Legislation has been passed to reduce informality and encourage youth
employment. A new legal framework is being introduced to improve the performance of the
health system, including the enactment of an ordinary Health Law in 2011. And, a Victims
Law (Ley de Victimas) will compensate victims who have been harmed by actions as a result
of conflict.
7.
Municipal and regional elections are scheduled for October 2011, and the next
legislative and presidential elections are set for March and May 2014, respectively. The
outcome of the municipal and regional elections will help to gauge the support for the
various coalition members as well as the opposition during 2011–2015.
B. Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
8.
Colombia is an upper-middle income country whose economic performance is
typical of the major economies in Latin America. The economy is well endowed with
natural resources, including oil, coal, gas, iron, and gold. The domestic market is sizeable,
making it important for aggregate demand growth. Agribusiness (particularly coffee) and
manufacturing (e.g., the car industry) are also relatively well developed. Improved security
combined with business-friendly investment rules has led to a surge in foreign direct
investment, particularly in the oil and mining sector.
9.
Following a longer period of broad-based economic growth, the economy was
not affected too severely by the global economic crisis. Between 2002 and 2007, GDP
growth averaged 5.0 percent per year on account of an improving security situation and a
favorable external environment. The economy slowed down in 2008 to a growth rate of 3.5
percent, as economic policies were tightened to address overheating. The country‘s strong
macroeconomic framework and the resilience of the financial sector helped cushion the
impact of the global economic crisis. Monetary policy responded swiftly as the policy rate
was lowered from 10 to 3 percent. Fiscal policy also contributed to support aggregate
demand. Countercyclical policies were combined with a flexible exchange rate regime,
which acted as a shock absorber to counter the deceleration in external demand. By 2010, the
economy had largely recovered from the slowdown, although a collapse in exports to
Venezuela has held back some economic expansion. The GDP growth increased by 4.3
percent in 2010 compared with 1.5 percent in 2009.

10.
As the recovery phase consolidates, Colombia is facing economic policy
dilemmas similar to those experienced by other Latin American countries. 1 On the one
hand, the authorities face the challenge of keeping inflation expectations anchored in the face
of higher economic activity and rising inflation. On the other hand, international capital
flows are exerting appreciation pressures on the Colombian Peso and could also prompt
credit booms and asset price bubbles, which would in turn destabilize the financial sector. On
a positive note, the Colombian foreign currency bond credit rating was upgraded to
investment grade for the first time since 1999 by Standard and Poor‘s (in March 2011) and
by Moody‘s (in May 2011). This upgrade gives Colombia access to a new class of investors
and may increase capital inflows further. In a move to return monetary policy to a neutral
stance, the Central Bank increased the policy rate by 125 basis points during 2011, and this
coincided with a slight decline in observed and expected inflation (despite higher global
prices and a weather-related emergency.) The Government has taken a range of measures to
smooth the exchange rate adjustment toward its long-term equilibrium value, including a
program of reserve accumulation (with some sterilization), macro prudential measures, tariff
and tax adjustments, as well as non-monetization of dollar proceeds.
11.
Colombia is experiencing some of the heaviest rainfall in recent history leading
to widespread flooding and landslides. The heavy and prolonged rainfall that peaked in
November and December 2010 (and which re-emerged in April 2011) is largely attributed to
the meteorological phenomenon known as La Niña. Almost 3 million people, especially the
poor, have been directly affected through loss of homes or being seriously deprived of access

to most essential public services. Economic losses are expected to have exceeded 1 percent
of GDP, but the weather shock has not derailed the economic recovery. The impact on food
prices also proved temporary (see Annex C for details). The fiscal cost of the disaster
increased the Central Government deficit by 0.2 and 0.4 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011,
respectively.
C. Macroeconomic Outlook
12.
Colombia’s economy proved to be more resilient than other emerging market
economies, and it is recovering steadily from the effects of the global crisis. This
resilience is linked to a robust macroeconomic framework that rests on three mutually reenforcing pillars: (a) a responsible fiscal policy based on a credible medium-term fiscal
framework and the introduction of a fiscal rule; (b) a monetary policy based on an inflation
targeting regime (Consumer Price Index target of 3.0 percent with a tolerance of +/-1
percent) complemented by a floating exchange rate with moderate interventions; and (c)
sound macro and micro prudential policies combined with a solid financial system. In the
short term, growth and domestic demand is likely to be boosted by consumer and investor
confidence and the reconstruction program, as well as rising export volumes and solid
commodity prices.
13.
The CPS baseline macro projections focus on the short- and medium-term
outlook. The projections incorporate the effects of the 2010 La Niña episode and the
government reconstruction program; the ongoing economic recovery; the latest assumptions
of prospects for the global economy, including higher commodity prices; and recent Central
Bank monetary and exchange rate policy announcements. The CPS baselines macro
projections are summarized as follows:


Growth and inflation. Given the ongoing economic recovery, real GDP is expected to
expand by 4.6 percent in 2011 and to converge to 4.5 percent in the medium term.
Private consumption and private and public investment will sustain domestic demand
growth in the short run. Inflation will stay on target (3 percent) over the projection
period.



Fiscal accounts. The Ministry of Finance has presented a credible economic and
fiscal strategy, which proposes a declining path for the fiscal deficit in 2011-13 in
preparation for meeting the 2014 target stipulated by the new fiscal rule (a structural
deficit of the Central Government of 2.3 percent of GDP). In line with the envisaged
fiscal adjustment for the Central Government, the combined public sector deficit is
also projected to decline from 3.0 percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.7 percent in 2014. As
a result, public debt is declining moderately over the medium term.



External accounts. The current external account deficit widened during the 2010-11
recovery as imports accelerated and factor income outflows increased. In the medium
term, this deficit will narrow again as imports moderate and commodity exports
continue to benefit from solid international prices and higher volumes. The deficit is
largely financed by net foreign direct investment.
4

D. Poverty Level and Trends
14.
Economic growth in recent years has been accompanied by poverty reduction.
Between 2002 and 2009, poverty fell from 53.7 to 45.5 percent while the proportion of the
population that could not satisfy basic nutritional needs (the extreme poor) declined from
19.7 to 16.4 percent. While this is a positive development, Colombia‘s progress in reducing
poverty, given its economic performance since 2002, falls below the performance of regional
peers. Moreover, poverty levels remain relatively high given the country‘s income per capita.
In part, this is explained by an unequal distribution of income, as reflected by the Gini
coefficient, which is among the 10 highest in the world (see Annex D for details.) Food
prices are also relatively higher in Colombia, which among other reasons is associated with
the high cost of transport related to limited competition in the transport sector and unequal
road access.

15.
Labor market rigidities and skill mismatches are also contributing to highincome inequality. Colombian labor markets are still characterized by persistent, high-level
unemployment (close to 12 percent in 2009), as well as pervasive labor informality,
comprising 50-60 percent of the labor force depending on the definition used. Income
generation opportunities for the extreme poor are very limited, with the unemployment rate
close to 35 percent among this population. In addition, gender inequality in the labor markets
contributes directly to inequality but also to further labor market rigidities.2 High minimum
wages and labor costs, misperceptions of social security benefits, skill mismatches between
labor supply and demand, and weak labor intermediation systems explain the poor
performance in these labor market outcomes.
16.
Despite advances, pronounced inequalities remain in terms of access to quality
social services. Capturing coverage of key services necessary for children, Colombia‘s
Human Opportunity Index, while adjusting for fairness in its distribution among the
population, is above the regional average. Encouragingly, between 1997 and 2008, there
were significant improvements in opportunities for children to receive health care; attend
preschool; complete high school; and, along with their families, gain access to electricity and
telephones. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain for provision of social services in
general, particularly in terms of unequal access to safe water, nutrition, food security,
comprehensive early childhood development (ECD), and quality education and health
services (see also Annex C, The Impact of Higher Food and Commodity Prices in
Colombia).
2

The ratio between female and male labor force participation was 0.54 in 2006, lower than the average for lower middleincome countries (World Bank Gender Stats indicators, http://www.worldbank.org/gender ; Data and Statistics). Women
earned about 83 percent less than men after controlling for differences in education, age, and other characteristics; see H.
Nopo, A. Moro, and A. Chong, eds., Discrimination in Latin America: An Economic Perspective (Inter-American
Development Bank, 2009).

III. GOVERNMENT’S VISION AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
17.
In December 2010, the GOC launched its ambitious National Development Plan,
called Prosperity for All 2010–2014 (Prosperidad para Todos 2010–14). The overarching
goals of the NDP are to increase employment, reduce poverty, and improve security. The
NDP has three main objectives: (1) Sustainable Growth and Competitiveness, (2) Equality of
Opportunities for Social Prosperity, and (3) Consolidation of Peace. Moreover, it highlights
four cross-cutting themes: (a) Relevance of International Relations, (b) Environmental and
Disaster Risk Management, (c) Good Governance, and (d) Regional Development and
Integration.
18.
Colombia also wants to strengthen its international image. Diversifying foreign
relations and improving Colombia‘s image abroad are among the main goals of the Santos
Administration. A key priority will be enhancing economic links with Pacific Rim countries
and with countries in South and Central America. The GOC is also actively pursuing
membership of APEC and OECD. For the latter, membership requirements are challenging,
necessitating Colombia to continue addressing democratic as well as sound economic
reforms.
19.
With the new National Development Plan the GOC will retain central elements
of the previous administration’s economic policy, namely attracting foreign investment,
fostering macroeconomic stability, addressing high unemployment and widespread
informality, reducing poverty and inequality, restoring peace and security, and improving the
business environment. Key development challenges include the following areas which are
linked to the WBG program of support: to reduce poverty and inequality; to further raise
human capital development, and to improve the impact of social services.
20.
To reduce poverty and inequality, the social protection system requires further
integration and strengthening of institutional capacities. Although some social insurance
schemes have significantly increased coverage levels, the social protection system as a
whole, including health insurance, requires further integration to improve its reach and
effectiveness. Likewise, the conditional cash transfer program Familias en Accion and the
Juntos program, which focuses on reducing extreme poverty and involves tutors
accompanying poor households to ensure their preferential access to social services, have
significantly improved human capital development and opportunities among poor families;
but enhancing coordination between the two programs remains a critical challenge. In
addition, Familias en Accion and Juntos need to increase both coordination with social
services in a broader way and effective coverage of internally displaced people. Finally,
further creation of formal employment faces significant barriers — high labor costs, the
relevance of skills, and a complex regulatory framework to establish businesses.
21.
To further raise human capital development, Colombia must continue to
develop the education system at all levels. Despite substantial progress over the past
decade, access to quality education remains unequal. Pronounced disparities persist with
poorer regions exhibiting lower average enrollment rates and student achievement levels than
wealthier regions, particularly at the secondary and upper-secondary levels. These disparities
impact the performance of the education system as a whole; given its GDP per capita levels,
Colombia performs subpar on international student assessments such as the Program for

6

International Student Assessment (OECD) and Trends in International Mathematics and
Science Study (International Association for the Evaluation of Education Achievement).
22.
To improve the impact of social services, programs and systems require greater
coordination, enhanced regulation, and accountability. At the core of this challenge are
fragmented and insufficient information systems. The Ministry of Education‘s information
system, for example, does not cover all institutions that manage government resources and
provide education services. As the private (for-profit and not-for-profit) sector continues to
play an increasingly important role in education (about 70 percent in preschool, 20 percent in
primary and secondary education, and 43 percent in higher education), its full inclusion is a
key consideration in further strengthening the education information system as a whole.
Furthermore, institutional mandates of oversight, financing, and service provision within and
across different levels of government remain blurred with often-weak coordination and
accountability mechanisms. For example, some agencies are responsible for both provision
of services and the monitoring and evaluation of said services, which can create perverse
incentives. Combined, these deficiencies can negatively impact performance in Colombia‘s
human development sectors, particularly those that are highly fragmented or involve multiple
actors, such as health and early childhood development.
23.
Colombia has taken significant steps toward the consolidation of peace. Between
2003 and 2009 the number of kidnappings was reduced by nearly 90 percent, acts of
terrorism by more than 80 percent, and subversive activities by 64 percent. In addition,
disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs have also led to
disarmament of 45,000 ex-combatants via collective negotiations with paramilitary groups
and individual demobilizations from left-wing guerrillas. Despite these advances, the
consolidation of peace is still a very complex work in progress. Violence has migrated to the
urban centers and into the border regions; criminals have designed new ways to organize and
operate. More than 150,000 internally displaced families are expecting that their lands,
confiscated by illegal actors, be finally restituted; and around 3 million individuals of the
internally displaced population (IDP) continue struggling in urban areas to find social and
economic opportunities. Efforts to consolidate peace are not confined to police departments
and criminal courts. They are part of a broader initiative involving the whole of Colombian
society, promoting a citizenship culture based on the right and respect for peaceful
coexistence and humanitarian and human rights more broadly, and strengthening and holding
accountable democratic institutions and the justice system. It is essential to tackle the
difficulties in terms of access, efficiency, and effectiveness of Colombia‘s judicial system to
consolidate the peace process in the country that have been stymied by delays, costs, and
complicated processes to access the justice system.
24.
While in recent years progress has been achieved in fostering infrastructure
investments, Colombia lags behind other Latin American countries. Chile, a country
with a smaller population than Colombia, has more than 2,400 kilometers of four-lane
highways compared to only about 800 kilometers in Colombia. The challenges to improving
the quality of public services, including transport and water, sanitation, and solid waste
management, are likely to require regulatory reform, institutional improvements, and
continued public investment and efforts to promote and attract private sector financing for
infrastructure. Management of infrastructure assets, including maintenance, and improved

7

information systems remains a critical challenge within the context of Colombia‘s three-tier
system of decentralized public administration.
25.
Cities have been the engines of Colombia’s economic growth. More than 50
percent of Colombia‘s GDP growth in the last 4 decades can be attributed to economic
development in urban areas. Today, 75 percent of Colombians live among five large cities,
Bogotá, Cali, Medellin, Barranquilla, and Cartagena, which make these urban areas very
densely populated, although economic density remains low. While urbanization rates have
remained high, the quality of urban services has not kept up with the growth of cities. Land
management and housing development for low-income segments of the population is a
critical challenge, which the Santos Administration has identified as a policy priority.
26.
The Santos Administration’s renewed focus on urban services, urban land
development, and expansion of housing for lower-income segments of the urban
population aims to address inequity issues and also stimulate job growth. The
Government‘s National Development Plan clearly highlights the need to manage urban
growth through improvements in public transportation systems, developing financially
sustainable approaches to expanding access to affordable housing, and consolidating many of
the improvements in basic services coverage through improved management and service
quality. Urban environmental issues — particularly in terms of air quality and management
of wastewater — remain equally important challenges.
27.
Colombia is prone to natural disasters. While the extraordinary rainfall that
plagued the country during 2010 and 2011 may not be directly linked to anthropogenic
climate change, it highlights the country‘s continued vulnerability to an array of disaster risks
and the likelihood that adaptation to climatic events will be a priority for this and future
administrations. While Colombia, seen as a leader in managing disaster risk, has a
sophisticated institutional arrangement in place to manage disaster risk, significant work
remains in improving knowledge and risk assessments of territorial management; investing in
critical infrastructure, like drainage systems; and ensuring that institutional reforms and
investment are accompanied by robust enforcement of zoning requirements and building
codes. Colombia‘s critical ecosystems also remain vulnerable to climatic events and the
environmental services provided by many key ecosystems are crucial for the country‘s
continued growth and development.
28.
Environmental management and climate change are increasingly important
areas of policy action in Colombia. Despite Colombia‘s major improvements in
environmental management, environmental degradation affects public health and welfare in a
significant way and compromises the country‘s potential for sustainable economic growth.
Colombia has a long history of environmental and natural resource management policies and
programs aimed to address issues of degradation and resource protection. The Santos
Administration has made clear the centrality of environmental issues in its program, creating
a dedicated Ministry of Environment. The proposed World Bank engagement under the CPS
is wholly aligned with the Government‘s renewed focus on sustainable development,
including positioning Colombia as a leader in the area of climate change.
29.
Colombia faces fiscal challenges related to managing the commodity boom,
social security liabilities, and the risks associated with natural hazards. The economy is
becoming increasingly intensive in commodity production. Oil production rose by 25 percent
8

in 2002–10, from 600,000 to 800,000 barrels per day, while coal production more than
doubled from 40 million to 70 million tons. Macroeconomic challenges arise from the
potential Dutch Disease effect of an appreciating real exchange rate as well as commodity
price volatility, which increases economy-wide uncertainty. Given the fact that both national
and subnational budgets rely on commodity revenue, this can give rise to reduced budget
predictability and stability. Additional fiscal challenges relate to the Government‘s
obligations to provide health care and pension. A strong expansion in subsidized coverage,
rapid growth of demand outside the mandatory benefits package and a policy to harmonize
health benefit packages for all individuals have contributed to rising health care costs.
Meanwhile, pressures on the pension system arise from demographic change, migration of
members from the defined contribution to the defined benefit system, and low coverage
owing to high labor informality. Colombia is experiencing increasing economic losses as a
result of natural hazards. Natural disaster events also represent a substantial fiscal contingent
liability given potential losses to publically owned assets and the private assets of lowincome groups (which the Government would be compelled to partially compensate).
30.
Good governance and increased transparency in Colombia’s economy remains
challenging and is one of the crosscutting priorities of the new Government. Although
considerable progress has been made in improving the effectiveness and credibility of
government institutions, increased transparency, accountability, and effectiveness remain
challenging and require clear definition by the Government. The Government of Colombia
realizes the necessity to increase transparency, improve management capacity, and
strengthen the accountability of public institutions. Furthermore, citizen participation in
politics and public debate, which is essential to generate social capital needs further
encouragement. The subnational governments collectively execute expenditures worth
roughly 10 percent of GDP (about a one-third of total public expenditures); they also raise
roughly 3 percent of GDP in tax revenue. It is critical to improve subnational management
capacity as new functions devolve to subnational governments. In addition to the challenge
of good governance, the performance of public financial management (PFM) systems
including public procurement is a critical factor for fiscal discipline, strategic allocation,
operational efficiency, and transparency in use of public funds. A 2009 World Bank nationallevel PFM and procurement report3 concluded that the PFM system in Colombia possesses a
number of strengths that contribute to fiscal discipline and better control, such as legal
powers to contain budgeted expenditures, timely monitoring of budget execution data and
cash flows, centralization of revenues, and adequate debt management. In terms of
operational efficiency, public procurement could be optimized. Some positive steps in
modernizing the procurement system have been taken. With respect to the legal framework,
for example, in 2007 and 2008, Colombia enacted a new law and associated regulatory
decrees thereby making substantial progress toward bringing the Colombian system close to
internationally agreed standards. Critical work remains in terms of ensuring sustainability of
the procurement reform, including improving country institutional capacity; creating of a
public procurement bureau; enhancing transparency; promoting participation of the private
sector; and creating a more efficient, compliant mechanism.

2009, Report No.: 55113-CO

31.
Aiming to grow at 6 percent per year, Colombia must progress in productivity
and competitiveness to achieve this goal. Colombia's level of productivity is relatively low
in a regional comparison. Low productivity, in turn, is linked to the labor market where a
large proportion of workers and enterprises operate in the informal sector. Informal
enterprises have limited access to credit, do not compete internationally, and have limited
incentives to grow out of the shadow economy. To reduce the informality rate, the
Government must generate an enabling economic environment that encourages formal job
creation, invests in human capital, and manages individual incentives that favor informality.
32.
Colombia is lagging behind countries with similar characteristics in the
development of science, technology, and innovation (STI). Colombia‘s STI sector growth
(amounting to 11.9 percent annual growth in real terms from 2006 to 2009) has outpaced the
economy‘s growth rate. As a result, investments in the sector have helped to expand basic
infrastructure services to support STI development. In spite of these efforts, total investment
in research and development in Colombia remains relatively low. It is 0.2 percent of GDP,
compared to Argentina, which invests 0.5 percent; Chile, 0.7 percent; Brazil, 0.8 percent; and
South Korea, 3.2 percent. The National Development Plan and the ―Plan Vive Digital
Colombia‖ emphasize the Government‘s commitment to scale up investments into research
and development and to address pending regulatory bottlenecks to reap its full potential. In
particular, the Government aims to address (a) organizational weaknesses; (b) the insufficient
use of mechanisms to protect intellectual property rights; (c) limited access to financial
instruments for innovative enterprises; (d) insufficient qualified human capital in relevant
areas with an emphasis on innovation; and (e) insufficient incentives to retain the
Colombians living abroad who have the potential to contribute to STI development.

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP
A. Lessons Learned from Previous CPS and Stakeholder Feedback
33.
CPS Completion Report. World Bank Group assistance to Colombia, an upper
middle-income country with the third largest portfolio in Latin America and the seventh
Bank-wide, offers lessons that are relevant to future Bank engagements with the country and
with other middle-income countries. Overall, the FY2008–2011 CPS program performance is
rated ―satisfactory‖ having achieved good progress toward all major expected outcomes. In
this context, the Bank, in close coordination with the borrower, has incorporated a broad set
of measures into both project implementation and supervision to strengthen the overall
fiduciary control framework and to safeguard individual operations.
34.
The previous CPS was designed to be flexible and innovative in responding to
Colombia’s financial and development needs. This flexibility has allowed the World Bank
to explore new avenues of resources, mainly through trust funds, that financed unanticipated
Government requests for knowledge and advisory services. Just-in-time technical assistance
tailored for particular requests, policy dialogue, global knowledge transfer, and a fully
integrated trust fund portfolio resulted in an important and innovative aspect of the program.
While trust fund resources were not predictable at the outset of the CPS, the Bank ensured
selectivity during implementation so that these resources were aligned with Government
priorities. Colombia was also one of the first Bank clients to take advantage of the flexible
10

development policy loan (DPL) with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO)
as part of its integrated approach to disaster risk management. Combined with the other
ongoing activities by the Bank — spanning the range of financial and knowledge services —
Colombia has one of the most integrated programs in risk management of any Bank client.
Its multi-year, knowledge and advisory programmatic approach, where IBRD had an ongoing engagement with the Government in key areas, defined the annual work program (for
knowledge and convening services) according to the existing needs at the time. The IFC
advisory program also expanded in Colombia, and its services were also based on strategic
aims. This flexibility and just-in-time, multi-sectoral programmatic advisory approach
proved to be effective and should be maintained.
35.
While all countries face risks, sound economic management, efficient and
transparent institutions, good governance, and proactive social investments help
mitigate the potential impact of internal and external risks. A strong institutional
framework and an overall government commitment to a coherent development effort
facilitate the design and implementation of a flexible, client-driven, assistance program.
Looking forward it is important to agree with the authorities on an integrated package of
financial, knowledge, and convening services with a focus on providing customized resultsfocused development solutions in areas where the World Bank Group can add value.
36.
Engagement with Colombia is also effective on knowledge transfer utilizing the
Colombian experience to the benefit of other, less-developed countries. Continued WBG
engagement with Colombia offers a win-win situation as already shown with the mass transit
system in Bogotá as well as the nationwide conditional cash transfer program Familias en
Accion, which are similar to programs being developed in other countries around the world.
37.
Stakeholder feedback. In August 2010, after presidential elections, the WBG team
engaged promptly with the new authorities. The WBG team prepared a set of thematic policy
notes followed by an all-day meeting with President Santos and Government officials to
discuss the new Government‘s potential priority areas, provide early input into the new
National Development Plan, and seek feedback for the Bank‘s new CPS.
38.
Following these discussions the Government began formulating its National
Development Plan, which was then subject to an extensive national consultation
process. The exercise drew on the input of 16 administrative departments and an ample
range of stakeholders from academia, NGOs, private sector, unions, the media, and — for the
first time — indigenous peoples groups. As part of the CPS process, the Bank participated
selectively in relevant Government consultation events. Given the extensive Government
consultations on the National Development Plan and the relatively limited scope of the WBG
in support of the National Development Plan, the WBG will continue to hold systematic
stakeholder consultations in the process of developing new operational engagements and at
mid- term CPS implementation.
39.
In addition, to complement the Government’s consultation efforts, the Bank
carried out a national client survey. The survey process took place between February and
March 2011, and offered some important inputs for the preparation of this CPS. Overall,
stakeholders identified as the top development priorities in Colombia: (a) the reduction of
poverty; (b) enhanced economic growth and employment generation; (c) improved education
access and quality; and (d) peace. The survey suggests that the Bank is perceived to be
11

involved in some top development areas such as poverty and growth but less so in education
where a plurality would like to see the Bank more involved. Respondents were mainly from
government agencies (60 percent), followed by civil society organizations (18 percent),
private sector (10 percent), academia (10 percent), and media (2 percent). For details, see
Annex G.
B. Proposed WBG Partnership Strategy
40.
The CPS aims to support selectively the new National Development Plan. The
WBG will step up efforts to enhance development impact through selectivity, as a means to
provide added value to the country. The WBG will carry out activities for which the
Government or the private sector have expressed explicit need either through financial,
knowledge, or convening services. These activities are combined as a results-focused
package of support grouped under three strategic themes: (a) Expanding Opportunities for
Social Prosperity; (b) Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate Change Resilience; and (c)
Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity. Each of these strategic themes has three areas
of results with specified outcomes. The WBG aims to contribute toward these outcomes (as
detailed in Table 3, 4, and 5 throughout the discussion of each theme below). In some cases,
outcomes in this CPS cannot solely be attributed to the WBG since activities are often jointly
accomplished with the Government or other partners.
41.
The programs under these strategic themes reflect the current dialogue with the
authorities and include the ongoing portfolio as well as new activities running until
FY13. Within the framework of the National Development Plan, new activities beyond FY13
will be identified in agreement with the Government to acknowledge the needed flexibility,
and responsiveness to emerging requests. The CPS Progress Report, which is envisaged after
the next presidential election in 2014, will provide an update on the WBG engagement.
42.
The IFC expects to continue expanding its activities in Colombia supporting the
National Development Plan. The IFC investments and advisory engagements will largely
focus on enhancing the competitiveness of Colombia‘s private sector, and on increasing its
capacity to generate new jobs. The IFC aims to support the private sector-oriented adult
education sector, especially technical and vocational training for low- and middle-income
students. Education is a critical factor in reducing inequality as well as raising productivity.
Experience in other countries, such as Brazil, shows that working adults can double or triple
their incomes on graduation. IFC has already built up considerable experience in Colombia
through its support for Uniminuto, a network of not-for-profit colleges, which enrolled
26,500 students in 2009.
43.
The IFC aims to enhance Colombia’s infrastructure and logistics by expanding
its work on structuring public–private partnership (PPP) projects in cooperation with
government agencies. The IFC also intends to further improve Colombia‘s investment
climate and trade logistics through its advisory services arm. The IFC expects to build on an
active range of projects in Colombia currently focused on trade logistics and simplification of
business registration processes. The IFC advisory services expect to expand with royalty
management projects in the growing extractives sector. The IFC intends to increase financing
of Colombian financial institutions, especially those focused on small and medium-size
enterprises, low-income communities, and women. While small businesses typically employ
12

more workers than larger companies, insufficient financing affects their ability to survive and
grow.
44.
The IFC also intends to maintain its commitment to corporate governance, an
important issue given its substantial equity investments in Colombia and its ability to
promote best practices in the field. Equity investments account for one-third of IFC‘s
outstanding investments in Colombia. Housing may also become a growth area, with IFC
supporting mortgage loans that benefit low- and middle-income groups. And IFC expects to
ramp up its offering of technical as well as financial support for green-building codes and
construction methods.
45.
Finally, the World Bank is offering its help to the Government in leveraging
different sources of financing through its convening power, financial expertise, and
relations. The Bank will work with Colombia to deliver financial structure to effectively
leverage additional sources of financing and to tap into capital markets (e.g., Green Bond,
Carbon Emission Rights sales contracts, joint financings, etc). In summary, Colombia has
been a regional leader in the use of WBG risk management products and new financial
structure and is expected to continue taking full advantage of WBG financial products.

Expanding Opportunities for Social Prosperity
46.
Despite the slow decline of poverty and inequality over the last decade, Colombia has
continued to strengthen its social policies to expand opportunities to the majority of the
population. These efforts are concentrated in (a) enhancing social promotion and citizen
security through increased coverage of safety nets and social protection programs for the
poor and violence afflicted; (b) expanding educational opportunities for all; and (c)
improving the performance of basic social services, such as those related to health, early
childhood development, and education. The Bank has been an important partner in this
effort, through investment loans and DPLs, grants, knowledge and convening services, and
in-time technical assistance at Government‘s request.

13

Enhanced Social Promotion and Improved Citizens Security
47.
Enhanced social promotion is critical in the fight against poverty and more
broadly against inequality. The Bank has been supporting the development of Colombia‘s
social promotion system since the inception of the conditional cash transfer program
Familias en Accion almost a decade ago. Since then, it has provided advice in the design,
implementation, and evaluation of the Juntos and most recently Unidos anti-poverty strategy.
Furthermore, its multi-year programs of knowledge and convening services have gone
beyond supporting the social promotion system to promoting inclusive, equitable, and
efficient social protection for all Colombians. In the future, these services will focus on the
development and implementation of the National Plan for Social Prosperity — that will
include analyses to support the Unidos strategy, which aims to improve the coordination and
strengthening of the Familias en Accion and Juntos programs, helping ensure the alignment
with other social services and income-generation and active labor market programs — and
review of existing capacity and international experiences to develop a platform to promote
social innovation. The Bank has also been supporting development of Colombia‘s social
protection system through operations and advisory services, focused on achieving (a) greater
integration, efficiency, and equity of social insurance through expansion of information
systems for social security contributions and the centralized registry of beneficiaries of all
social programs; (b) improvement of the targeting, efficiency, and articulation of social
assistance programs (SISBEN); and (c) promotion of higher-quality training and employment
services, as well as a strategy to promote income generation among the extreme poor,
including social innovation and approaches that involve the private sector. Potential areas of
knowledge services include support for the creation of a system that promotes labor market
competencies and tackles barriers to employability, and design of temporary employment
programs and a national labor intermediation system.
48.
The Bank is supporting Colombia’s efforts to achieve lasting peace and greater
gender equity. The country‘s recent history has been marred by violence and armed
conflicts that have precluded it from reaching its full development potential. Violence has
displaced a large portion of the population. The Bank is actively supporting the joint efforts
by the Government and the international community with knowledge and convening services
as well as trust fund financing. The ongoing Peace and Development Project aims to assist
vulnerable, low-income, and displaced populations in rural and urban communities in the
conflict-affected regions; this assistance comes by reducing risk of further exposure to
violence and mitigating the negative impact of possible derived effects. The Bank is also
implementing a grant to protect the land and patrimony of internally displaced populations.
The Bank plans to continue work in peace and development through technical assistance and
several grants that will focus on youth at risk, Afro descendants, ex-combatants, displaced
populations, gender issues, and strengthening policies and institutions to protect human
rights. Given the high number of people affected by conflict in the country (about 15 percent
of the total population), the Bank will continue to support Colombia in improving strategies
to assist internally displaced populations in a comprehensive and sustainable way.
49.
Critical gender issues in Colombia include labor markets segmentation,
domestic violence, and early childbearing. Gender issues are fully integrated in the WBG
program and in addition the Bank offers several grants with a concrete focus on gender
issues, specifically among IDPs. These are designed to (a) increase the economic
14

empowerment of women in IDP communities; (b) assist these women to join the formal labor
force; (c) build the assets of internally displaced women (including greater food security); (d)
help understanding of the causes of political and/or domestic violence against women and
develop tools to mitigate it; and (e) increase participation of women in the Peace and
Development Project. A recent review of this work by the Bank‘s Internal Evaluation Group
highlights the need to support gender equality in the area of employment and opportunities;
as a direct consequence, the Bank is closely engaged in supporting the Secretary for
Women‘s Issues in the Presidency with an initiative to certify those businesses and
enterprises that adopt gender-neutral employment policies.
Improved Opportunities in Education
50.
In order to support continued economic growth and reductions in poverty and
inequality, it is imperative that Colombia raise human capital development by
improving opportunities in education at all levels. This includes improving quality in preschool, basic, and secondary levels; promoting relevance in upper secondary, including
vocational and technical education; and increasing enrollment while decreasing dropouts at
the tertiary level. The World Bank will continue to support Colombia in these efforts through
several projects. The ongoing second phase of an adaptable program loan (APL) for the
Rural Education Project further expands opportunities for non-urban students by
supporting increased delivery of educational resources and implementation of flexible
education models in rural areas. The Antioquia Upper Secondary Education Project
supports the Department of Antioquia‘s efforts to improve access, retention, and outcomes
among upper-secondary schools to improve the employability of young people and increase
labor force competitiveness. The Education Quality Project aims to improve the design,
application, evaluation, and use of assessments to inform policies and initiatives to enhance
the quality of education. The first phase and upcoming second phase of an APL for the
Student Loan Support Project has been instrumental in increasing enrollment and
graduation rates among tertiary students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
Complementary to the financial services, the Bank is involved in a multi-year Program of
Knowledge Services, Skills for Shared Growth, as well as convening services to support
GOC efforts to increase education quality and skill formation, identify determinants of
student learning in order to better inform policy and improve technical and institutional
capacity to conduct research, and to monitor and evaluate education policies and programs.
In FY13, the program will include a joint World Bank/OECD review of the tertiary education
system.
51.
The IFC plan to increase its operations in adult education, with a focus on technical
and vocational training, fits well with this approach. The IFC aims to reach low-income
students either through direct financing for technical and vocational colleges, or possibly
through a loan program designed to meet students‘ needs. Complementary to these projects,
the World Bank will continue to provide a multi-year program of knowledge and convening
services to support efforts to increase education quality and skill formation. These services
will include, among other activities, an assessment of teacher performance, policy notes on
technical education, and the establishment of a comprehensive database of learning outcomes
that allows tracking progress across various student assessments and the effect of time
changes on overall student performance.
15

Improved Performance of Social Services
52.
Improving the performance of social services hinges on strengthening
information systems and planning, coordination and accountability at and across all
levels of government. In support of these goals, the World Bank will continue to provide a
multi-year program of knowledge and convening services. In the short term, this program
will assess the information systems in health, early childhood development, and education,
and will issue recommendations to strengthen the systems using innovative information
technologies and platforms. In health and early child development, the program will also
assess accountability arrangements between central and local governments. In early
childhood development, Bank efforts will support development of the national multi-sector
strategy, De Cero a Siempre, which aims to consolidate currently fragmented efforts to
provide young children of all families, particularly the poorest, with access to high-quality,
comprehensive ECD services.
53.
The multi-year program of knowledge and convening services will be complemented
through a DPL and three trust fund-financed projects. The enhancing governance and
accountability arrangements of health insurance schemes in Mexico, Colombia and Peru
seeks to analyze the current situation and explore options to enhance current organizational
arrangements and information systems for improving governability of health insurance in
Colombia. Implementing the Right to Health through Universal Health Insurance
Project aims to strengthen participation of academic centers and civil society in developing
instruments and foster dialogue on how to fairly and efficiently ensure rights in health.
Furthermore, a Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience DPL series will support the
adoption of critical legal and regulatory reforms to better manage fiscal pressures stemming
from the harmonization of benefit packages among population groups and to improve
reimbursement practices and enhance the financial sustainability of the health system as a
whole. In FY12, the Bank is also supporting the GOC with the Strengthening Governance
of Early Childhood Development Programs (SFLAC grant), which includes provision of
continued knowledge services to help improve coordination and governance arrangements
under the ECD service delivery system, rationalize the existing complex set of overlapping
programs, and design and provide technical assistance to implement a comprehensive
information system for monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Colombia Enhancing
Governance, Transparency, and Accountability in Education Project (IDF grant) aims to
strengthen education efficiency through improved monitoring, accountability, and oversight
of the sector, including the establishment of a superintendence of education.

Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate Change Resilience
54.
The areas of sustainable urban development, environmental management, resilience
to climate change, and disaster risk mitigation are high priorities for the World Bank‘s
engagement under this CPS. These activities have gained prominence given the challenges of
meeting Colombia‘s ambitious plans for growth and economic development with the explicit
policy objectives of the new administration to make development environmentally and
socially sustainable. The Bank-supported program aims to continue addressing the needs of
Colombia‘s highly urbanized population – through better land management, improved

16

services, and governance – while maintaining Colombia‘s position as an international leader
in environmental management.

Seventy-five percent of Colombians live in cities. Colombia‘s largest city, Bogotá is
home to 8 million; with 18,000 people per square kilometer, it is the densest populated city in
the Western hemisphere. At the other end of the spectrum lie 927 municipalities with fewer
than 20,000 people, fairly dispersed across the national landscape. Population density is the
signature of Colombian cities, but economic densities are low. Bogotá, Medellín, and
Bucaramanga rank among the 50 most densely populated cities in the world. Urbanization
has stimulated the concentration of people and jobs, generating economies of scale and
agglomeration. The urban economy has contributed much to Colombia‘s economic progress.
Building on industry and services, the urban sector has contributed more than 50 percent to
GDP growth over the past 40 years. A key goal of the Government‘s new National
Development Plan is to improve the urban living environment, which includes improving
access to and quality of basic services, improving the urban environment, and expanding
access to affordable housing solutions for the poor.
56.
Over the last 30 years the World Bank has supported Colombia‘s urban development
agenda on the national as well as subnational levels in urban housing, transport, solid waste
management, and water and sanitation; and the Bank‘s current portfolio reflects the centrality
of urban services and environment. The Bogotá Urban Services Project assists the District
of Bogotá to implement a strategic portion of its 3-year Development Plan through urban
transport solutions to improve mobility and strengthening of the cadastre system. The Bank
is also supporting the development of sustainable urban transport in large and medium-sized
cities through the Government‘s pioneering and widely recognized National Urban
Transport Program (NUTP), which supports the financing of sustainable public transport
systems. The IFC may expand a successful subnational financing program for urban
improvement to other cities. In 2010, IFC committed a US$45 million senior loan to the
metropolitan municipality of Bogotá to finance its 2007-2008 capital expenditure program
and rehabilitation of streets, sidewalks, and bike paths. In the near term, Colombia is likely to
access the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) resources to further develop low-carbon solutions
17

for expanded public transport (a CTF Investment Plan totaling US$100 million was approved
in 2010).
57.
In the area of water and sanitation, the GOC has been a leader in adopting
sound water sector policies. Among the forerunners of decentralization, the GOC
established a legal framework that clearly separates service provision from policy-making,
thus allowing private sector participation. The key to success in the Colombian water sector
reform has been the development of homegrown solutions and at times the skillful adaptation
of models (successfully used elsewhere) suited to particular circumstances and culture of
Colombia. As a result, Colombia has made substantial progress in the expansion of water
supply and sanitation services. As of 2010, urban water supply access was over 95 percent
(rural water supply coverage was 71 percent) although service quality remains uneven.
Sanitation access has also improved significantly in recent years with urban coverage of over
90 percent. Over the years, the World Bank has supported Colombia through advisory work,
capacity building, and lending services. Since 1988, the World Bank has provided a series of
loans with a total value of over US$700 million to the Colombian water supply and sanitation
sector. The IFC is helping to finance Barranquilla‘s water and sewer system with a US$10.9
million guarantee, and hopes similar risk management structures or direct financing
programs can be used to support local infrastructure projects. Remaining challenges in the
sector include the need to improve multi-city service quality, improve access in rural areas,
and dramatically improve wastewater management.
58.
Ongoing operations within the sector include the La Guajira Water and Sanitation
Infrastructure and Service Management Project, which aims to support the development
of financial sustainable utilities in one of Colombia‘s lagging departments and to improve the
quality of basic service delivery in La Guajira‘s 15 municipalities. The Rio Bogotá
Environmental Recuperation and Flood Control Project is an example to urban water
quality management, which aims to transform the Río Bogotá — a terribly polluted open
sewer — into an environmental asset for the District of Bogotá by improving water quality,
reducing flood risks, and creating multi-functional areas along the river.
59.
Among the challenges of solid waste management in Colombia, a significant
proportion of solid waste is disposed of inadequately. Colombia‘s 1,102 municipalities
produce approximately 28,800 tons of solid waste per day. Approximately 35 percent, or
10,000 tons per day, of this waste is generated in Bogotá, Cali, Medellin, and Barranquilla,
while medium-size cities and smaller municipalities generate the remaining 65 percent, or
18,800 tons per day. It is estimated that a large proportion of this waste is inadequately
disposed in open-air dumps, bodies of water, and other environmentally sensitive sites.
Inadequate disposal results in environmental and health problems that include surface and
groundwater contamination, air pollution, and increased vector-transmitted (flies and
rodents) illnesses. The Bank has a solid waste management project under implementation
that helps to address some of these key issues through public–private partnerships for the
development and management of multi-municipal regional sanitary landfills.
60.
In the area of housing and urban land management, the Bank supports a broad
thematic engagement related to a range of issues, from development of financial instruments
for financing of urban investment to creation of public–private solutions for mixed-use and
low-income housing. The Bank has been working closely with a range of actors within the
GOC and civil society in what the Santos Administration considers one of five ―engines of
18

growth‖ under the National Development Plan. The Bank‘s work includes financial support
(through the Macroproyectos project); a range of knowledge services and delivery of justin-time technical guidance; and the use of the Bank‘s convening power, which included a
visit by a high-level Colombian delegation to Washington, D.C., to help develop options for
establishing tools, such as tax increment financing for developing urban infrastructure and
urban renovation. This engagement is likely to continue in the coming years, especially given
the National Development Plan‘s focus on regional differentiation and development of a
multi-polar growth dynamic led by urban revitalization.
Enhanced Disaster Risk Management
61.
Natural disasters are a challenge to sustainable development in Colombia.
Colombia’s high rate of urbanization, compounded by the location of major cities in
high-risk areas, and considerable environmental degradation have brought with them
growing vulnerability to adverse natural events. Population growth and the increasing
concentration of settlements, assets, and infrastructure mean that vulnerability to natural
hazard events is on the rise. This, combined with global climate change and the expected
increased climatic variability, is likely to exacerbate the country‘s exposure to floods,
erosion, landslide, and drought. Annually, Colombia suffers from more than 600 natural
disasters. In the past 30 years, Colombia has experienced 6 major earthquakes, 4 volcanic
eruptions, major landslides, and extensive flooding. Recognizing that disasters are most
effectively dealt with before they happen, Colombia has over the past 2 decades
institutionalized a system for comprehensive disaster risk management that among other
things seeks to reduce vulnerability by investing in risk mitigation, environmental
management, and strengthening the integration of disaster risk management in urban and
territorial planning. Improving Colombia‘s disaster risk management has been a central
theme of the Government‘s overall policy program since 2002. Since 2004, the Government
requested preparation of an APL series to support the implementation of its disaster risk
management policies. Two loans are under implementation.
62.
The APL I, which finances investment by the Central Government, addresses the
sector issues through components based on the 5 lines of action — (a) risk identification, (b)
risk reduction, (c) institutional development, (d) risk awareness, and (e) risk financing —
including activities aimed at increasing the effectiveness of investments in disaster risk
mitigation and at addressing the need for contingency plans to cover fiscal shortfalls in case
of a major catastrophe. The APL II, a direct loan to the District of Bogotá, aims at reducing
the vulnerability of the Capital District of Bogotá to adverse natural events, by strengthening
its capacity to manage disaster risks, and by reducing vulnerability in key sectors. The
project will contribute to the District‘s long-term program to save lives and reduce social,
economic, and financial losses resulting from earthquakes, floods, landslides, and other
adverse natural events.
63.
In December 2010 during the country‘s worst rainy season in decades, the World
Bank disbursed a DPL with a deferred drawdown option linked to catastrophic events (CAT
DDO of US$150 million) to support Colombia in the face of the humanitarian emergency.
The use of the CAT DDO reflects the Government‘s interest in expanding the use of
innovative financing instruments to develop a comprehensive risk financing strategy. As in
19

other areas, the Bank‘s engagement in disaster risk management spans the broad range of
lending, technical assistance, and knowledge services that support a variety of actors within
Central Government, at the local level and in civil society. Given the focus on disaster risk
issues as a result of the rains and flooding of 2010/2011 and the Bank‘s experience in helping
the GOC effectively, it is likely that additional work in this area will take place that could
include new lending operations for further financing of the APL series, a new CAT DDO,
and subnational operations, including in Barranquilla (a flood protection project), as well as a
continued engagement in technical assistance and other knowledge work. The Bank will also
explore synergies between assisting internally displaced people and people affected by
natural disasters, given the large numbers and geographical coincidences of these two
groups.
Improved Environmental Management and Climate Change Resilience
64.
As one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth, Colombia faces serious
challenges related to environmental degradation, which affects public health and
welfare and compromises the country’s potential for sustainable economic growth. An
analysis of the costs of environmental degradation in Colombia indicates that the most
significant costs are associated with urban environmental challenges — inadequate water,
sanitation, and hygiene and ambient and indoor air pollution, mainly from increased child
morbidity and mortality. Colombia also faces great challenges and opportunities on the
―green‖ environment side related to protecting critical ecosystems, developing strategies and
instruments for the sustainable use and protection of its rich forest resources, and taking
advantage of the new climate financing instruments under development. The country‘s
remarkable efforts to protect large amounts of its national territory put it in an excellent
position to emerge as a leader in forest protection and environmental management. The CPS
envisages a broad engagement in integrating environmental principles in sectoral policies (in
particular those of the growth engines, such as infrastructure and mining), urban
environmental management, ecosystem protection, and forestry and water resources
management; this will most likely extend to potentially scaled-up engagement in climate
change mitigation and adaptation, which seems to have taken on a new emphasis under the
Santos Administration. In this context, the Bank is also helping to facilitate nascent work in
developing a strategy for conservation and sustainable development in the Colombian
Amazon, which might focus on supporting the needs of the Amazon‘s indigenous peoples
who are disproportionately affected by poverty and violence.
65.
In recent years, the Bank has been actively assisting the Government of Colombia
with a policy-based program of reforms that have been highly successful and have been
accompanied by a program of technical assistance under the Sustainable Development
Investment Project. This programmatic engagement aims to strengthen the Government‘s
program for reducing environmental degradation in Colombia and is likely to continue and
expand under the new CPS. This policy and knowledge engagement has gone hand in hand
with a number of grant-financed and carbon finance activities. These activities include but
are not limited to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Integrated National
Adaptation Project, a national program to define and implement specific pilot climate
change adaptation; the GEF-funded Colombian National Protected Areas Conservation
Trust Fund Project (soon to enter a stage of additional finance) that supports the
20

development of the National Protected Areas System by consolidating a Biodiversity and
Protected Areas Trust Fund; and the GEF Sustainable Cattle Ranching Project, which
supports the development of silvopastoril cattle ranching systems that greatly improve
environmental management, provide financial and economic benefits to participating cattle
farms, and incorporate an environmental services payment element for development of
critical biodiversity corridors.
66.
The IFC sees strong potential demand in Colombia for its suite of climate-related
products. These include credit lines for banks to support energy efficiency projects for
corporate clients as well as direct financing to manufacturers to raise energy efficiency levels
to boost operating margins as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The IFC also intends
to support energy efficient building codes through its investment operations and advisory
service projects.
67.
In the new CPS period, the Bank is likely to be deeply involved in environmental
management issues in Colombia, spanning urban environmental issues, forestry, climate
change, biodiversity protection, and water management. And from an institutional point of
view, the integration of environmental principles in sectoral policies could have a
significantly high environmental footprint, unless environmental factors are considered in
their expansion plans. At this moment, activities are ongoing to develop a national lowcarbon growth strategy to address a range of urban environmental issues (including through
operations mentioned above) and to help Colombia take advantage of its vast human capacity
and strong legal and institutional framework in ensuring that the institutional and governance
aspects of environmental management are strengthened.

Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity
Colombia also faces the challenge to achieve faster and more inclusive economic
growth. The National Development Plan sets out to increase the country‘s growth rate from
4 to 6 percent, cut the unemployment from 12 to 9 percent, and reduce the Gini coefficient of
income inequality from 0.58 to 0.54. Achieving these challenging targets require policy
efforts geared toward developing the country‘s natural and human resources into such a
pattern that accelerates growth and shares its benefits with broad segments of the population.
In particular, it requires skillful management of risks and fiscal policy challenges associated
with natural resources wealth and careful monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs
conducive to inclusive growth. Transparent and effective public sector institutions (at federal
and subnational levels) and a friendly business environment will also facilitate this growth.
And in support of innovation and entrepreneurship for higher productivity, the development
in the financial sector must deliver efficient and stable services with access for all people.
The Bank is supporting the Colombian Government in this endeavor through an array of
financial and knowledge services discussed below.
68.

Improved Fiscal, Financial, and Social Risk Management
69.
Colombia has made good progress on the fiscal front over the past decade as
illustrated by substantial reduction in public debt by about ten percentage points since
2002. Yet, as previously discussed, the country faces fiscal challenges related to increased
fiscal reliance on commodity revenues, substantial social security liabilities, and fiscal risks
associated with natural hazards.
70.
The Santos Administration is pursuing fiscal reforms aimed at addressing some of
these challenges. A new fiscal rule sets a deficit target for 2014 and commits the Government
to undertake a medium-term fiscal adjustment of about 1.5 percentage points of GDP. The
rule targets a Central Government structural balance by 2022. The fiscal rule legislation also
introduces a savings and stabilization fund to reduce budget volatility associated with an
increased fiscal reliance on commodities revenues (primarily oil, coal, and metals). A reform
of the royalties system, which directs revenues from natural resources exploration toward
subnational entities, complements these efforts by introducing a stabilization fund at the
decentralized level. Congress has also approved an amendment to the Constitution that
introduces fiscal sustainability as a criterion. The Government has also taken measures to
reduce social security spending through legislative and administrative measures in the health
sector, and it is preparing a financing strategy to mitigate fiscal risks from natural hazards.
The Government‘s fiscal management program represents a substantial effort in tackling
22

these challenges. Further progress, for instance in reforming the pension system, would
nonetheless be warranted even following successful implementation of the reform program.
71.
Colombia has focused for many years in managing the risk reduction of its debt
portfolio through a substantial increase in the share of local currency and fixed interest rate,
the extension of maturities, and the smoothing out of the debt redemption profile. To meet
the goals of its debt management strategy, Colombia has taken full advantage of IBRD
financial products, both at the federal and subnational levels. As Colombia proceeds with
active liability management of its debt portfolio in the future, it is expected that the country
will continue using the embedded conversion options of IBRD loans to fix the interest rate or
convert the loan currency into Colombian Pesos. In addition, Colombia has signed a Master
Derivatives Agreement with IBRD that gives it access to a wider menu of financial products
to manage risks related to commodity, weather, and natural disasters. The Master Derivatives
Agreement would also help hedge the currency exposure generated by bond issuance in
international markets in different currencies (e.g., in Japan). Subnationals, which have
revenues in local currency (e.g., Bogotá, ICETEX), are also expected to continue with the
practice of converting their loan disbursements into Colombian Pesos.
72.
Colombia is in the process of developing a broader approach to sovereign risk
management. The country lacks a comprehensive fiscal risk analysis of the balance sheet as
well as a specific framework for the design and implementation of a holistic risk
management strategy capable of deliberating between (a) risk absorption capacity, (b) risk
retention and transfer, (c) policy advice and institutional capacity for managing risk, and (d)
potential financial products available for strategy implementation. Colombian authorities and
the World Bank have enjoyed a long-lasting and fruitful partnership on issues relating to
sovereign debt management in general and the reduction of financial vulnerabilities in
particular, with Colombia being a regional leader in the use of the Bank‘s risk management
products and services. As part of this ongoing partnership, the World Bank is assisting the
Government of Colombia as it endeavors to develop and implement a more comprehensive
sovereign risk management agenda (see Annex E for details).
73.
The World Bank also supports the Government‘s fiscal management program through
a multi-sectoral, programmatic package of financial, knowledge, and convening services.
Financial services include a DPL series (FY12-13) that support greater budget predictability
and stability, improved management of public sector contingent liabilities, and improved
disaster risk financing management. Knowledge services range from economic modeling
support to commodity risks management. In the area of convening services, the Bank
organizes various seminars with high-level government officials on royalties‘ reform,
disaster risk management, and management of public sector liabilities.
74.
The Bank is also supporting efforts to strengthen the Colombian financial sector,
which is considered underdeveloped. Data shows that different measures of financial
system development are below the expected medium value given GDP per capita, size and
demographics and is also below the regional media for LAC countries. Sound financial
sector development is necessary to fund productive investment, to increase productivity, and
to sustain growth. To this end, there is work underway to strengthen financial sector
oversight, develop the financial sector, and improve access to finance. In the area of financial
sector strengthening, the Bank plans to provide knowledge and advisory services in forms of
(a) a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), with its recommendations,
23

including financial architecture, regulation, and supervision; (b) a review of the pension
system; (c) continued ongoing work on capital markets development through the Efficient
Securities Markets Institutional Development (ESMID) program. Furthermore, work to
strengthen financial literacy and consumer protection is underway namely through analytical
work to understand the financial management practices of the Colombian population and
technical assistance to the financial sector on fee structures. In social risk management, the
Bank will provide advisory services to improve the Government‘s ability to monitor social
welfare impacts of crises (and related responses) at the national and local level. The Bank
will also step in to strengthen the capacity of the Government and communities to prepare for
crises. This work will include development of a management information system for social
risk management and approval of a SFLAC recipient-executed grant to strengthen social risk
management capacity at the Department of National Planning (DNP).
Improved Public Sector Management and Equity and Efficiency of Economic Policies
75.
Colombian authorities have been focused on enhancing the equity, efficiency,
and effectiveness of economic policies and public administration for more than two
decades. Progress has been notable under the last two administrations, and the political
commitment was renewed by the new Administration that put enhancing public sector
management as a top priority in the National Development Plan. The Bank supports the GOC
Good Governance and Decentralization Programs with specific focus in the national
government‘s management institutions, the decentralization framework, and the governance
and public management capacities at subnational level of government.
76.
The Bank‘s support in this area include the Consolidation of National Public
Management Information Systems Project that aims to improve transparency and interoperability of the Government‘s main management information systems. The Subnational
Institutional Strengthening Investment Loan, planned for FY12, will support the
implementation of the decentralization reforms and the Government‘s strategy to improve
governance and institutional capacities in subnational governments. The IFC hopes to expand
its royalty management program in Colombia. There are three active projects in the country
that are assisting local governments to improve transparency and accountability in their use
of payments from extractive industry operations.
77.
Knowledge and advisory services will seek to strengthen territorial development
through improved management capacities in departments and municipal governments.
Bank assistance will focus on strengthening human resource management, financial
management, and coordination with local organizations (public, private, and civil society).
Specific activities include the design and piloting of the Rapid Assessments and Action
Plans Methodology, which aims to improve management capacities in departments and
municipal governments. In addition, a diagnostic and strategic planning tool based on the
Capacity Development and Results Framework is being applied to assess and address
institutional capacities of demand and supply-side institutions at the subnational level. The
Bank also provides advisory services on the implementation of the Citizen’s Visible Audits
Methodology, which promotes civil society participation and control in the execution of
public investments. The regional study ―Fiscal Federalism/Decentralization in LAC” also
contributes to generate and share knowledge on good practice related to intergovernmental
24

arrangements. Convening services include organization of workshops on mechanisms to
improve national government tools to assess public management capacities at subnational
level and to regulate and supervise the delivery of services by subnational governments; and
the exchange of international experiences on policies to improve coordination among central
and subnational governments as well as on budget management to improve expenditure
efficiency.
78.
In the past few years, Colombia has also demonstrated a good track record in
implementing public financial management. The Colombian PFM systems at central level
perform close to international good practice, albeit with a few areas needing further
improvement. The Bank has supported strengthening of the financial management and
oversight systems in the country by using different financing instruments and advisory
services to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, Department of National Planning,
Supreme Audit Institutions, and National Accounting Office. In accordance with the Bank
and regional governance and anti-corruption strategies, the Bank‘s financial management
support to increase good governance and transparency during the CPS period will focus on
(a) increasing reliance in PFM country systems (strengthening the capacity and independence
of the Supreme Audit Institution); (b) increasing transparency at national and subnational
levels by continuing with provision of advisory service on financial and fiscal reporting of
public accounts; and (c) assessing fiduciary risks for project preparation and implementation
support recommending appropriate strengthening mitigating measures.
79.
The Bank is also planning to continue to support the Government in establishing
an enhanced and effective public procurement system and building better capacity of
its institutions. Both at the national and subnational levels, the Bank will provide just-intime policy advice and financial support to assist the Government in designing and
implementing key reforms in public procurement. These may include (a) the support to
implementation of a procurement strategy; (b) issuance and implementation of an improved
procurement law and regulations; (c) creation and support of a regulatory body in the context
of an inter-institutional coordination effort; (d) transformation and roll-out of the new eprocurement system (SECOP) that promotes transparency and competition in public
procurement; and (e) implementation of cost reduction strategies (price benchmarking,
consolidation for economies of scale). Furthermore, the Bank plans to provide technical
assistance to the Government to evaluate specific sectors and government programs to
uncover and deter public procurement deficiencies that may limit public services. The Bank
could also help to strengthen inter-institutional coordination and information-sharing systems
that will contribute to strengthening internal checks and balances.
80.
To address the challenges of low accountability and weak basis for managerial
decisions, the Strengthening Public Information, Monitoring and Evaluation for Results
Management Project has been helping the Government of Colombia to increase the use of
information for policy design and accountability in a cost-effective way. The project supports
the GOC SINERGIA program, which includes: (a) a system of monitoring indicators
throughout the public sector and linked to the national budget (SISMEG); (b) a system of
evaluation of public policies (SISDEVAL); and (c) a network of evaluation agencies
throughout Colombia (RED de Evaluación), which includes support to subnational
governments and therefore would be particularly attuned to the new Government‘s priority
for decentralization. The Bank will continue to provide technical support to the National
25

Planning Department in consolidating results-based public management and rigorous
evaluation of public programs and policies.
81.
The Bank also plans to provide analytical and advisory services to improve the
equity and efficiency of economic policies, by improving the quality and accessibility of
the evidence-base for decision-making. The main emphasis of this work is impact
evaluation and assessment of economic policies and programs that contribute to poverty
reduction, stronger labor markets, upward mobility, and gender. The Bank will continue
supporting GOC efforts to improve inputs and methodology for poverty measurement
through technical assistance for the MESEP and the new poverty committee and to improve
household income measurement. It will also provide support to analyze the impact of high
food prices on poverty through (a) a joint technical note with Department of National
Planning on the impact of food prices on poverty; and (b) an approved SFLAC recipientexecuted grant that will support the ability of Department of National Planning to monitor
the impact of food prices on poverty and evaluate its main determinants. The Bank will also
support GOC efforts to measure and track inequality and upward mobility, and to better
understand means to improve access to critical goods and services that can improve equity,
mobility, and the strengthening of the middle class. In particular, the Bank plans to undertake
the following activities: (a) Colombia Equity Assessment; (b) analytical work on Colombia
as part of the Regional Mobility Flagship; and (c) approval of a recipient-executed trust fund
for statistical capacity for the design on longitudinal surveys in Colombia (DNP/DANE).
Improved Productivity and Innovation
82.
The Government of Colombia seeks to strengthen productivity, innovation, and
entrepreneurship through increased coverage and better quality of financial and
education services, and stronger national systems for innovation and technology
transfer, with a special focus on improving productivity and innovation in small and
medium-size enterprises and the agricultural sector. The Government has also
emphasized its commitment to scale up investments in science, technology and innovation,
as reflected in the National Development Plan and the ―Plan Vive Digital‖.
83.
To support innovation, competitiveness, and entrepreneurship, the Bank will provide
a package of financial, knowledge, advisory, and convening services. The planned
Innovation, Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Investment Loan (FY13) will focus
on the following priorities: (a) strengthen the national system for innovation and technology
transfer; (b) strengthen financial mechanisms to support innovation (Bancoldex and Fondo
Emprender); (c) strengthen the intellectual property rights protection system; (d) strengthen
regional competitiveness; and (e) support technology transfer diffusion and other
mechanisms seeking to facilitate productivity improvements in small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs). This loan builds on the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI)
Program that is currently under implementation and enhances the competitiveness and
productivity of Colombian firms to foster sustainable growth and reduce economic
disparities. The Program links specific STI investments to promote knowledge generation
and absorption in Colombia to the national strategy for competitiveness and productivity and
to the development of priority industrial sectors in relation with the Productive
Transformation Strategy. Potential Bank knowledge and advisory services will broaden
26

support to include (a) reviewing the innovation system with focus on designing alternative
models for channeling resources toward regional innovation projects; (b) providing
international experiences on piloting projects to increase SME productivity and promote
technological transfer; and (c) conducting cluster/value chain analysis. The proposed Bank
support in this area will also focus on improving productivity of the service sector with
technical assistance on the design of a service sector survey focused on the informal sector
and analytical work on measurement of productivity in the service sector.
84.
The support for competitiveness and productivity growth are key features of the
IFC strategy for Colombia as well as for the entire Latin American and Caribbean
region. In addition to financing innovative companies and supporting efficiency gains, IFC
also expects to increase its financing for Colombian companies investing overseas, as well as
backing inward investment by companies based in developing countries. Outward investment
by Colombian businesses enables them to achieve economies of scale needed to compete in a
globalized marketplace, manage risk by reducing reliance on a single market, and increase
their exposure to international best practices.
85.
The Bank plans to improve firm productivity growth through knowledge and
advisory services to improve access to financial services. In particular this work will be
structured around (a) expanding the use of electronic money and mobile banking, (b)
supporting financial literacy, and (c) strengthening consumer protection. The IFC will
continue ramping up its SME financing by providing dedicated credit lines to client banks for
onlending to client companies. Although Colombia has made progress in strengthening its
business regulatory environment, investment climate obstacles remain. Colombia‘s business
entry and exit procedures are less efficient than those in industrialized countries and systems
for secured transactions and collateral registration can be improved. The WBG plans to
continue its technical assistance for improving the business regulatory environment,
including advising on the drafting of a new law for secured transactions and the creation of a
unified collateral registry. In addition, work will continue to simplify the areas of business
and property registration, and construction permits. The WBG has three investment climate
operations in Colombia at present.
86.
The Government has also requested the WBG to implement in 2012 the third Doing
Business subnational study in collaboration of the Department of National Planning. The
project goal is to promote competition for a better business environment in Colombia by
benchmarking business regulations across Colombian cities and comparing them with 183
economies.
87.
The IFC has also developed a vibrant microfinance industry in Colombia both
through investments and advisory engagements. Microfinance is an important part of IFC‘s
financial markets strategy in Colombia for its impact on low-income communities, women,
and minorities. The IFC hopes to support the expansion of mobile banking services in
Colombia. It also hopes to help provide insurance coverage for low-income groups through
investments in second-tier insurance companies. The IFC microfinance portfolio consists of
seven projects totaling US$40.9 million, which accounts for 10 percent of its financial
markets portfolio in Colombia. The IFC advisory services also hopes to increase its
engagement with the microfinance sector, assisting lenders to transition from NGO status to
becoming regulated financial institutions. The IFC objectives for the microfinance sector in
Colombia include: (a) increasing access to finance through programs aimed at micro, small
27

and medium-size enterprise; low- and middle-income segments; rural populations; women;
and the underserved; (b) lowering intermediation costs through improved risk management
and greater operating efficiencies; (c) deepening, broadening and diversifying financial
sector participation to achieve greater financial sector stability; and (d) targeting programs in
insurance and low-income housing.
88.
The Bank is also likely to play an important role in the area of infrastructure for
growth and competitiveness during the CPS period. An initial activity, which emerged
from the policy notes undertaken during the political transition period, has been launched to
provide technical assistance in the redesign of the National Institute of Concessions, and the
development of a new concessions entity. It is likely that this work will be complemented in
the near future with further knowledge and convening activities, in conjunction with the IFC,
related to the institutional and legal issues related to public–private partnerships in the
infrastructure sectors. The IFC has worked successfully with the Government on structuring
a PPP concession for the 1,071-kilometer highway, Ruta del Sol, and expects that close
engagement with the authorities will lead to more PPP-related activities at national and
departmental levels.
89.
Like infrastructure, another of the GOC “engines of growths” is mining and
extractive industries. The Bank is now working with the Ministry of Mines and Energy
through technical assistance activities related to improving the management of mining
concessions information, including the social land environmental aspects of extractive
industries. Given the expected continued importance of extractive industry growth in
Colombia, it is likely that this will remain an important area in which the WBG maintains an
engagement. As mentioned above, IFC advisory services expect to expand its royalty
management program in Colombia to assist communities to better manage revenue from
local mining operations.
90.
The World Bank is also focusing on improving competitiveness and productivity
of the agriculture sector. With Bank support in 2002, the Government started a small pilot
program called Rural Productive Partnership, which increases rural competitiveness and
builds up rural entrepreneurship in a sustainable manner. The program supports demanddriven partnerships between organized small producers and the commercial private sector
with the objective to improve small producers‘ incomes through their participation in highvalue chains. To date, the program has supported 213 partnerships. The Government intends
to scale up the program by adding 640 new partnerships by the end of 2014. The Bank is
planning to help the Government to scale up this program under the title Small-holder
Agriculture Competitiveness. The scaling up is likely to include linkages to other key
policy programs in the areas of land restitution, agricultural innovations, as well as
agricultural risk mitigation and risk management, as needed to improve the competitiveness
of small-holder agriculture. The Agricultural Transition Project, currently under
implementation, aims to strengthen the national agricultural science and technology and
sanitary and phytosanitary systems by supporting joint participation of the public and private
sectors through production chain mechanisms, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of
Colombian agriculture and improving the accessibility of export-potential products to
international markets. Land management and administration might also be an area in which
the Bank could work under this CPS. The IFC may also engage with selected agribusiness

28

clients to raise yields and productivity through investment projects, advisory engagements, or
a combination of both.
The Agricultural Transition Project is appropriately complemented by the Science,
Technology, and Innovation Project. The Bank builds on the well-established cooperation
with the Government of Colombia in the STI and tertiary education sectors. The project‘s
main objective is to increase access, quality, and coherence in the tertiary education
subsector. Colciencias (Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación)
was a co-implementing agency for this loan, which financed national doctoral scholarships,
the acquisition of robust research equipment, and researchers‘ mobility programs. The
project enhances the competitiveness and productivity of Colombian firms to foster
sustainable growth and reduce economic disparities. The project links specific STI
investments to promote knowledge generation and absorption to the national strategy for
competitiveness and productivity and to development of priority industrial sectors under the
Productive Transformation Strategy.
91.

C. The WBG’s Indicative Program
92.
In terms of financial services, the Government has indicated financing expectations of
about US$1.1 billion in FY12. The FY11 financing program was lower than in recent years
as a result of the Presidential transition period. For FY13-16 the lending program is expected
to be US$800–1,080 million per annum. These are only indicative lending amounts. Actual
delivery of the lending program will depend on Colombia‘s performance, IBRD lending
capacity, demand from other borrowers, global economic developments, and disbursement
profiles that keep exposure within the country limits.
93.
Trust funds will continue to be an integral part of the Bank‘s engagement with
Colombia. As trust fund resources are not predictable for the purpose of the CPS, the WBG
will ensure that activities financed by trust funds follow the thrust of this strategy in
agreement with the Government counterparts.
94.
The CPS thematic areas will be managed under an enhanced thematic business model
approach. This approach aims to improve the impact of the Bank‘s engagement in Colombia.
Financial, knowledge, and convening services are managed as a comprehensive package of
support under each theme to deliver timely and flexible development solutions.
95.
The WBG intends to monitor CPS results via (a) regular project/program supervision;
(b) annual reviews of programmatic knowledge and convening services; (c) annual Country
Portfolio Performance Reviews; (d) client demand and feedback, in particular with respect to
knowledge and convening services; (e) Bank internal independent evaluations; and (f) the
mid-term CPS Progress Report.

D. Development Partner Collaboration and South-South Knowledge Exchange
96.
Joint work with other development partners, both the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) and Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), has entailed inter-disciplinary
activities from conditional cash transfer (CCT) experiences to the harmonization of
procedures for the STI project; energy-generation deals with IFC; and collaboration for
completion of the NUTP system. Other bilateral donors have worked closely with the Bank
providing grant funds for programs that are ranging from youth promotion, gender equality,
and institutional strengthening to flood management and public transport.

30

97.
South-South Cooperation (SSC) is an important national priority for Colombia.
Colombia‘s National Development Plan identifies international relevance through SouthSouth Cooperation as a key cross-cutting theme, and the Government has striven to
strengthen the planning, funding, and implementation of South-South Knowledge Exchange
(SSKE) while promoting Colombia as a potential SSKE partner regionally and globally.
Colombia and Indonesia co-chair the Task Team on South-South Cooperation, a working
party of the OECD/DAC and an international coalition of countries, multilaterals, donors,
academic institutions, and other stakeholders that aim to develop good practice and policy
guidance for SSC activities. The World Bank Country Team is looking to include an SSKE
component in its capacity development initiatives in Colombia and is promoting Colombia‘s
participation in a WBI Pilot Brokering Mechanism supporting SSKE. The pilot aims to help
countries document their knowledge-sharing needs and facilitate matches for exchanges
between developing country partners. (Annex F provides further details regarding
Colombia‘s role in SSKE and the Pilot Brokering Mechanism.)
98.
In addition, the Accra Agenda for Action created a mandate to review the SSKE and
Triangular Cooperation. Colombia is the leader of this new initiative as a long-standing SSC
practitioner. The public mass transit system in Bogotá (Transmilenio), which has been
replicated in many countries, is a good example of technical cooperation and mutual learning
and its contribution to development.

V. RISKS
99.
Colombia is vulnerable to commodity price shocks and a deterioration of
external financing conditions. Commodity exports accounted for 63 percent of export
revenue in 2010 while 73 percent of foreign direct investment inflows are in commodityrelated projects (mainly oil). As a result, an adverse shock to oil and other primary exports
(e.g., coffee) could result in a significant increase in Colombia‘s financing needs. A sudden
deterioration of external financing conditions would also affect Colombia. Tighter global
financial conditions would lower the inflows of private capital envisaged in the
macroeconomic projections; and public external financing conditions also could be affected,
even if the Government was to maintain access to international markets at favorable rates,
possibly creating debt roll-over difficulties. The two-year US$6.2 billion (SDR3.87 billion)
arrangement under the IMF Flexible Credit Line, approved in May 2011, will mitigate these
risks continuing to provide space for policy flexibility while bolstering Colombia‘s access to
international markets if tail risks were to materialize.
100. Another external economic risk derives from a slower-than-expected global
recovery. Earlier fears of a double-dip recession have not materialized, but there are
important downside risks. Future developments in the United States, in particular, are of
importance to Colombia. Substantially higher oil prices or a further decline in domestic
housing prices could dampen confidence and consumer spending in the United States. This
would reduce demand for Colombian exports. Higher global prices for Colombia‘s
commodity exports will mitigate this impact, but the recovery of non-traditional exports
(e.g., flowers) may be slower than expected. The Bank and the IMF are maintaining an on-

31

going policy dialogue with the Government on macroeconomic policy issues, which may
help detect early potential threats to Colombia‘s growth.
101. Rising food prices. Since end-2010, global food prices have risen substantially and
are now at levels comparable to the 2008 crisis with a risk that they may rise even further
owing to global market conditions. High food prices raise macroeconomic as well as social
concerns. Higher global prices are, to some extent, transmitted to domestic food prices,
which in turn generate inflation. If the Central Bank evaluates that the price effect is
permanent or that it affects expectations for inflation, then it may decide to tighten monetary
policy, which would dampen the economic recovery. Higher food prices directly affect
poverty given that a relatively higher share of household consumption is devoted to food
expenses among the poor. The Government of Colombia can mitigate this impact through
social programs, including an increase in the amount of conditional cash transfer.
102. Policy slippages in implementing fiscal reforms. Given the high level of ambition
for the fiscal reform agenda, there is a risk of slower progress in politically contentious areas.
This unfortunately has been frequently the case in Colombia when dealing with structural
fiscal reforms in the past (e.g., pensions, health care). This would call for frontloaded action
in key policy reform areas that signal commitment to strengthening fiscal institutions and
reducing fiscal risks. Moving forward with the most contentious issues first would signal
strong commitment to reform and mitigate some of these risks. The Government has, to some
extent, followed this strategy, for instance, by bringing forward the royalties reform and
frontloading the fiscal adjustment. The Bank will stay engaged through its programmatic and
comprehensive engagement in the fiscal reform program.
103. Sustainability of reform efforts in disaster risk management. In the aftermath of
the La Niña event, natural disaster risk management moved to the top on the political agenda.
The Government designed an effective post-disaster financing mechanism; included the
theme in the new National Development Plan; and between December 7, 2010 and January 6,
2011, the issued several decrees to improve the country‘s future crises preparedness. While
there are important indications that Colombia is heading toward an improved institutional
framework, there is a risk that reform attention will be diverted as the memory of the recent
disaster fades and other priorities rise up the political agenda. The Government has asked the
Bank to be its strategic partner in moving the reforms forward, and the Bank can try to
mitigate the risk by reminding the Government of importance of the agenda.
104. Working at subnational level. As the Bank intensifies its engagement at the
subnational level, fiduciary and safeguard risks will increase — as will the costs of attendant
mitigation mechanisms. The Bank may also face potential reputational risks as it expands its
support into regions where local governments might be subject to the influence of illegal
groups and other non-state actors. The Central Government‘s commitment to work with the
subnational authorities and the Bank to embed strong fiduciary measures will help offset
these potential risks.
105. Promoting peace, deposing violence. Peace has not been secured throughout the
entire country. Poverty, corruption, and the drug trade remain significant challenges. A rise
in urban crime and violence from illegal groups tied to the drug trade — some of which have
been formed by former paramilitary combatants — represents an increasing security
challenge and will require more attention from the Government during 2011–16.
32

Strengthened drug cartels in Mexico and Central America working closely with Colombian
suppliers also impose a challenge for the authorities in the years to come. Beginning in early
2000, the Bank has been closely involved with the Government in a range of activities
related to community-driven conflict resolution and management as part of the peace pillar in
the previous CPS. These activities are likely to continue in coming years as the new
administration has broadly adopted policies to further promote peace.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) assesses the joint IBRD/IFC CPS
for Colombia (FY2008-11). It describes the support provided through an integrated package of financial,
knowledge, and coordination services; evaluates (i) the achievements of CPS program outcomes; (ii)
assesses World Bank Group (WBG) performance; and (iii) draws lessons for the preparation of the
forthcoming CPS (FY2012-16). The March 1, 2010 CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) adjusted the original
CPS program and strengthened its CPS Results Matrix. This CPSCR uses the updated CPSPR Results
Matrix as the reference for assessing CPS program performance.
A. Colombia’s Economic and Social Background
1. During preparation of the CPS (2008-11), Colombia was enjoying a period of high economic
growth (an average of five percent per annum for CY07 and CY08), growing consumption,
accelerating investment, and rising confidence. This was due to a propitious external
environment, improving internal security, access to new geographical areas and markets,
expanding credit, and a natural resources boom. The improved economic conditions resulted in
rising incomes, a reduction in poverty, and greater social sector coverage. But the international
economic crisis 2008 brought a halt to the high growth period, and the near-future prospects were
clouded by uncertainties concerning policy continuity and the need to tackle structural obstacles
to increase long-term growth.
2. The Government faced daunting and simultaneous challenges to achieve sustained peace,
security, and economic stability. As a result of successful demobilization negotiations, the
Government had to reintegrate thousands of former combatants into civilian life and provide them
with sufficient incentives not to re-arm or re-engage in illegal activities. The guerrilla and
paramilitary activities and the narco-trafficking have continued to pose obstacles to achieving
sustainable development in Colombia.
3. The country‘s comprehensive social protection system limited the impact of the crisis on poorest
families. During the crisis, the Government effectively shielded social protection expenditures
from broader cuts, and expanded programs targeted to the poor, such as Familias en Acción, the
core conditional cash transfer program, and Juntos, the Government‘s strategy to provide social
work assistance to the poorest families. While challenges remain in terms of coverage and
efficiency of the social protection system, the existing programs preserved a minimum level of
benefits, contained the negative impact of the crisis on poorer households and shielded them from
the downward adjustments that often result in losses of human, physical, and financial assets.

B. World Bank Program of Support
4. The current CPS, discussed by the Executive Board in April 2008, was prepared after a new
political administration in Colombia came into office. The structure of the CPS was aligned with
the priorities identified in the new National Development Plan for 2006-2010 with a proposed
IBRD engagement of a base lending of around US$4 billion (for the FY08-11) with an
increasingly active IFC program. This was complemented by knowledge and
coordination/convening services as well as specialized grants. The CPS was designed to be
flexible and innovative in response to Colombia‘s financial and development needs. In keeping
with past practice, the CPS allowed for innovative instruments in response to program needs. It
also called for increased coordination within the Bank Group and with other development
partners.

46

5. The implementation of the strategy has proceeded for the most part along the lines established in
the original CPS. Most of the proposed activities outlined in the CPS were carried out, but
adjustments were made to respond to unexpected developments (see Annex B). The ensuing
international economic crisis in particular affected the financing needs of the Government, as well
as their requirements for knowledge and coordination services.

II. CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
6. Overall the CPS program performance is rated satisfactory as the program achieved good
progress toward all major expected outcomes.
7. The IBRD lending program proceeded faster than anticipated to the economic crisis in Colombia.
During the CPS period, the Executive Board has approved 20 loans to Colombia amounting to
US$3,703 million. In addition, during this same period, the Bank delivered an average of six
analytical and advisory activities (SAP count) per fiscal year, ranging in topics from climate
change, education quality, decentralization, financial sector access, poverty measurement (Human
Opportunity Index), social protection, health system modernization and extractive industries.
Disbursements for the CPS period have been around US$3.9 billion (average of US$975 million
per FY), while overall exposure to Colombia rose to approximately US$7.5 billion. The Bank‘s
response to the crisis has led to an acceleration of disbursements in the last couple years, not only
because of fast-disbursing, policy-based loans but also because a few investment operations had a
front-loaded disbursements profile. As a result, IBRD lending to Colombia increased from
US$940 million in FY08 to US$1,275 in FY09, dropping to US$1,173 million in FY10 and
projected at US$315 million in FY11. During the CPS period, the Bank had also around 27 grants
from different trust funds totaling over US$60 million under implementation.
A. Overview and Principles of Engagement
8. The Bank followed three basic principles of engagement in developing its relationship with
Colombia: flexibility, responsiveness and innovation. The flexibility granted by the CPS proved
to be extremely perceptive. In the initial stages of the CPS, when the currency was strengthening
and foreign capital flows were strong, Colombian authorities were focused on the innovative
instruments available from the Bank and were particularly interested in domestic currency
financing, as well as a mix of investment and development policy lending. More recently, the
authorities have asked for support in dealing with the adverse consequences of the global crisis.
This includes additional financing and technical assistance to help sustain and improve crucial
government programs to attenuate the effects of the crisis.
9. To support the emerging needs of the private sector, the IFC also adapted its Colombia strategy
and diversified its portfolio with new projects in infrastructure logistics, microfinance, higher
education, vocational training, agribusiness, natural resources (oil, gas, and mining), and energy
efficiency. The IFC response also led to an increase in commitments and disbursements. The IFC
committed portfolio almost doubled from US$504 million in FY06 to US$881 million in FY10,
as a result of financing 27 projects during this period (in agribusiness, the financial sector,
manufacturing, infrastructure, extractive industries, and private equity fund) for a total
commitment of US$846 million, including syndications. These results were in great part due t
the IFC decentralization process. Today, the Bogotá regional hub office has 30 staff, a three-fold
increase from 2006.
10. In keeping with the principles of engagement, the World Bank Group has also provided an array
of knowledge and convening services to Colombia, ranging from technical support embedded in
the preparation of projects to analytical work specific for Colombia, along with both regional and

47

global studies, just-in-time technical assistance specifically tailored for particular requests, policy
dialogue, and transfer of global knowledge. One important and innovative aspect of this work was
its multi-year programmatic approach, where IBRD had an on-going engagement in key areas,
and defined its annual work program according to the existing needs at the time. The IFC
advisory program expanded in Colombia, and its services were also based on a programmatic
approach that supported strategic investments, with an emphasis on sustainable business advisory
projects, investment climate work, and access to finance engagements. In August 2010, after
elections, the Bank Group team prepared a set of thematic policy notes and met with the President
Santos and Government officials to discuss potential priority areas and provide early input into
the new National Development Plan.
11. Financial innovation was a hallmark characteristic of the Bank Group‘s program. Colombia has
always made effective use of the new Bank instruments, and in some instances has promoted and
led the innovation. During the CPS period, Colombia was one of the first countries to make use
of the new contingent financing for natural catastrophes under the revised Deferred Drawdown
Option (DDO) guidelines. Over the past few years, the Bank‘s Treasury Department has advised
Colombia on several issues related to risk and debt management, including contingent liabilities.
12. The Bank has advised Colombian authorities on strengthening of the Investor Relations Office,
leveraging the Bank‘s expertise in accessing international markets and developing outreach
materials. Complimentarily, the Bank continued providing local currency financing to subnational entities such as Cartagena, Antioquia, and Bogotá by converting outstanding loan
amounts to pesos.

B. Progress by Strategic Engagement Themes (Towards CPS Outcomes)
13. The CPS Outcomes, Status and Evaluation Summary, and IBRD/IFC interventions that
contributed to the CPS outcomes are summarized in the CPS Completion Report Matrix in Annex
A.
B 1. Sustained Equitable Growth
14. Commendable macroeconomic management, improvements on institutions, and strengthening
of the financial markets brought about economic growth and increase in competitiveness.
Human capital growth was improved through enhanced quality of secondary and tertiary
education programs.
15. The work under this theme became crucial for the Bank‘s engagement following the onset of the
economic crisis. The WBG contributed to preserving economic growth and minimizing the
impact of the crisis in Colombia through policy-based and IFC loans, as well as targeted
interventions and provision of knowledge and coordination/convening services.
16. The focus of the work was on the economy‘s competitiveness, the financial system, capital
markets, infrastructure development and human capital. Among several loans, the most important
were some development policy loans that supported important policy reforms in the areas of
business efficiency and competitiveness, along with the reforms in the financial sector. The Bank
supported implementation measures that helped keep the banking system adequacy ratio above 10
percent. These policy-based loans also served to cover the fiscal needs during the crisis and to
preserve macroeconomic stability. This was accompanied by project lending in infrastructure.
17. In the area of competitiveness, lending was buttressed by substantial technical assistance.
Development policy lending on business productivity was the umbrella for the program and was
part of a programmatic series that supported reforms in the areas of innovation and technology,
quality standards, and private sector participation in infrastructure and logistics. The Bank also

48

supported labor market reforms through a multi-year knowledge service program that was the
main input in the design of new policies to reduce informality and make the labor markets more
efficient and flexible. A significant contribution was the assistance provided to the National
Planning Department through studies and seminars in their formulation of policies for
employment and income generation.
18. In the area of financial sector development, the Bank provided development policy lending on
finance and private sector development, which supported the recent legal reforms designed to
strengthen financial sector resiliency and deepen capital markets. This was accompanied by
knowledge services to improve the framework for consolidated supervision and to regulate overthe-counter markets (i.e., advisory work on accounting and financial reporting standards and
strengthening social accountability). The Bank also helped Colombian authorities to undertake a
financial crisis simulation exercise. Through the FIRST program, Colombia received Bank
support to correct any identified shortcomings.
19. The IFC also made investments in key financial lending institutions in order to develop new
services. Since access to finance is low in Colombia, particularly in the rural areas, the joint
Bank/IFC work in financial sector reforms greatly facilitated the IFC investment program to
reach the underserved. With significant involvement in Colombia‘s microfinance sector, IFC
investments in 6 lenders enabled them to make almost 1 million loans for a total US$1.13 billion
in CY2009, equivalent to about one-quarter of all loans by the IFC‘s Latin American
microfinance lenders that year. Bancamia is a key IFC microfinance partner in Colombia and the
country‘s third microfinance lender. The IFC invested US$10 million for a minority equity stake
in the Bancamia in May 2010. In CY2009, Bancamia made over 300,000 loans for a total
US$238.6 million, or an average of about US$800 per loan. Two-thirds of its clients are lowincome women living across 300 municipalities around Colombia.
20. The IFC has also played a role in strengthening Colombia‘s conventional banking system through
countercyclical investments. In May 2010, for instance, IFC committed US$23.5 million in equity
and subordinated debt to finance acquisition of non-performing loans first originated by
Bancolombia, the country‘s biggest bank. This transaction, signed in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis, allowed a systemically important bank to dispose of its non-performing assets
through a market-based mechanism. In addition to financing, IFC also provided a package of
corporate governance advice and workout guidelines that set an example of distressed asset
resolution. The IFC has been active in the global non-performing loan (NPL) market for over a
decade and was able to use its expertise to benefit Bancolombia and assist in the development of
an active NPL market in Colombia.
21. The IFC and IBRD also closely coordinated their support to concentrate much of the project
financing to improve the infrastructure in the country, particularly in areas of transport and basic
services. This was complemented by investments to improve water and sanitation services, solid
waste management, urban housing development, as well as renewable energy and energy
efficiency. The Bank also supported the development of the urban mass transit program in six
major cities, recognized as one of the most innovative and pioneering projects in LCR. This has
been accompanied by assistance to improve urban services in Bogotá, including preliminary
studies on the viability of a metro system. Through a programmatic approach, IFC invested in
transportation/logistic projects (roads, airlines, and ports) and leveraged its investments with
Advisory Services on trade logistics and competitiveness. This approach is exemplified by IFC‘s
role in one of Latin America‘s most significant road projects. Ruta del Sol, a 1,000-kilometer
highway linking Bogotá to the Caribbean coast. The IFC‘s Infrastructure Advisory Team acted as
transaction adviser to Colombia‘s Transportation Ministry, assisting it in structuring and
implementing a public/private partnership project for the concession of the highway. Colombia
has achieved considerable success in attracting local contractors to other public–private projects,

49

but the Government felt IFC would be crucial in convincing large international groups to bid for
such a large and complex project. The IFC completed the three-year concession process in
August 2010. Contracts worth US$2.7 billion were awarded to companies from Argentina, Brazil,
and Italy, as well as Colombia. In addition to reducing travel time between Colombia‘s biggest
cities and the coast, Ruta del Sol will also improve access for once-isolated rural communities.
22. One of IFC‘s largest exposures in Colombia is to Avianca, the national flagship airline. The IFC
committed US$50 million in loans to the airline in September 2008 as part of a turnaround
program being implemented by the troubled carrier‘s new owners. Avianca is an integral part of
Colombia‘s transport system given the country‘s mountainous terrain and long distances between
cities. The company was later able to merge with El Salvador‘s TACA, improving connections
between Central America and the Andean region.

B.2. Poverty Alleviation and Equity of Opportunity
23. The Bank contributed to expanded coverage and quality of public services and social
protection targeted to poor. Increased equality in the Colombian society and opportunities for
the less fortunate especially during the period of the financial crisis mark a significant
development in the fight against poverty including an expanded coverage and quality of public
services. Support ranged from reforms in the health sector to improving the quality of
education; promoting science, technology and innovation; and strengthening the social
protection system.
24. Significantly triggered by the onset of the crisis, the core of the support was through a loan to
preserve the financing of the country‘s main social welfare program, Familias en Acción, a
conditional cash transfer program. Among the Government initiatives in terms of providing social
assistance and poverty alleviation is the creation of Red Juntos, which aims to reduce extreme
poverty by providing extremely poor families with accompaniment and preferential access to core
social services. The Bank‘s support to these programs includes continued knowledge services to
help improve the protection under the social security system, rationalize the existing complex set
of overlapping programs, and modernize the system of information and evaluation.
25. The work in this area was based on the principle of increasing the equality of opportunities by
expanding the provision of basic services. As such, during the current CPS several loans were
extended to expand services in key areas such as water and sanitation, and agricultural and rural
development. In the area of agriculture and rural development, the program included the support
to small farmer organizations to increase market access for their products, and foster a sense of
entrepreneurship. The program also included support for agricultural research and development as
well as the strengthening of sanitary and phytosanitary systems along with the first public, highlevel bio-safety laboratory in the country. The IFC‘s US$30 million financing for Abocol helped
improve agribusiness competitiveness by supporting the fertilizer sector.
26. The Bank Group‘s support in this area also included substantial analytical and advisory service
(i.e. publications on agricultural sectoral issues.)
27. The program also included several projects in education, mostly in the rural areas, and focused on
secondary school quality and enrollment. A core element was support to the student loan program
geared toward giving access to secondary school education to indigenous people. As for the
IBRD Antioquia Secondary Education project, completion rate in the poorest areas has
dramatically increased. The IFC complemented the education initiatives by investing in
Uniminuto, a higher-education institution that serves mostly students from lower quintiles of the
population. Uniminuto aims to reach a total enrollment of 44,000 students by 2015, half of which
will be women. In CY2009, the school had 26,000 students of whom 60 percent were women.

50

Uniminuto is focused on serving the lower two quintiles of Colombian society. Many of its
students are from secondary cities, peri-urban, or rural areas.
28. A key area of involvement was the support to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the
Colombian health system. The complexity of the financing and delivery systems, with cross
subsidies and different forms of reimbursements, and coupled with a Constitutional Court ruling
that guarantees the fundamental right to health, firmly established the need for regulatory reform
to guarantee equal access to all citizens and a fundamental review and reform of the health sector.
29. The Bank played a key coordination and supportive role in the updating of poverty measures.
This work entailed naming a high-level Presidential Commission to assist the Government in
updating its poverty measurements. The lack of consistent information and the publication of
recent poverty data created significant doubts about the accuracy of the preliminary figures. The
work of the Bank and the Commission helped give credibility to the poverty figures.
30. Several grants focused on gender issues and on strengthening institutions dealing with
discrimination. The Bank, with financing from the Japanese Social Development Fund, helped
improve the skills of mostly young single mothers, who have been displaced by the violence in
the country, to assist them to integrate in the formal economy. Another grant supported the
Presidential Secretary for Gender to institute a system of certification of businesses that promote
gender equality and are apply gender-free policies.
B 3. Environment and Natural Resource Management
31. The considerable increase in design and implementation of knowledge and lending services in
sustainable development dramatically increased awareness on environmental issues. The
World Bank Group was able to provide input to national policy and help the Government to
strengthen institutional capacity for managing environmental services and mainstreaming
principles of environmental sustainability.
32. The environmental sustainability activities ranged from loans to support policy reforms and
implementation, to grants designed for piloting key protection and adaptation programs. This was
complemented by many investment projects in flood protection, water treatment, and disaster risk
management. A significant part of the program dealt with climate change adaptation programs.
33. One of the first actions under the CPS was to provide financing and technical support for the
implementation of important policy reforms. The work in this area involved updating the
environmental health policies of the country, where new emission standards were applied. It also
included updating the institutional structure to deal with the formulation and implementation of
environmental policies.
34. Under the CPS, there were several investment projects that contributed to environmental
sustainability, including lending activities in water and sanitation and solid waste management.
These activities are being complemented by two projects under supervision for disaster risk
management, which are designed to improve the data gathering and analysis framework, along
with reinforcing school and hospital buildings. The Government also entered into a catastrophic
risk deferred drawdown option (CAT DDO), the new financial instrument that provides
contingency financing in case of a major natural disaster.
35. The GEF supported a variety of activities, including conservation of national protected areas, and
multi-country integrated Silvopastoral approaches to ecosystem management, an example of
recent achievements under the National Protected Areas GEF with sustainable natural resource
practices in place. Several other grants supported pilot programs of renewable energy, efficiency,
and greenhouse gas reductions in the transport sector. Colombia has also made effective use of
carbon finance grants.

51

36. The IFC invested selectively in small hydro-generation in remote areas of Colombia and in
thermal efficiency, consistent with its focus on reducing impact on climate change through
renewal energy and cleaner, more efficient electricity generation. The IFC was instrumental in
upgrading and expanding the Termoflores natural gas-fired electricity-generating plant in
Barranquilla through a US$62.5 million loan package that included US$10 million in
syndications. The project used energy efficiency gains and heat recovery to increase output
without a significant increase in gas consumption.
B 4. Peace and Development
37. The Bank played an important role in supporting the country’s efforts to achieve lasting peace
and inclusive development. The Bank’s interventions contributed to improved effectiveness of
Government’s peace initiatives by increasing awareness of global experience and piloting
innovative models of participatory community development in conflict-affected zones.
Colombia‘s recent history has been marred by violence and armed conflicts that have precluded
the country from achieving its full development potential. Violence has also displaced a large
portion of the population. The Bank actively supported the joint efforts by the Government and
the international community with both financing and coordination services.
38. As an innovative approach to the gender, minority populations, and youth issues, the Bank
integrated grant activities to the Peace and Development pillar. The Internally Displaced
Women‘s Project was designed to increase the economic empowerment of women in
communities of internally displaced populations by assisting them in joining the formal labor
force, building their assets (including greater food security), and helping them to understand the
causes of political and/or domestic violence against women and develop tools to mitigate them.
The Bank closely engaged in supporting the Secretary for Women‘s Issues in the Presidency with
an initiative to certify those businesses and enterprises that adopted gender-neutral employment
policies. The Human Rights Project‘s was designed to identify effective links between the nature
and work of the Regional Peace and Development Programs, Government, other partners and the
Bank, regarding human rights and to promote the introduction of human rights best practices in
peace and development interventions. The new operations, Afropaz, designed to strengthen AfroColombian organizations, build social networks and empower communities to promote local
development, and Access to Opportunities for Youth, designed to enhance the access of young
men and women to opportunities for education, work and political participation, were recently
declared effective.
39. As part of the activities under this pillar, the Bank was a key player in the coordination of
activities of the international community. The Bank led organizing and preparing the
International Disarmament, Demobilization and Reparation Congress in Cartagena in May of
2009. This Congress and the Education for Peace Partnership are examples of the catalytic role
the Bank plays in promoting dialogue and disseminating experiences.
40. Joint efforts with the International Organization for Migration, the Bank contributed to
diminishing the risk of impoverishment of the displaced population and to the peace-building
process, by promoting the application of measures for protection of patrimonial assets, providing
land titles for those internally displaced populations whose rights have not been protected, and
proposing public policy initiatives for restitution of properties of internally displaced populations.
Under the two initial phases, more than 3 million hectares have been protected, equivalent to
100,000 farms and 127,000 land rights, benefiting overall more than 95,000 individuals. A third
phase was declared effective in August 2010, and project outcomes have been acknowledged and
recognized by the new Government to the extent that the project will constitute the foundation of
the land restitution and regularization flagship program of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development that will benefit 480,000 displaced and violence-affected families.

52

41. The Bank raised the awareness of the human challenges confronted by Colombians affected by
violence through a unique publication, ―Voices.‖ The book, published in June 2009, contains
stories of the experiences of individuals directly touched by the violence. A special exhibit, which
included a collection of photographs and testimonials, was mounted in several Colombian cities
and in Washington D.C.
B 5. A State at the Service of its Citizens: Efficient and Effective Government
42. Excellent public financial management paired with an increase in the number of social
programs contributes to Central Government efforts to improve public sector management and
citizen services. The Bank’s supported programs improved public sector management and
citizen services in support of Central Government efforts.
43. The World Bank Group‘s expanded its support for institutional reforms and improvement in
governance. Initiatives ranged from strengthening the public management information systems to
integrating the tax and customs administration processes, implementing a system of monitoring
and evaluation of government programs, expanding the assistance to sub-national governments,
and assisting with the modernization of the judicial sector. One of the major achievements was
the introduction of a new system for budget management throughout the Central Government. It
is a web-based system, with open architecture, which will greatly improve the efficiency of public
financial management, expand access to information, and establish greater transparency. The
new system is being complemented with new norms and procedures for budgetary management,
as well as the introduction of a single account for cash management.
44. The support for improving the managerial systems was designed for the full application of
country systems. The Bank accepted the use of Colombia‘s financial management system for its
projects and programs. This was achieved with considerable support by several project loans that
helped modernize the systems, and the progress achieved in streamlining implementation
arrangements and the reliance on the Colombian Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) and subnational SAIs for external audits for Bank-financed projects. The Bank provided extensive
training and technical assistance to the SAI toward strengthening its staff capacity; and from
2008, all projects with the exception of grants implemented by NGOs are audited by the SAI.
45. A Public Financial Management (PFM) and Procurement Performance Assessment Report, which
was authorized by the Government, concluded that PFM systems, institutions, and processes at
the central level show advanced levels of performance, which are close to or follow good
international practice. There remain a few gaps where challenges and opportunities to further
enhance PFM in the country could be pursued in the near future toward strengthening fiscal
discipline and increasing operational efficiency and transparency.
46. The program under this theme included targeted financing and a broad program of knowledge
services. During the last two years, several smaller loans were approved to improve the services
of the state. They included a loan to support building the Management and Planning System for
the Government (SIGOB), a fairly advanced system of monitoring and evaluation of government
programs, which is considered a leading program in Latin America. This technical assistance
loan is assisting with all of the evaluations of government programs being carried out by the
National Planning Department. The Board has approved a follow-up loan for the Modernization
of the Public Sector Management Systems. This operation is part of a series of loans that, over the
years, helped modernize the budget and financial systems, along with the tax and customs
agencies. The other important operation will be assisting with the process of judicial sector
reforms, which remain a major development challenge for the country.
47. Among the most promising work was the development of new relationships and support for subnational governments. The public sector group has developed a new product called the Rapid
Assessment and Action Plan (RAAP) for sub-national governments. Public sector experts on

53

fiscal, budget, tax, financial management and information systems worked with local authorities
to develop an action plan for key public sector reforms. The first two studies were presented in
cities where there has been tremendous improvement in the financial, fiscal, and managerial
capacities. The IFC complemented this work with cities and regions on issues of regional
competitiveness, local business climate, and management of royalties from mining development.
The IFC‘s Advisory Services expects to expand its royalty management activities in Colombia,
assisting companies and local communities in managing revenues from mining and oil producing
projects. The IFC currently advises Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company and is in advanced
talks with other clients on future engagements.
III. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
48. The World Bank Group performance is rated satisfactory. The CPS was relevant, aligned with
the Government’s National Development Plan and its design and implementation of the
program contributed to the achievement of CPS outcomes with a focus on results, and a timely
adaptation to changing circumstances and priorities. It delivered a package of services beyond
those initially anticipated in the CPS, in response to both the emerging needs of the country and
the impact of the international financial crisis.
49. The success of the strategy and program was due in part to the continued Bank presence over the
years, the close engagement with the client, WBG‘s responsiveness and an active supervision and
follow-up to the projects and scheduled activities.
A. CPS Design
50. The foresight to preserve the flexibility and to ensure full compatibility with the Government‘s
program proved critical. In addition, the design of the strategy was constructed on the basis of
extensive experience and understanding of the conditions and the development challenges of
Colombia. The initial CPS results framework entailed a mixture of outcomes and outputs and
was therefore strengthened and updated in the CPSPR.
51. The success of the Bank‘s program in Colombia owes much to the fact that the CPS was well
aligned with the priorities of the Government, and thus equipped with strong local ownership.
The strategic engagement areas of the CPS were fully consistent with the main building blocks of
the National Development Plan.
52. The Bank‘s ability to respond successfully to the changing circumstances in Colombia was rooted
in the flexibility of the CPS design. The Bank was able to adjust its program or reallocate staff
and budgetary resources in response to the country‘s emerging financial and development needs,
especially at a time when international markets were severely constrained. Colombia continues to
promote innovation by taking full advantage of the new instruments and policies offered by the
World Bank.
B. Implementing the Strategy
53. The overall implementation of the strategy was satisfactory. The Bank followed essentially the
overall thrust of the CPS, while having to make adjustments in response to the international
financial crisis. The initial program had to be altered slightly to include accelerated
disbursements through policy-based loans and projects supporting budget programs. Most of the
potential investment projects initially identified in the CPS were carried out, and some new
priorities were introduced as a result of continued dialogue with the authorities.
54. As shown in the Results Matrix (Annex A), most of the activities of the WBG involved transfer
of knowledge and provision of advisory and convening services. Making effective use of the
wealth of knowledge available in the Bank, Colombia also relied on the Bank‘s support to

54

evaluate different policy alternatives and proposals. While often associated with lending
activities, much of the knowledge work was specifically designed to address direct requests or
particular issues. An important characteristic of the Colombia program was the inclusion of
programmatic multisectoral knowledge services, designed to be an open multi-year engagement
in a particular area. The annual activities were determined after a review of previous
accomplishments and the evolving needs of the country. Finally, during the political transition to
a new administration in mid 2010, the Bank prepared policy notes in areas of special interest to
the incoming authorities. These were discussed with the newly elected President Santos and
Government members, and offered an excellent entry point for engagement with the new
authorities.
55. The implementation of the program entailed close supervision and periodic reviews of the
portfolio. The Bank‘s supervision occurred though continuous monitoring and evaluation of the
activities, both at the project and country level. The high-quality of Bank lending during the CPS
period was evidenced by a generally satisfactory progress in portfolio implementation and by the
achievement of the project‘s development objectives (see Table 3.1). Policy-based lending played
an important role in producing results.
56. The current Administration has underlined the need to strengthen the institutional capacity of key
government entities to optimize the implementation of investment projects, in particular civil
works financed with public funds at the national level. The government, led by the Ministry of
Transport, is exploring an appropriate strategy, including a review of the legal framework,
enhancing procurement processes and external controls, in addition to strengthen the technical
capacity of the executing agencies.
57. To that end the Bank has maintained close scrutiny of the portfolio in Colombia and timely
addressed procurement issues that have been uncovered during Bank supervisions. In addition, in
close coordination with the borrower, the Bank has incorporated a broad set of measures into both
project implementation and supervision to strengthen the overall fiduciary control framework and
to safeguard individual operations.
58. The 2008 Country Performance Portfolio Review (CPPR) focused on assessing the quality of the
portfolio with respect to necessary adjustments in relation to the CPS. As a consequence of the
CPPR, three projects were restructured that showed problems on implementation and slow
disbursements. The 2010 CPPR focused on establishing a new coordination mechanism between
the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Department, the Social Action Department, and
the Bank for the implementation and discussion of the grants pipeline.

59. Much of work of the Bank Group was carried out in partnership with other development partners.
The Bank continued to build excellent relations with groups involved in the development agenda
of Colombia. The work with agencies extending bilateral support included joint activities in the
area of environment, climate change, and the peace and development agenda. While the
Government coordinated much of this work, the financing from bilateral partners was critical for
the success of some Bank-supported programs. The Bank has worked closely with the European
Union and the UN System on peace and community development in areas affected by violence.
60. The Nordic countries were also closely engaged, especially in the areas of environmental
protection. In several programs, the Bank co-financed and worked in close coordination with the
IDB, such as in conditional cash transfers, water and sanitation, and science and technology. The
Bank and IDB also closely coordinated in furthering the development of country systems and
prepared a program to pursue shared documentation. The alliances also involved NGOs,
particularly those involved with efforts to consolidate the peace process and create the conditions
for more inclusive communities. A well-publicized alliance took place with Shakira, a famous
Colombian artist, who is leading an international effort to promote greater attention to early
childhood development programs.
C. Management of Risks
61. The risks originally identified in the CPS were well managed. The CPS anticipated potential
difficulties emanating from external shocks. The subprime financial crisis and reductions in trade
with neighboring countries actually materialized and led to the need for additional financing.
Naturally, the overall magnitude of the crisis was beyond any initial estimate, and the rapid
exposure to Colombia was not fully anticipated. The domestic risks to the strategy, which
included both overheating of the economy and political factors, did play a significant role. In
fact, the political transition was much smoother than foreseen with a continuity of programs and
an excellent relationship with the new authorities.
IV. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
62. The CPS was designed to be flexible and innovative in responding to Colombia’s financial and
development needs. The IFC also adapted its Colombia strategy and diversified its portfolio
with new projects. This flexibility allowed the Bank to explore new avenues of resources, mainly
through trust funds, that financed unanticipated Government requests for knowledge and advisory
services. Just-in-time technical assistance tailored for particular requests, policy dialogue, global
knowledge transfer and a fully integrated trust fund portfolio resulted in an important and
innovative aspect of the program. Colombia was one of the first Bank clients to take advantage of
the flexible DPL with Catastrophe Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) as part of its integrated
approach to disaster risk management. Combined with the other ongoing activities by the Bank -which span the range of financial and knowledge services -- Colombia has one of the most
integrated programs in risk management of any Bank client. Its multi-year, knowledge and
advisory programmatic approach, where IBRD had an on-going engagement with the
Government in key areas, defined the annual work program (for knowledge and convening
services) according to the existing needs at the time. The IFC advisory program also expanded in
Colombia, and its services were also based on strategic aims. This flexibility and just-in-time,
multi-sectoral programmatic advisory approach proved to be effective and should be maintained.
63. Good Governance and increased transparency in Colombia’s economy remains challenging
and the performance of public financial management (PFM) systems including public
procurement is a critical factor for fiscal discipline, strategic allocation, operational efficiency
and transparency in use of public funds. The Bank will therefore continue to pay special
attention to PFM issues to support the Government in enhancing its operational efficiency,

56

ensuring sustainability of the procurement reform, including improving country intuitional
capacity, creating of a public procurement bureau, enhancing transparency, promoting
participation of the private sector, and the creation of a more efficient compliant mechanism.
64. With the Government of Colombia wanting to borrow more than currently possible under Bank
exposure limits — it is advisable to agree with the Government on an integrated package of
financial, knowledge, and convening services with a focus on providing customized resultsfocused development solutions in areas where the Bank Group can add value. In this context, it
will be important for the WBG to increase its efforts to leverage resources from other
development partners and to maximize it development impact by created better synergies among
different sectors in support of the Government‘s program.

Annex C: The Impact of Higher Food and Commodity Prices in Colombia
As a net exporter of food, Colombia can reap benefits from higher agricultural prices. In 2010,
the country exported around US$5.7 billion (14 percent of total goods exports) of agricultural
products and processed food and showed a food trade surplus of US$1.9 billion (0.7 percent of GDP).
The main export product is coffee (US$2.2 billion), followed by vegetables and fruits (US$860
million) and sugar (US$674 million). In spite of the commodity boom, Colombian agricultural
exports have lost global market share, declining from an average 0.68 in the period 1995-1999 to 0.55
in 2000-2009. Nonetheless, Colombia has a great potential to expand agricultural production and
exports and the Government is taking measures to increase productivity.
In contrast with global trends, food price inflation in Colombia is declining. Food price inflation
fell from 4.8 percent to 2.8 percent between January and April 2011. As of April 2011, food inflation
contributed by 0.8 percentage points to the overall rate of 2.8 percent (the weight of food items in the
Consumer Price Inflation index is 28.2 percent). This trend is consistent with IMF (2011) estimates of
the pass-through from world to domestic food prices. Colombia has the lowest estimated passthrough among major Latin American economies (about 0.1), which is not even statistically
significant. Local food prices could, however, increase in the future since the impact of the last global
food price shock in 2008 appeared with a time lag (see Figure C1a). Given that poor people devote a
higher share of their household budgets to food, they experience a higher rate of inflation than the rest
of the population when food prices rise. In April 2011, the inflation rate of low-income groups was 33
percent higher than high-income groups and 2 percent higher than the middle-income group.

Colombia is a net exporter of oil, coal, gas, and metals, and experiences benefits as well as
challenges of higher prices. In 2010, export of these commodities reached US$25.6 billion and
contributed by 63 percent to total goods exports and by 73 percent of foreign direct investment
(US$4.9 billion). Commodities also contribute by about 12 percent to total fiscal revenues. Higher
commodity prices increase export and fiscal revenues thereby improving both the external current
account and fiscal balances. On the other hand, higher foreign exchange inflows add to appreciation
pressures, which potentially undermine the competitiveness of non-commodity exports. Colombia
can also not escape the negative impact of higher oil prices on the global economic recovery, and is
particularly sensitive to developments in the US – its largest trading partner. Recent measures taken
by the government to manage commodity revenues, such as the introduction of stabilization funds at
the national and subnational levels, are supported by this operation.

The inflationary impact of higher global oil prices is modest owing to government intervention,
but local fuel prices are likely to increase in the future to ensure fiscal balance. In 2008, the
Government abolished direct fuel price subsidies and introduced a Fuel Price Stabilization Fund,
which works on the following basis. During periods of low global prices, local pump prices are kept
relatively higher and this gives rise to savings. In spells of high oil prices, local prices are raised, but
not fully, with the difference paid for by drawing down the savings of the Fund. Given this
mechanism, local transport prices have only followed the rise in global crude oil prices to some extent
in recent months (see Figure C1b). Econometric estimates of the pass-through suggest that it is the
lowest in the region (after Mexico) at about 0.175 and statistically significant, according to the IMF
(2011). While the mechanism may work well in theory, the timing of its implementation gave rise to
only a limited period of relatively low world prices and savings accumulation followed by a period of
high prices. As a result, the Fund recently exhausted its savings in end-2010 and registered a deficit
of COP950 billion or US$530 million in end-April 2011. To avoid fiscal imbalances, further local
price increases would thus be necessary.

Annex D: Recent Trends on Poverty and Inequality in Colombia
Colombia is not a poor country, but it is a country with a lot of poor people. The poverty rate
and gap observed for Colombia is far greater than one would expect based on the level of
Gross National Income per capita observed in the country (Figures D1 and D2).
Figure D1. Poverty and per capita GNI relationship

Figure D2. Poverty Gap and per capita GNI relationship

Part of this is due to the high and persistent income inequality in Colombia. Between 1995
and 2009, a period when most LAC countries observed an unprecedented reduction on
inequality, Colombia experienced a relatively stable Gini Index (Figure D3a). Poverty
reduction during the 2000-2009 could have been stronger if Colombia had experienced more
79

equitable economic growth (leading to lower inequality). Figure D3b simulates what would
have happened to poverty in 2009 if Colombia‘s distribution of income was similar to that in
other LAC countries. For instance, had Colombia‘s Gini been similar to that of Mexico,
moderate poverty would have been 38 percent; while if it had been at the level of Uruguay
(the lowest in the LAC region), poverty would have been 26 percent.

Poverty (extreme and moderate) reduction in Colombia between 2000 and 2009 was entirely
driven by growth, as inequality remained largely constant. During this period, Colombia
experienced an average growth rate above the regional average. The Datt-Ravallion
decomposition (Table D1) suggests that, on average, 46 percent of the poverty reduction
between 2000 and 2009 among LAC countries can be attributed to growth and 54 percent to
redistribution. In the case of Colombia, the share due to growth was 97 percent, while falling
inequality contributed only 3 percent. The growth incidence curves for Colombia for 20062009 suggest that the middle class benefited the most from the income growth experienced
(Figure D4).

The relatively high poverty levels in Colombia are partially explained by the relatively high
levels of food prices. Table D2 shows the results of the International Comparison Program
(ICP) 2005 prices indexes for food items for LAC countries. This analysis shows that food
categories in Colombia were higher than regional average in 23 out of 29 categories (by an
average of 16 percent). The high cost of logistics (ranking of 82 in the WDI Logistic Cost
Index)4 the worst of the LAC region is expected to be a major factor behind the high food
prices.5 Evidence suggests that logistic costs represent between 20 to 50 percent of food
prices.6

Annex E: Fiscal Risk Management in the Colombian Public Sector
I.

INTRODUCTION

Fiscal risks can be broadly defined as deviations of fiscal outcomes from what was expected as the
time of the budget or other forecast7 and can arise from both revenues and expenditures, principally
as a consequence of exogenous shocks such as volatility of currency and interest rates, closure of
international financial markets, natural disasters, volatility of commodity prices, etc., combined with
the Government‘s exposure to these shocks. The time horizon should be defined for quantification
and management of fiscal risk; in Colombia‘s case, it could include reference8 to the Government‘s
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) in the next five to ten years, as well as next year‘s budget
and possibly other fiscal forecasts.
The Colombian authorities are well along the curve of identifying, quantifying, and managing various
types of fiscal risks. The authorities acknowledge the obligation to address many of the potential risks
— direct and indirect, explicit and implicit — by including them in the MTFF and in setting fiscal
targets. However, it would be prudent for the authorities to decide on an explicit strategy for dealing
with remaining sources of medium-term budgetary risk arising from factors such as natural disasters.
II.

SOURCES OF FISCAL RISK

Initially the analysis has been limited to the central government balance sheet,9 although the MTFF
also applies to the consolidated public sector. The analysis includes the accounting balance sheet, an
expanded ―fiscal‖ balance sheet, and contingent assets and liabilities, both explicit and implicit.
Figure E1

Figure E2

The government asset and liabilities with potential fiscal risk can correspond both to an accounting
and a fiscal simplified balance sheet (Figure E1). The Colombian Government has an accounting
balance sheet so the main items could be analyzed in terms of fiscal risk, namely, identifying and
ideally quantifying how much the value of the asset or liability change, given a movement in the
7

Cebotari and others, Fiscal Risks: Sources, Disclosure and Management, (IMF, FAD, 2009).
Country Insurance: Reducing Systemic Vulnerabilities in LAC (World Bank, Nov.2007), which concludes that countries
should cover themselves against insurable external shocks, providing insurance is offered at reasonable costs, and having
considered main fiscal risks arising from exogenous shocks.
9
Ideally it would be extended to the public sector as a whole, due to the decentralized nature of the Colombian Government.
8

83

source of risk (e.g., interest rates, currencies). The bottom items refer to a ―fiscal balance sheet‖,
which is necessary to understand the risks to the Government‘s budget. The most important source of
risk is usually the rate of economic growth, but it is possible to identify other vulnerabilities of the
revenue and expenditure streams to factors that can decrease revenues and/or increase expenditures,
in comparison to the original budget and other forecasts.
It is also necessary to analyze sources of fiscal risk that are contingent on events/variables, namely,
contingent liabilities and assets (Figure E2). In turn these can be classified as explicit or implicit: the
former refers to Government‘s legal obligations to make a payment (liability) or receive revenues
(asset) only if a particular event occurs. The latter refers to liabilities that arise but on which the
Government is not legally obliged to act, and which are typically excluded from the Government
balance sheet.
A. Criteria for identifying sources of fiscal risk
The criteria for identifying sources of fiscal risk are as follows:
(a)

Government assets and liabilities that -have a potential exposure to shocks (e.g., currency, interest rate, volatility in the price
of commodities, credit defaults), which could impact the MTFF or other medium-term
fiscal forecasts; and
10
(ii) lack a reasonable or successful risk management strategy and/or have difficulties with
its implementation, such that shocks may have a significant impact on fiscal forecasts
such as the MTFF.
(i)

For example, these could include a government loan portfolio whose value could be
diminished by credit risk factors (e.g., default by the borrowers), or investments in stateowned enterprises that go bankrupt.
(b) Contingent liabilities with potential exposure to shocks (e.g., natural disaster that can have an
effect on higher expenditure related to government insurance for agricultural produce,
disaster mitigation expenditure for affected population, etc) with estimated expenditures not
included in the medium-term fiscal forecasts, including MTFF.
The contingent liabilities already included in the fiscal forecasts would not be considered
fiscal risks as they are already taken into account (e.g., government guarantees for
infrastructure) unless, as in the case of legal demands against the Government, there are flaws
in the system for managing its risk (i.e., lack of an adequate information system on legal
demands).
The accounting balance sheet allows an identification of the government direct assets and
liabilities, as well as explicit contingent liabilities; an economic balance sheet includes the
Government‘s tax revenues and expenditures, as well as implicit contingent liabilities of
various types.11

10

The success of the strategy has to be analyzed in terms of whether it is indeed limiting/preventing a fiscal impact arising
from the risks being dealt with and whether it is ―reasonable‖ from a technical point of view — for example, a debt
management strategy that is highly speculative (i.e., based on market views) and that does take into account reducing
medium-term cost within prudent risk limits would not be considered ―reasonable ‖.
11
In addition, the Colombian authorities have already estimated expected cost and maximum cost with 95% probability of a
number of contingent liabilities.

in 2010, according to MTFF);
Oil price shocks (revenues are 13 percent of fiscal revenues annually and rising; requires
updated risk quantification);
Natural disasters (total value exposed is equivalent to US$173 billion, including publicly
owned assets and the private assets of low-income groups). The fiscal risk is calculated
by adjusting the value exposed with the probability of a disaster event. Estimated fiscal
risk equivalent to US$316 million a year; PV is 18 percent of GDP in 2011-50 period.12

There are other implicit contingent liabilities such as financial sector risk, which can be

WORLD BANK
MANAGEMENT

ADVISORY

SERVICES/PRODUCTS

FOR

FISCAL

RISK

The World Bank is assisting the Colombian Government13 in its design of medium-term fiscal risk
management strategies for the specific sources of fiscal risk mentioned above and for a
comprehensive strategy for the central government, taking into account total fiscal exposure. Working
closely with the Colombian authorities, it will do so by providing the following services and financial
products:
(a) Definition of fiscal risk management objectives;
(b) Identification, together with the Colombian authorities, of potential fiscal risks and mapping
of those same risks, taking into account the accounting and fiscal balance sheet, as well as
Colombia‘s explicit and implicit contingent liabilities;
(c) Identification of methodologies/models for quantifying risk;
(d) Quantification of fiscal risk;
(e) Analysis of the Government‘s capacity to absorb some or all of the risk, that is whether it has
a high degree of fiscal flexibility (e.g., provided by fiscal surpluses, fiscal buffers and
stabilization funds, a low-debt level, a low-risk debt structure, diversified funding sources,
lack of budgetary rigidities, etc.);
(f)
Assistance to the Government in its design of risk management strategies, including:
(i) Definition of objectives and time horizon for dealing with potential shocks, followed
by evaluation of different risk-management alternatives, taking into account the
following aspects:
 risk avoidance/reduction using policy dimensions;
 risk retention/self-insurance, related to the Government‘s macroeconomic
capacity to absorb fiscal risk (e.g., natural hedges, fiscal buffers, contingent
credits, instruments to leverage funding from international financial
institutions, leveraging concessional financing for climate change, etc.);
 risk transfer, whereby fiscal risk is transferred to third parties market — using
interest rate swaps, currency swaps into desired currencies, including local
12

Fiscal risk can be analyzed and managed at the level of the public sector, the central government, sub-national
government and/or different state-owned entities.

currency, natural disaster insurance, weather hedges as, for example, rainfall
indexes, financing of low-carbon investments in the market, swaps, options
and/or forwards for oil price risk, loans tied to oil price indexes, etc.
 cost-risk trade-off of alternative strategies and instruments;
 coordination of proposed alternatives with macroeconomic policy;
 constraints of the financial markets, which may limit the strategy choices;
 institutional capacity for risk management strategy design and implementation,
including coordination among different government units (e.g., governance,
strategy approval, delegation, accountability, reporting, technical capacity,
etc.).
(ii) Advisory services in the use of financial products for strategy implementation (e.g.,
CAT-Bonds, oil-linked debt) and analyze the different sources which provide these
products;
(iii) Training and institutional capacity building in all these areas, so as to make risk
analysis and management sustainable in the future, be it at a central, state, and subnational government level.
The different Bank departments will work together to provide an integrated, comprehensive fiscal
risk-management service to Colombia. A simplified risk management exercise is described in Figure
E3.

Annex F: Colombia and South-South Knowledge Exchange (SSKE)
World Bank Institute Brokering Pilot

South-South Cooperation (SSC) is an important national priority for Colombia.
Colombia‘s National Development Plan identifies International Relevance through SouthSouth Cooperation as a key cross-cutting theme, and the Government has striven to
strengthen the planning, funding, and implementation of South-South Knowledge Exchange
(SSKE), while promoting Colombia as a potential partner for SSKE regionally and globally.
The Government has formulated approaches for South-South learning for the Caribbean and
Mesoamerica, and established funding sources for SSKE, such as its Cooperation and
International Assistance Fund. They are also planning a cooperation strategy with Africa and
the Asia-Pacific region. Colombia‘s Accion Social has begun the important task of
documenting the country‘s rich history of exchanges, which has included sharing knowledge
in social promotion, disaster management, and other diverse sectors. Accion Social has
developed a ―Good Practice‖ guide to catalyze the development of SSKEs and showcase
Colombia as a potential knowledge supplier. Colombia is also active with international
organizations and partners to improve the design and monitoring of SSKEs, with a view to
strengthening the effectiveness of knowledge exchange within the global aid framework.
Colombia’s strong commitment to SSKE, which parallels a growing international focus
on South-South Cooperation, underlies its participation in a Pilot Brokering
Mechanism supporting SSKE coordinated by the World Bank Institute (WBI), which
aims to help countries document their knowledge sharing needs and facilitate matches
for exchanges. In late 2010 WBI launched the Brokering Mechanism in response to
increasing requests from client countries for assistance in systematically documenting
knowledge offers and requests, identifying partners, and implementing follow-up learning
activities. The Pilot is now working with 13 countries, and is expected to focus in 2011 on
identifying a small initial set of supply and demand areas, assisting Country Teams in
engaging governments to document these areas, and brokering matches, mainly through a
community of practice and integration of requests and offers into an online portal. WBI can
also provide assistance on implementing follow-up exchanges, particularly through its
planned launch of an online SSKE Knowledge Hub, which will feature a design toolkit for
exchanges and links to funding sources. Given Colombia‘s strong commitment and evidence
of government interest in working with the World Bank on SSKE, the Country Team has
chosen to participate in this Pilot. Over the course of 2011, the Country Team will work with
Colombian authorities to identify initial supply and demand areas, document these areas
using WBI templates, and provide assistance to identify matches within the evolving
community of practice, which will engage network and country staff throughout the Bank.
Initial dialogue with the Country Team and the Government on the Pilot has identified
several possible areas for engagement. On the supply side, Colombia may be interested in
sharing its expertise in public sector governance, health sector reform, urban mass transport
(Transmilenio), and Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs. The World Bank is
currently engaged in these areas, notably urban transport and social promotion. Colombia
may be interested in being a knowledge recipient in early childhood development, royalty
management and management of economic transitions, such as accession to the Organization
87

for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Colombia has already received
funding for four active exchanges in these and other areas funded by the Knowledge and
Learning Council through a WBI-sponsored South-South Knowledge Exchange Competition.
These exchanges are detailed below:
 Achieving Universal Health Care: Colombia together with Chile and Turkey are
sharing knowledge with the Philippines on options and strategies for expanding health
insurance coverage and ensuring high quality healthcare.


Developing the Capacity of the Ecuadorian Ministry of Finance: Ecuador‘s Ministry
is receiving assistance from counterparts in Colombia, Chile, and Peru to develop
capacity in results based budgeting and management of fiscal contingencies.



Measuring Learning Outcomes in Tertiary Education: Colombia is helping the
Moroccan government to build capacity to assess the quality of education in Moroccan
universities and devise strategies for allocating resources.



Enhancing Knowledge on Employment Policies: Colombia along with twelve other
nations mainly in Latin America and Asia are sharing knowledge on ways to design and
implement employment programs in post-crisis settings.

Colombia is a co-chair the Task Team on South-South Cooperation, an international coalition
of countries, multilaterals, donors, academic institutions, and other stakeholders that aims to
develop good practices and policy guidance for South-South learning activities. Launched in
2009, the SSC Task Team has engaged in a global dialogue on South-South Cooperation in
the context of the broader aid effectiveness agenda, including through analytical work, case
study development, and a community of practice. Colombia‘s Director for International
Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs co-chairs the SSC Task Team, while technical
leadership of the SSC Task Team resides in the Presidential Program for Social Action and
Accion Social. Both the SSC Task Team and Colombia are expected to play important roles
in the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea in late November
2011.

Annex G: Colombia Client Survey 2011
Between February and March, 2011, 402 stakeholders of the World Bank Group in Colombia
were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank‘s assistance to Colombia by participating
in a country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the offices of the
President, Vice President, Ministers, or Parliamentarians; employees of a ministry,
ministerial departments, or implementation agencies; local government officials or staff;
bilateral or multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; NGOs (including CBOs); the
media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia or
research institutes; and the judiciary. A total of 147 stakeholders participated in the country
survey (37%). Respondents were asked about the role and performance of the Bank as well
as about general issues facing the country.
Familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 7.1 on a 10-point scale (1 being not
familiar and 10 being familiar). This was statistically similar to the FY ‘07 survey, in which
familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.7 across all respondents. The Country
Survey suggests that overall optimism about Colombia‘s future has increased since FY 07
from 6.4 to 7.3.
Colombia’s development priorities. While the same constellation of development priorities
seems to be of most concern to stakeholders over the years, the research suggests that
education is now of greater concern to respondents, whereas in FY 07, poverty reduction was
considered by a strong plurality of respondents as the top development priority in Colombia.
Aligned with this finding, fifty percent of respondents said that education was the key factor
to reducing poverty (followed closely by employment opportunities). Throughout the
survey, peace and development was identified as an important factor in a number of
challenges by a relatively noticeable percentage of respondents.
The Bank Group’s top priorities. Respondents across all stakeholder groups and both
geographic locations indicated that they thought the Bank‘s top priorities in Colombia were
poverty reduction, economic growth, and infrastructure development. Respondents indicated
that it would be most productive for the Bank to focus most of its resources on access and
quality of education, infrastructure development, increasing employment, and reducing
poverty.
The World Bank’s value. They FY 11 Country Survey in Colombia suggests that while a
significant majority would like to see the Bank more involved in the country, and overall
effectiveness ratings have gone up significantly since FY 07 (6.3 – 7.0) greater emphasis on
its knowledge might be worth greater consideration. For example, ratings of the Bank‘s
technical competence, producing and sharing knowledge and research that are useful, sharing
knowledge about international best practices, and adapting knowledge to the country‘s needs
have all gone down significantly since FY 07. In addition, when asked how the Bank could
be of greater value in Colombia, nearly all the top choices are related to knowledge sharing,
knowledge coordination and knowledge services (in FY 07 there was more emphasis on
financing) . This is a critical aspect of the Bank‘s work in middle income countries.
89

Strengths and weaknesses. While effectiveness ratings in terms of poverty reduction are
still relatively low in Colombia, the Bank‘s ratings increased significantly in this area. Its
ratings also increased in work related to strengthening the environment and natural resource
management (an emerging priority in the country), as well as broader issues such as ‗lending
in a way that promotes effective development‘ and supporting ‗programs and strategies that
are realistic for Colombia.‘
In terms of overall relationships, the Bank is considered highly respectful, and respondents
note that they like to work with the Bank. This is similar to findings in all other Country
Surveys in the region.
