Armenia Country Assistance Strategy
Executive Summary
i.
Armenia's economy has suffered from several shocks in recent years: a severe
earthquake in 1988,the break-up of the SovietUnion in 1991,the Nagorno-Karabakhconflict
in 1988-94, the 1998 Russia crisis, and the assassination of the top leadership in October
1999. Despite these problems,the Government's commitmentto a market-orientedeconomy,
and its considerable success in advancing structural reform, have helped generate growth
averagingover 5% a year since 1995.
ii.
Although macroeconomic performance has been strong, Armenia has not benefited
from commensuratejob creation or poverty reduction -- 55% of the population still live below
the poverty line. Part of the reason is lack of large-scaleentry of private enterprises, and little
restructuring of existing enterprises. New investment has been limited by interference in
business activities by government officials, a serious shortage of appropriate skills, and
investors' perception of high political risks. Human capital has deteriorated, in part through
migration. This has had deleterious effects both on quality of life and on the economy as
Armenia's once abundant skill base has eroded.
iii.
To address these constraints the Government has articulated in its Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategythe need for progress in three key areas:
* Improvingthe business environmentby reducing administrativebarriers to investment
and new entry, especially of foreign firms, building effective public-private
consultative mechanisms, and enforcing a level playing field for new and existing
companies.
* Strengtheningpublic sectormanagement and reducing corruption, so as to improve the
provision of public services and the conditions for private sector growth. This
requires streamlining public administration, including the civil service and key
regulatory agencies, and advancingjudicial reform.
* Rebuilding human and physical capital, with an emphasis on ensuring additional
financing of school education, basic health, and infrastructure maintenance, and
improvingthe targeting of expenditures for social protection and education.
iv.
The World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supports reforms and
investments in these three key areas. Base Case lending is envisaged to be US$150 million in
FY02-04. Should the Government accelerate its reform program, a Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) of US$40 million could be added in FY04, bringing total lending to
US$190 million. With good performance, IDA partial risk guarantees for privatizations and
for new export-orientedinvestments could also be considered.
v.
In the Low Case, the focus would be on capacity building to improve the institutional
ability to implement future reforms, as well as on human development, rural development,
and environment initiatives which can contribute to long-term poverty alleviation even with
poor governance. Total IDA lendingwould then be about US$80 million.
vi.
Triggers for continuing in the Base Case focus on satisfactory development and
implementation of: (i) the macroeconomic program, as evidenced for example by
implementation of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Program; (ii) the Poverty Reduction

-iv-

Strategy Paper (PRSP); (iii) the reform agenda, including social service delivery and the
business climate (with a tangible reduction in corruption and government interference in
private sectoractivity); and (iv) IDA-financedprojects.

Risks
The CAS faces several political and economic risks. The Caucasus have historically
vii.
been a region buffeted by competing political forces. In the event of renewed conflict, the
Bank would endeavor to focus on the most poverty-oriented investments, but a temporary
cessation of new lending, and perhaps even disbursements,might be unavoidable, and the
Board would be updated in this event. On the other hand, there are prospects for a peace
agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh. In this case, the Bank would update the Board on proposed
support for post-conflictreconstructionand development.
viii. The CAS could be undermined by unexpected loss of momentum in judicial and
public administration reform, reduced overall levels of external financial and technical
assistance, lower population estimates, or by a failure to improve the business environment.
Any of the these outcomes could move Armenia toward a scenario in which the debt burden
becomes unsustainablerelative to exports and/or revenues. Key factors in the downside risk
scenario are: the level of overall economic growth and investment,especially export-oriented
investment, and the grant element of new development assistance. This reinforces the
importance of Bank support for reforms which foster broad-based economic growth and
private investment,and improve the tax base and tax collection. It also suggests a continuing
role for the Bank in assisting the Governmentmanage and coordinateexternal assistance.

Issues for Board Discussion
ix.

In its discussion,the Board may wish to consider whether:
* The Base Case triggers and outcome indicators are adequate;
* The Bank should step up the regional focus of its analytical and technical assistance
before a peace settlement on Nagorno-Karabakhis reached;
* The proposed combination of lending and non-lending services is appropriate to
Armenia'sdevelopmentneeds.

MEMORANDUMOF THE PRESIDENTOF THE
INTERNATIONALDEVELOPMENTASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVEDIRECTORS
ON A COUNTRYASSISTANCESTRATGEYOF THE WORLD BANK FOR
THE REPUBLICOF ARMENIA

I. Context
1.
Background to the CAS. This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is being
presented to the Executive Directors alongside the Government's Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP), and the Joint Staff Assessment of that strategy prepared by
the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank. The CAS supportsthe Government'sstrategy as
defined in the I-PRSP. The Bank will update the CAS as necessary once the full PRSP,
which is expected during FY02, is completed.
2.
Country Background. Armenia is located in the Caucasus Region, neighboring
Georgia, Azerbaijan,Iran, and Turkey. The official population estimate is 3.8 million people, and GNP per capita was measured at US$490 in 1999. Because Armenia is small,
landlockedand mountainous,with few natural resources, it faces intrinsic economic disadvantages compared with many of its neighbors. To some extent this has been mitigated by
generous official developmentassistance of about 11%of GDP over the last five years.

II. Economic Trends
3.
Sharp Economic Decline since Independence. Following the break-up of the
Soviet Union in the early 1990sArmenia's economy suffered one of the severest contractions among transition economies. The main causes were: the conflict in NagornoKarabakh and the related blockade of major transportation routes; an inherited economic
structure which proved to be

uncompetitive; the hyperinflation of 1992-93 and the

2-3 hours a day, and perhaps

two-thirds of the population surviving on humanitarian assistance. While the economy has
since recovered significantly, output in 2000 was still less than 70% of Armenia's pretransition peak. More importantly,recent economic growth has not brought many tangible
social gains. Poverty and unemployment remain extremely high (Box 1), and surveys
suggest that the public does not have enough confidence in the benefits of market-driven
economic reforms. Emigration, particularly among the younger and better educated,
continues at a fast pace for such a small economy.
4.
Six Years of Economic Growth. Armenia's economy has grown for each of the
last seven years, at an average annual rate of 5.4%. Economicperformancepeaked in 1998
(see Chart 1 and Table 1), when GDP growth exceeded 7%, the budget deficit declined to

-2-

4.8% and inflation fell close to zero by year end. This improvement resulted from a
convergence of factors: the successful stabilization program that began in 1994/95; a
Government committed to structural reform, including in core sectors such as power
generation and agriculture; an expansion in private transfers from the Diaspora; and an
extraordinary program of international assistance, which helped finance a large current
account deficit.
5.
Resilience in the Face of Economic Shocks. Armenia's economic growth showed
a remarkable degree of resilience in the face of two major shocks of the late 1990s. First,
following the Russia crisis, Armenia avoided both an exchange rate crisis and an
acceleration of inflation, and, after a brief slow-down, the economy continued to expand.
Then in October 1999 several leading Armenian politicians, including both the Prime
Minister and Speaker of Parliament, were assassinated. The political aftermath of the
assassinations led to a significant deterioration in fiscal and investment performance.

Nonetheless, economic growth resumed by mid-2000. For 2000 as a whole, GDP growth
reached 6% despite a severedrought.

III. Economic Reform Successes and Risks
6.

Reform Commitment in the 1990s. Since independence in 1991, the Armenian

authorities have been committed to democracy and market-oriented principles.
Furthennore, Armenia has been more successful in implementing structural reforms than

most other former Soviet Union countries. Reform progress was most noticeable in the
followingareas:

-3-

Box 1: Poverty In Armenia
Poverty is widespreadin Armenia.Preliminaryresults from the 1998/99IntegratedHousehold
Surveysuggest55% of peoplelivebelowthe nationalpovertyline (definedin termsof nutritionand
otherbasicneeds). Thesurveyand othersourcesreveala numberof featuresof povertyin Armenia:
* Povertyin Arnenia is particularlyprevalentamongthe uneducated,unemployed,disabled,and
familieswith severalchildren,as wellas in ruralareasamongthe landless.In urbanareas58%of
the populationis belowthe povertyline,comparedwith 51% in ruralareas. Povertyis especially
severein townsin theearthquakezone,with75%of peoplein urbanShirakdistrictbeingpoor.
* However,absolute poverty(defined in terms of minimumnutritionalneeds) appears to have
declinedsincethe 1996HouseholdSurvey,especiallyin urbanareas. In 1998/99extremepoverty
wasonlyhalfa percentagepointhigherin urbanthanin ruralareas.
* Introductionof the new targetedfamily povertybenefit(whichtransferred1.5%of GDP to the

* Survey results indicate relativelylow consumptioninequality:the consumptionGini is 0.37,
indicatinga moderatelevelof inequality,whilethe expendituresof the richestdecileare estimated
at eleventimes that of the poorest. The povertyand inequalitysituationwill be furtherexplored
and updatedin the forthcomingPovertyStudy(FY02).
* Overallindicationsare that povertymight be becomingentrenchedin Armenia,with early signs
that the poor may have started disinvestingin humancapital. Poor familieshave difficulties
maintainingtheirchildrenat school- in somecases choosingto placetheir childrenin residential
institutions. There are also some indicationsthat poor childrencannot attend school regularly
becausetheyhaveto workto supporttheir families.

hasdeteriorated,notwithstanding
effortsto providea basichealthbenefitpackagefree of charge.
Source:1996and 1998/99Integrated
HouseholdSurveys
* Market environment. Successive Governments have pushed ahead with a

comprehensive liberalization of trade, prices and currency regulations, improved
tax and customs administration, strengthened commercial bank supervision, wideranging judicial and accounting reforms, a new Civil Code, and reform of tax,
company,banking, land and bankruptcy laws.
* Privatization. The authorities have divested about 85% of small and medium
enterprises, 75% of large companies, most agricultural land, and all but one
commercial bank (also offered for sale). The Government has issued tenders for
sale of the electricity distribution companies, and introduced private management
of the Yerevan Water Company. Telecommunications has been in private
ownership since 1998, but this has so far resulted in limited improvements in
access or reliability.
* Social Sector Reform. The Government has replaced most poorly-targeted
assistance benefits and privileges with better focused means-tested family benefits.
Aggregate poverty benefit payments have been sharply increased since 1999, and
administration improved.Comprehensivepension reform is now under preparation.
* Health and Education Restructuring. Armenia has initiated the first steps in
improving the efficiency of service delivery in both general education and public
health. The Government has begun rationalizing existing capacity, through both
consolidation and closures. Efforts are also underway to improve financial
management in schools and hospitals, and create stronger incentives and accountability mechanisms. While the first outcomes are encouraging, these reforms are

-4-

still at the pilot stage, and more decisive steps are needed in order for there to be
tangible results over the next 2-3 years.
7.

Political Context and Risks to Reform The political environment for economic

reforms in Armenia remains fragile. While there is a strong consensus among the major
political factions on longer-term economic reform objectives, Armenia's political elites
remain less cohesive on a number of important issues, such as sale of the electric power
distribution companies. Indeed Armenia's external security and the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict, not economic growth, remain their main preoccupation. There have been six
Prime Ministers since the 1997 CAS was presented to the Board, and the reform
momentumhas seen significantfluctuationsas a result. Uncertaintyand loss of confidence
following the October 1999 assassinations affected the economy through two main
channels: a drastic reduction of investment activity, including delays with finalization of
severallarge investment projects; and a 10% fall in tax collections.
8.
New Reform Momentum. The latest political crisis waned in May 2000 when
President Kacharyan appointed a new Government, led by Prime Minister Andranik
Margaryan, committed to full cooperation with different branches of power. The current
political environmentis generallysupportiveof the accelerationof reform. Recent reforms
have included a WTO compliant customs code, a new Law on Inspections that severely
limits discretionary audits of private businesses, simplified taxation of small businesses,
and establishment of a High Level Business Council to advance improvements in the
investment climate. The Government has persisted with its intention to sell the power
distribution companies, despite strong resistance from entrenchedinterest groups.
9.
Continued Investor Caution. Both domestic and foreign investors have been
alarmed at the existing and potential political uncertainties and risks, both from domestic
political instability and from the unresolvedNagorno-Karabakhconflict. This caution has
been undermining investmentperformance and eroding incentives for corporate restructuring. As importantly, the Government needs to address the legitimate concerns of private
investors in a timely manner.
10.
The Benefits of a Peace Settlement. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which
erupted in the period preceding the break-up of the Soviet Union ended in a cease-fire in
May 1994. As yet no peace settlement has been reached. This is a significantconstraint to
economic growth (Box 2). Political uncertainties surrounding resolution of the conflict
have depressed investment levels, especially of FDI. The conflict has also enhanced the
role of the military and other national security agencies, thereby compromising the Govermnent's ability to confront key vested interests. Defense and national security together
absorb 20% of central Governmentexpenditures, and this severely constrainsthe availability of public resources for other needs such as education and health. A peace agreement
would thus have three major economicbenefits. It would:
* Allow the opening of Armenia'sborders with Azerbaijanand Turkey.
* Increase the confidenceof investors, especially foreign investors.
* Enable the Government to free up resources for key development needs such as
health and education.
The Bank is working with the concerned South Caucasus countries to help devise ways to
reduce the cost of transport and trade disruptions, as well as help the Governments be
better prepared to secure the potential gains from peace. In the event of a peace agreement
the Bank would present an updated strategy to the Executive Directors.

IV. Paradox of Armenian Economic Growth
11.
Little Link between Growth and Poverty Reduction. Why has growth and
reform not lead to stronger poverty reduction outcomes - nor to more positive public
perceptions of reforms? The answer lies in the structure of recent growth, which has had a
narrow base and a limited impact on job generation and, hence, on poverty. Preliminary
results from the forthcoming (FY01) Growth Study suggest that manufacturing and
services growth has been heavily concentrated in Yerevan, and in only a few sub-sectors
(such as diamond polishing). Investment has also favored large enterprises (such as in
power) with a limited potential for new employment. At the same time most traditional
enterprises have continued to downsize, while creation of new private enterprises -particularly labor-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises -- has remained weak and
unable to absorb excess labor. Overall, most growth has taken place outside the
manufacturingsector -- the very sector where Armeniamay have the strongest comparative
advantage,particularly through its educated labor force. Agriculture and construction have
been the main contributors to GDP growth, but even in these sectors real labor incomes
have grown relatively slowly.
12.
What Went Wrong? Armenia's transition to a market economy was more
difficult and more prolonged than originally anticipated. In contrast to some of the
transition economies in Central Europe, Armenia has yet to see large-scale entry of new
private enterprises or investment. This is the root cause of Armenia's failure to reduce
poverty. Until new investment and restructuring accelerate, the current growth patterns
will not be sustaineddespite the successes of the last seven years. The summaryindicators
of industrial renewal - such as trends in merchandise exports and private investment suggest stagnation. Merchandise exports in 1999 were 10% lower than in 1995, and
amounted to just 13% of GDP. While Armenia has expanded its exports to the EU, North
America, and other new markets, the volumes have not yet compensatedfor the collapse of
traditional markets in the former Soviet Union countries. The prevailing business
environment has remained hostile to a stable inflow of new investment, including FDI.
For existing enterprises, the perceived riskiness of the business environment has unduly
favored short-term gains from asset sales over restructuring and investment. Even
establishment of new companies, backed by Diaspora investment, has been surprisingly

-6-

weak. Another strongly inhibiting factor is weak managerial skills, resulting from decades
of market isolation, and exacerbatedby a decade of border closures.
13.
Major Constraints to Faster Growth. Overall, three main factors appear to
reduce the employmentimpact of existing growth:
* Business environment. Excess interference in business activity by poorly paid
government officials has increased significantly the perceived costs of doing
business as well as made it difficultto attract new entry, including FDI. The fifteen
year monopoly granted in 1998 to Armentel, the telecommunication company
owned by the Hellenic TelecommunicationsOrganization(OTE), has not resulted
in significantlyimproved service, furtherreducing the attractivenessof the business
environment.
* Capacity of the private sector. The isolation of the Armenian economy has left a
serious shortage of management skills in the private sector, limiting the economy's
export potential and integration in the world economy.
* Political risks and blockade. Without resolving the regional conflict and removing the blockade, investment will continue to be constrainedby high transport costs
and perceptions of political risk.

V. Continuing Widespread Poverty
14.
Poverty Profile and Policies to Alleviate Poverty. Poverty in Armenia is
widespread and persistent (Box 1). A number of factors are responsible: (a) high
unemployment (according to the 1998/99 Household Survey, more than 25% of the labor
force), because of very limitedjob creation; (b) low wages for those jobs that are available;
(c) low productivity,with agriculture -- mostly subsistence -- accounting for a high share
of employment (over 40%). Extreme poverty, however, appears to have declined since the
1996 Household Survey, in part because of improved targeting of social assistance
benefits. Even in the face of severe fiscal constraints the Government has succeeded in
maintaining the poverty-oriented family benefit. In addition to restructuring safety nets,
the Government has been working to improve pension administration and strengthen the
public pension system to make it sustainable. Except during the second half of 2000, the
Government has been paying pensions and family poverty benefit on time and avoiding
accumulationof arrears. Additionally,the Social InsuranceFund managed to clear most of
last year's pension arrears, and with EU Food Security Program assistance has managed to
make regular family poverty benefit payments.
15.
GenderDimension of Poverty. By most measures gender inequality is relatively
low in Armenia. Educational enrollment is higher for girls than for boys at all levels of
education, from primary through secondary and secondary-professional to higher
education. Female life expectancy is over 78 years for women, as against less than 71 for
men. However, there is emerging evidence that the quality of life and opportunities for
women have deteriorated:64% of the registered unemployed are women; their labor force
participation rate is 55%, as against 77% for men; they bear the burdens of maintaining
families in times of economic hardship and of increased seasonal labor migration; they
have been badly affected by the decline of social services such as reproductivehealth and
child care. And women's role in public life at senior levels is relatively small, with female
representation in Parliament only 3%.

Poverty and Environment. Rising prices and falling incomes have forced many

people -- especially the poor -- to overuse Armenia's natural resources, continuing a trend

which started in the heavy industry days of the Soviet Union. Since independence a
number of problems have become especially severe: water scarcity, depletion of forests
and fisheries, land degradation, urban pollution and inefficient use of resources such as
drinking water. Improved management of environment and natural resources base is
crucial for long-term development. The Government has begun, in the context of a
recently completed National Environment Action Plan, to address the most serious and
immediate environmentalproblems, including the degradation of water and other natural
resources and threats to biodiversity.
17.
Capacity to Monitor Poverty. Armenia's capacity to monitor poverty remains
weak, mostly because there is no regular household income and expenditure survey, which
would be a vital data source on the economic and social conditions of the population (the
integrated household surveys of 1996 and 1998/99 were financed by donors). For these
reasons, the I-PRSP includes a commitmentto establishinga regular program of household
income and expendituresurveys.

VI. The Government Reform Agenda
Facilitating Export-Driven Job Creation in the Private Sector
18.
The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. The I-PRSP has three main pillars: (1)
sustainable and equitable economic growth, driven by a more dynamic private sector; (2)
public administration reform and an anti-corruption program; and (3) enhanced human
development.
* The I-PRSP commits the Government to improving the business environment
through reduced administrativebarriers to investment and new entry, especially of
foreign firms, building effective public-private consultative mechanisms, and
enforcing a level playing field for new and existing companies.
* The Government's strategy also focuses on improved public sector management
and reduced corruption,with the aim of improving the provision of public services
and the conditions for private sector growth. Strengthened public sector management will require streamliningthe civil service and key regulatory and controlling
agencies, advancingjudicial reform, and improvingdomestic revenue collection.
* The I-PRSP emphasizes rebuilding human and physical capital. This will require
additional financing of school education, basic health and infrastructure
maintenance(assuming improved revenue performance, and savings in financingof
lower priority items such as utility subsidies), and improving targeting of social
protection and educationexpenditures.
19.
Improving the Business Environment. There is a broad agreement that the next
stage of reforms needs to focus on improvements in the business environment in order to
facilitate investment, new entry and job creation. The Government is committed to
addressing this problem, and specificallyto:
* Lower the administrativebarriers to investmentand new entry mentionedabove.
* Improvethe transparency and technical quality of strategic privatizationprocesses,
with the objective of attracting strategic investors into the largest state-owned
companies.

-8-

* Support financial deepening by advancing policies (such as enforcement of
collaterallegislation)that would reduce lending risks and hence costs of borrowing;
continue the policy of consolidating the banking system, by requiring banks to
increase their capitalization.
* Improve the quality of infrastructure, especially in telecommunications, urban
water supply, and road, rail and air transportation;strengthen regulatory capacity to
supportprivately-ownedoperatorsin energy and infrastructure.
* Facilitate a revival of private agriculture through development of land markets,
improved irrigation and availability of rural credit, and promotion of agricultural
practices for sustainable use of energy, water, soil and pasture resources.
* Expand managementtraining and business developmentservices.
20.
Anti-CorruptionEfforts and Public AdministrationReform. The I-PRSP puts
improvedpublic administrationand reduced corruptionat the center of its strategy.
* Independent surveys suggest that corruption is a severe hindrance to sustained
growth and effective management of public services. Armenia appears to suffer
from a relatively low level of state capture (defined as firms influencingthe "rules
of the game" in their favor by bribing government officials), but very high
administrativecorruption,such as harassment by public officials.
-

To reduce corruption's ill-effects Armenia needs to: (i) enhance the transparency,
accountability, and capacity of its public administration; (ii) develop and
implement clear criteria for personnel management decisions in the civil service;
(iii) develop adequate institutional capacity for financial management, including
effective agencies for internal and external audit, the treasury system, and for
public procurement; (iv) advance implementation of the ongoing judicial reforms
program; and (v) encourage a larger role for civil society in policy making and
implementation (see also Box 3). In any event, expanded trade and private sector
ownership should lessen the opportunitiesfor corruption.

* Public administration reform will need to include a particular focus on improved
fiscal management given Annenia's low level of domestic revenues. A central
instrument is the Medium-Terrn Expenditure Program (MTEP), which will be
updated and mainstreamed,based on the initial draft prepared in late 1999. The full
MTEP will be built on: a) realistic macro-economic projections; b) strategic
prioritization of public spending;c) broad participation of respective agencies, and
d) performance evaluation, enhanced accountability and control over public
expenditures. Further development of the PRSP and the MTEP will need to be
coordinatedto ensure consistencybetween the Government'spoverty reduction and
expendituremanagement efforts. In connectionwith the MTEP, the Governmentis
beginning to strengthen the budget execution process, including improving budget
classification, expanding budget coverage of public expenditures,and streamlining
Treasuryfunctions.
Enhanced Human Development. Much remains to be achieved in the social
21.
sectors, particularly health and education. Much also remains to be done in the area of
social protection, so as to provide appropriateassistance, both in cash and kind to the most
vulnerablegroups, including those living in absolutepoverty, children and the elderly.
* Education. Enrollment rates in general education remain fairly high, indicating
still good access to public education. Nonetheless there are some indications that
enrollment rates may have started deteriorating, especially for the very poor. In
addition, the quality of education has substantially deteriorated. Public education
suffers: (a) severe government under-funding (2.1% of GDP, less than half the
lower middle-incomecountry average), which has caused deterioration in facilities,
lack of modem teaching aids, and low (and often delayed) teacher pay; (b) low
notional pupil-teacher ratios, but in practice class sizes close to the international
average; (c) rigid curricula and teaching methodology; and (d) inefficient and
distorting central financialmanagement control.
*HealthCare. Health care indicators are mixed, but life expectancy for both
women and men appears to be increasing, despite a higher incidence of both
communicable and non-communicabledisease. However, both infant and under
five mortality rates are high at 30 and 25 per 1000 respectively,and there has been
no improvement during the last few years. Immunizationrates are fairly good, but
only 7% of immunization costs are currently covered by the Government,
indicating high vulnerability to fluctuations in donor financing. The prevalence of
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS is increasing rapidly - while data on the incidence of
HIV/AIDS is very partial, the trend is nonetheless clear and alarming. The health
system suffers from: (a) severe governmentunder-funding(less than 1.4% of GDP,
as against a lower middle-income country average of 3.3% of GNP); (b)
overcapacity of the infrastructure, leading to wasteful resources use, especially in
hospitals; (c) relatively under-developed primary health care; and (d) increasing
out-of-pocket costs and worsening quality of services.
* Health Insurance. The Ministry of Health is considering introduction of
mandatory health insurance, which the Bank would caution against, as analysis
suggeststhat it would not improvehealth sector financing, but would increase labor
costs and further distort labor markets. The Bank believes that a more effective
course of action would be to focus on providing equal access to essential, costeffective preventive and primary health care services, while improving health
facilities.

-10-

Social Protection. In the short term further efforts to reduce poverty need to focus
on measures to improve social programs' administration, on targeting of poverty
benefits, and on the elimination of remaining badly targeted implicit subsidies in
public service and utility provision. The resources released through these two
measures could be allocated to increase the level of povertybenefits and pensions,
as well as to the development of social care services at the local level. The
Government also needs to avoid broad new social programs, which may be
unaffordable, especially in the area of unemployment support. Another barrier to
efficient prioritization of social assistance programs is the lack of a reliable census
which would show where the greatest needs are. This is a particularly important
issue given the large-scale emigration. A new census, currently planned for
autumn of 2001, is a major short tern priority.
22.
Priority Setting. While the I-PRSP focuses on the major challenges facing
Armenia, the Government will need, in the full PRSP, to focus more on how budget
priorities will be set. The I-PRSP does not discuss what the potential sources are for the
planned increases in spending on priority items such as primary health, general education,
old age pensions, and critical infrastructuremaintenance. Only part of this increase could
derive from improved revenue collection, and some further cuts in low priority sectors will
be necessary, with savings reallocated to priority sectors. An additional reduction in
subsidies in energy and infrastructureis especially important. The authorities also need to
undertake a critical evaluation of the current high level of military expenditures. The
World Bank and the Government plan to work together in preparing the Public
Expenditure Review.
23.
Labor Market Issues. The authorities need to implement decisive steps to change
labor legislation as an important part of the overall efforts to improve the business
environment. Reform of labor market institutions and policy would require: (i) replacement of the poorly targeted unemployment insurance with more modest, but more
equitable, unemployment assistance, thereby enabling the Government to lower payroll
taxation; and (ii) rationalization of employment services, with a focus on job search and
counseling services to the unemployed with some limited, demand driven, re-training
programs.
24.
Core Labor Standards. Armenia has a good record on core labor standards,
including:(i) eliminationof all forms of forced or compulsorylabor; (ii) effective abolition
of formal use of child labor; (iii) equal opportunityand non-discriminationin employment;
and (iv) freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Laws regulating
trade unions and collective bargaininghave substantiallymet the core labor standard goals,
and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Armenia has negotiated agreements on job
security, salaries, pensions, and social assistance. Binding contracts between workers
(with representation from grass-roots union organizations) and employers are common in
large enterprises,but have not yet taken firm root in smaller enterprises.

VII. Growth and Financing Prospects
25.
Growth Prospects. The Bank shares the view of the I-PRSP that Armenia could
grow by about 6% a year as the reform program deepens and initiatives to expand regional
cooperation develop. In the short term, these high levels of GDP growth are expected to
result primarily from higher capacity utilization. Over the medium term, as the potential
for increased capacity utilization is gradually exhausted,investment in new capacity could

-11-

play an increasing role in generating growth. This will require increased private sector
confidence, both domestic and foreign, and a financial sector that plays a more effective
role in channeling saving into investment. Thus, the gross investment rate, estimated at
17% in 1998, is targeted to rise to about 18.3% by 2003. The I-PRSP also includes an
optimistic scenario of GDP growth accelerating steadily to 9.0% a year in 2003; this
scenario assumes progress towards a peace settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh, greater
foreign investment and tourism, and reduced emigration. If this scenario is realized, the
Bank would providethe Executive Directors with an updated strategy.
26.
Export-Led Growth. Growth is expected to be led by export demand from both
traditional markets, and increasinglyalso from non-traditional markets, such as the Middle
East and Western Europe. So far, export trends have been quite volatile, reflecting both
the specific nature of some of Armenia's main export products (e.g. jewelry and processed
diamonds),weak capabilities of the local private sector, as well as the volatility of several
of Armenia's main export markets. Export growth of about 10% a year (in volume terms)
is projected throughoutthe 2001-05 period, assuming continued improvementsin both the
business environmentand relations with Armenia's neighbors. Infrastructure investments
designed to rehabilitate Armenia's transport and communications with neighboring
countries will significantly facilitate growth in external trade and the development of the
country's transit potential. Armnenia'shighly-educatedand entrepreneuriallabor force will,
despite recent erosion in education standards, remain a source of potential comparative
advantage. Nonetheless, export-growth will be significantly constrained as long as
Armenia's main export route remains costly and unreliable(see paragraph 10 above).
27.
MacroeconomicPolicy and External Financing. Currently, trends in merchandise export represent the weakest element of Armenia's macroeconomicperformance, and
a major source of macroeconomic vulnerability. Armenia's trade deficit is large and
amounted to 29% of GDP in 1999. While Armenia continues to benefit from the
considerableinflow of remittances and private transfers (7-8% of GDP a year) and official
transfers (on average 6% of GDP a year in 1998-2000),it still has considerableresidual
requirements for external financing. The current account deficit after official transfers is
projected to average 12% of GDP over the next three years. A residual financing gap of
about US$210 million is estimated for 2001-03. As indicated in paragraph 2, Armeniahas
over the last five years received generous external assistance, and about US$240 million
(equivalent to about 11% of GDP) is projected for 2001 -- about US$75 per capita (based
on a populationestimate of 3.1 million).
28.
External Debt and Debt-Servicing Capacity. Armenia's public external debt
stood at US$862 million, or 45% of GDP, at the end of 2000. The debt's relatively large
grant element (36%) reflects the large share of highly concessional IDA credits, and the
small share of non-concessionalcommercialdebt. Less than one fourth of total debt carries
variable interest rates. This composition of debt protects Armenia reasonably well against
higher international interest rates, or significant shifts in value of the major international
currencies. Although the current overall debt burden is modest in terms of the size of the
economy, it is high relative to expected export earnings. In terms of net present value,
external debt was estimated at end-1999 at 153% of export of goods and services and at
167% of fiscal revenues. The high debt-to-export ratio represents a constraint for
improvementsin Armenia's creditworthiness.
29.
Debt Trends. Debt ratios improved in 2000, after a 15% expansion in exports in
the course of the second part of the year. The medium-term scenario envisions further

-12-

gradual improvementsin the debt profile over the next several years, based on a stronger
export performance and a

30.
Downside Risk. The baseline macroeconomic scenario assumes that continued
prudent macroeconomicpolicies and a more market-friendlyinvestment environmentwill
elicit a strong private sector response. However, a less favorable external environment
and/or a loss of reform momentum,leading to weaker-than-expectedforeign and domestic
investment, poses serious downside risks (Table 2). Under a downside risk scenario,
export growth is assumed to be about a 1/3 lower and GDP growth 2 percentage points
lower than in the base case. Both the current account deficit and financing gaps are much
higher and lead to a more rapid build-up of external debt. The debt profile deteriorates
considerably and debt ratios

VIII. CAS Consultations
31.
Consultations. Both the I-PRSP and the CAS have been discussed with a wide
range of stakeholders in Armenia. The Bank's own discussions included focus groups

-13-

comprising members of civil society throughout Armenia, including NGOs, the foreign
and domestic private sector, development partners, and trade unions. The Sociology
Department of Yerevan State University and an NGO, Armenian Democratic Forum,
helped organize meetings in seventeen urban and rural locations. Every group was
enthusiastic about the chance to express their views, with some groups even deciding to
keep meeting on a regular basis. NGOs, the private sector and other representatives of
civil society were also active participants at two recent meetings in Yerevan -- the
discussion of the Institutional and Governance Review, and the Consultative Group
Meeting (Box 4). There were a number of recurring themes at each of these discussions.

Box 4. The October 2000 ConsultativeGroup Meeting In Yerevan

32.
Job Creation. Faster private employment generation was consistently seen as
critical to sustained poverty reduction. Participantspointed to a number of pressing issues:
* Small and medium businesses -- the most likely source of productive new jobs -are hampered by increasingly out-of-date skills and training, unpredictable and
burdensome enforcement of regulations, and especially what was seen as
unwarranted harassment by tax officials. Many small business owners said that
small enterprises are hampered by lack of market knowledge and market access,
with even simple informationsuch as on prevailingmarket prices hard to obtain.
* Distortions in the banking system were mentioned, with the private sector insisting
that there was strong demand for loans, which was tempered by a narrow definition
of allowable collateral, and notional interest rates being inflated by demands for
bribes. High interest rates, and lack of credit and associated collateralmechanisms,
were mentionedat grass-rootsmeetings.
Poor Governance and the Public Sector. Corruption and theft of public
33.
resources were also mentioned repeatedly. In the face of these problems most participants
sought greater local control over Government funds and over decision-making. Many
focus groups wanted more directly-elected local officials who could be held accountable

-14-

for administration of public monies. But they also acknowledged that low pay among
public officials made eliminating corruptionhard to achieve.
34.
Deteriorating Human Capital. The decline in social services was a major concern, affecting people's health, the education of their children and their ability to live with
dignity. Many participants perceivedthere to have been a steady decline both in the quality of education and health services, and in their availability. A deterioration in social
protection was also repeatedly mentioned. While participants saw inadequate funding of
social services as part of the cause of this malaise, a much larger problem was poor
administrationand lack of implementationof reforms.
35.
Follow-Up. In conjunctionwith Governmentand other stakeholdersthe Bank will
hold follow-up meetings, focusing in particular on the developmentpriorities of the poor,
and developinga close interaction with the PRSP process.

IX. World Bank Assistance Strategy
36.
The Last CAS. The objectivesof the Bank's assistance strategy, as defined in the
last (FY98) CAS, were to:
-

"Foster the rapid development of the private sector by promoting further structural
reforms, strengthening the financial system and the legal and regulatory framework,
and alleviating key infrastructurebottlenecksin energy, transportand water".

* "Support social sustainability and the alleviation of poverty through the strengthening of the social safety net, and through improvements in the quality of, and
access to, basic health and educationservices".
37.
Progress in Implementing the Last CAS. The Bank has successfullysupported
progress towards most of these goals, especially investments and reforms to improve
energy, transport, irrigation and water supply services, strengthening of the judicial and
financial systems, rationalization and targeting of social benefits, and improvements in
educational quality and access. Poverty remains high, but most of the other progress
indicators in the last Country Program Matrix were met, especially in the areas of
macroeconomicreform, financial rehabilitationof the power sector, restructuring of social
protection,and introduction of new financial mechanisms in general education- indeed the
macroeconomicbenchmarks were over-achieved. The area where the Bank has been least
successful is in promoting broad-based private sector development. In addition to
somewhatuneven implementation of structural reforms, dynamic private sector growth has
been more hampered by Armenia's isolation and political instability than the Bank had
anticipated. In addition, it was more difficult than expected to address the institutional,
bureaucratic, and legal obstacles to private sector investment (as recently detailed in a
Foreign Investment Advisory Service report). In the health sector the Bank was, in
retrospect, too optimistic that health financing reform would catalyze sectoral
rationalizationand downsizing. In particular the Bank did not anticipatethe difficulties the
Government had in reducing over-capacity, and in realistic budgeting in the face of
continuing revenue shortfalls. Recently,however, the momentum of health sector reform
has picked up considerably (see paragraph 6 above).
38.
The CAS Strategy. The Bank's strategy supports the I-PRSP approach, and
deepens elements of the previous CAS, including a more explicit emphasis on private
sector development as a pre-requisite for poverty reduction, as well as on governance and

-15social sustainability. The I-PRSP focuses on improving policy fundamentalsto create a
better environment for private sector growth, streamlined management of public goods,
and an increased stock of human capital. This would facilitate sustainablejob creation, a
larger tax base, and better government services, particularly in the social sectors. This
should in turn improve incomes and quality of life, and reduce poverty. Notably, the IPRSP progresses significantly beyond the Government's -- and the Bank's -- previous

strategy,by emphasizingmore the institutional barriersto private sector development. The
Bank particularly welcomes the I-PRSP's focus on consultationand monitoring, ensuring
that new policies are developed and assessedby a broad group of stakeholders,using welldesigned and measurable indicators. The Bank's support for the I-PRSP would focus on
three fundamental policy issues identified above: creating jobs through private sector
development; improving governance and public sector services; and rebuilding human
capital. While the span of the planned assistanceis relatively broad, the Bank believes it is
manageable as: (i) it is in areas where the Bank already has substantial knowledge and
involvement;(ii) the scope and size of the individualoperations is relatively modest, and in
most cases complements support from other donors; and (iii) these are areas where the
Bank already has substantial experienceof working with the Governmentand civil society,
and where the Bank has a good understandingof the institutionalcapacity.

A. Creating Jobs through Private Sector Development
39.
PRSP Focus. The I-PRSP emphasizes the vital need for job creation through
further improvement of the trade regime, further downsizing of the state enterprise sector,
more realisticpricing of government services, flexible labor markets, modernizationof the
legal and bankruptcy framework, improved infrastructure maintenance, and carefully
managed promotionof private sector investment. The Bank intendsto continue supporting
these reform efforts through a mix of lending and non-lending services.
40.
Improving the Entrepreneurial Climate. The Bank's strategy will build on
lessons from previous adjustment credits, which supported, inter alia, privatization,
enterprise and banking restructuring, capital market developmentand property rights. The
Bank will also build on the existing support for enterprise development,which has helped
to strengthencommercialbanks, the capital market, and enterprises' investmentand market
development capacities, and has financed a credit line for enterprise fixed investmentand
working capital. Effective implementationof the Fourth Structural AdjustmentCredit
(being presented to the Board along with this CAS) should promote improvementsin the
business climate and reduced corruption through: support for deregulation (liberalization
of licensing, registration, inspection, and reportingrequirements); reforms of the legal and
regulatory framework, and of tax and customs administration; improvements to land
markets; and strengthening of institutions and mechanisms that support strategic
privatizationand bankruptcy. The Governmentplans to establish a mechanismfor regular
monitoring of the costs of doing business, and of major bottlenecks for investments.
Lessons from the Bank's draft Growth Study (FYO1)have already been factored into the
design of SAC IV. To continue to support Armenia's structural reform program the Bank
is processing SAC V for FY03 Board presentation (or late FY02 if performance warrants).
The Credit would support further core reforms in the business environment and social
sectors. In addition, a Labor Market Study (FY03) would advise the Government on
removing impediments to labor market flexibility. IFC has made only one equity
investment to date (Hotel Armenia), and no loans, reflecting in large part a scarcity of
suitable investment opportunities. Throughoutthe CAS period, IFC will continue to seek

-16-

investments possibilities, and to offer the advice of the Foreign Investment Advisory
Services to further improvethe business environment.
41.
Promotion of the Private Sector. The forthcoming Growth Study (FY01) is
expected to develop a better understanding of the constraints to private investment in
promoting balanced and equitable growth, including the expected role of the rural
economy. In addition to ongoing support for infrastructure maintenance and enterprise
development, the proposed Private Sector Development LIL (FY02) builds on existing
analytical and project work, and would, together with SAC IV, support improvementsin
the policy and business environment. The project should also help strengthen local
managerial capabilitiesthrough expanding business services to private SMEs and secondment abroad of some of the best private sector managers. This LIL could be followedby a
fuirtherPrivate Sector Development Credit (FY04), to help improve business linkages.
The Bank is working with private business, as well as other donors and the Government,
on a strategy and action plan for the infornation technology and software industry. The
strong expansion of this industry over the last two years shows the potential for much
broader growth in various high-skill sectors. The Bank also intends to co-sponsor a
combined South Caucasus Trade Facilitation Workshop for Armenia, Azerbaijan and
Georgia later in 2001.
42.
Direct Support for Foreign Investment. For foreign private investors, Armenia
remains a high-risk country. Economic and political uncertainties are great, and the legal
aspects of doing business remain largely untested. IFC opened an office in Armenia in
February 1999, and is seeking private investment opportunities in this difficult market.
Three initiatives are under way. Along with a group of American-Armenianinvestors, IFC
is investing in the modernization of a hotel in downtown Yerevan. IFC is also developing
a Risk Capital Fund, which will use innovative financial instruments (quasi-equity/equity)
to target small and medium-size enterprises. Non-bank financial intermediariesmay offer
the best means by which to finance SMEs because Armenia's banks are weak and
undercapitalized, making financing through credit lines difficult. Also with the aim of
strengthening the SME sector, IFC is in the process of identifying a foreign technical
partner to establish Armnenia's first leasing company. Complementing its financing
activities, IFC has, under the newly established Private Enterprise Partnership, initiated a
Technical Assistance program designed to improve corporate governance practices and the
legal and regulatory environment for business development by working directly with
government officials and company managers, directors, and shareholders. In addition, a
new Technical Assistance Facility may be established in conjunction with the Risk Capital
Fund to support the Fund's investrnent initiatives. IFC is also working to encourage
foreign investment in Armenia by sponsoring a major international investors' conference,
with support from the World Bank, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and the
Armenian Government. The conference is planned for New York in May, 2001 and will
bring together entrepreneurs developing a range of private sector projects, and leading
investors from around the world with an expressed interest in Armenia.
43.
Guarantee and Advisory Support for Foreign Investment. The World Bank
Group is also catalyzing foreign investment through MIGA and FIAS. MIGA recently
provided a guarantee for an investment in the InternationalCommercial Black Sea Bank in
Armenia. FIAS has prepared a detailed and analysis of the barriers to investment in
Armenia. The recommendations of this report were highlighted and strongly endorsed at
the recent Consultative Group in Yerevan. A joint FIAS/MIGA initiative has been
providing short-term assistance to the Armenian Development Agency (ADA) in

-17-

preparation for the New York Investors Conference, and MIGA has been assessing the
possibilities for mounting a long-term technical assistance program to build ADA's
capacity to promote Armenia as a location for foreign investment. MIGA is currently
working with Bank Group to encouragethe Armenian Governmentto give greater priority
to the work of ADA, and with donor agencies to develop a partnership-based funding
approach to ADA's work program.

B. Improving Governance and Public Sector Services
44.
PRSP Focus. The I-PRSP emphasizes the need for restructuring public administration, further anti-corruptioninitiatives, more cost-effectiveadministration of urban and
rural public services where outright private ownership is not foreseen, and sustainable
management of natural resources. The Bank proposes to continue to provide support in all
these key areas.
45.
Governance. The Bank plans to deepen its broad focus on governance and corruption issues. One central element will be a Public ExpenditureReview (FY02), that will
cover not only institutional reforms, but also the development priorities for available
expenditures, given the weak revenue base and high level of defense expenditures. The
Bank's work on institutionaland govemanceissues, widely discussed at a workshop in
Yerevan in October 2000, is to be followed up with a Public Sector Reform Credit
(FY03), which will also build on the ongoing Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (FY02), and could include further technical assistance for structural reform.
The Public Sector Reform Credit would support strengtheningof public administrationand
executive decision-making, rightsizing and modernizing the civil service and making it
more accountable, improving public expenditure management and procurement
procedures, reforning intergovernmental finance, and strengthening the internal and
external audit functions. Periodic surveys of households and firms will be carried out to
benchmark and assess the progress of public sector reforms, especially in respect of
delivery of public services. Recently-approvedInstitutional Development Fund grants
aim to improve policy capacity and the quality of national accounts statistics, and
strengthen the capacity to plan, prioritize and implement the PRSP. Grant support is also
envisaged from the Public-PrivateInfrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) to support
the Government's request to create a single public services regulatory body in Armenia to
regulate monopoly aspects of energy (electricity, natural gas and network-basedheating),
telecommunications, and water and sanitation services, and to improve access to
communications. The regulatory body is to be created by enlarging the role of the Energy
Regulatory Commission to also cover other sectors which have significant natural
monopoly elements. Through the recently approved Judicial Reform Project (FY01) the
Bank is supporting a redesigned court administration and case management system,
improved court infrastructure, strengthened judicial training and enforcement of court
decisions, a comprehensive legal information database, and improved judicial public
relations capacity.
Utilities. The Bank proposes to continue to support the I-PRSP's emphasis on
46.
reforming the public sector's regulatory capacity of key services, such as energy, water,
sanitation, and telecommunications - including management contracts with private
operators.
Water and Sanitation. The Bank's focus is improving water service at lower cost
(but with increased cost recovery) to households -- especially the poorest
households. This is expected to bring significant health benefits, and reduce

-18-

responsibility of government for service provision, and strengtheningits regulatory
capacity. The Bank's existing municipal developmentcredit is helping improve the
reliability, quality and cost-effectivenessof water service by shifting management
of Yerevan's water company to an internationalprivate operator, and the Bank will
help introduce similar management contracts in other cities across Armenia under
the planned Municipal Water and Sanitation SectorCredit (FY02).
* Power. Electricity is the dominant source of energy for the economy. Through
adjustment and investment operations, the Bank has been supporting the technical
and financial rehabilitation of the power sector, its restructuring into a transparent,
independently regulated, market-based system, and the sale of shares in the
electricity distribution companies to strategic investors. Power privatization would
eliminate a quasi-fiscal burden of about 2% of GDP, improve the efficiency and
reliability of power supply, and secure private financing for the substantial
investments needed over the next ten years. An IDA partial risk guarantee is under
consideration to support privatization of the power distribution companies, and
further risk guarantees might be considered. The Bank has provided investment
support for electricity transmission and distribution through a credit which
constitutes the first installment of up to $53 million available over the next five
years under the Power Sector Restructuring and Development Program. SAC V
(FY03) could include a component for Energy Sector Adjustment,notably financial
rehabilitation and debt restructuring to facilitate the post-privatized electricity
market, and IFC could potentially co-finance further energy investments. The EU
and USAID are assisting Armenia develop an investment strategy to facilitate the
safe and early closure of the nuclear power plant at Medzamor, and the Bank would
support this through complementarylending (for example support for phasing out
electric heating through the proposed Heating Credit).
* Heating. The I-PRSP emphasizes the importance of improving the availability,
and reducing the cost and the environmentalimpact of heating. Household heating
is expensive (often second only to food in the household budgets of the poor).
Existing state-supporteddistrict heat suffers from non-payment of the order of $1012 million a year, but this "subsidy" benefits only about 10% of the population, not
always the poorest. Other urban consumers either use relatively costly electricity,
or use wood (causing an alarming pace of deforestation)in poorly ventilated apartments (causing indoor pollution resulting in respiratory ailments). Gas supply to
apartment buildings is being slowly restored, and is likely to be the main energy
source for home heating. Given the economies of scale and communal nature of
heating services in high population density urban areas, the Urban Heating
Strategy (FY02) is intended to propose mechanisms to create associations to take
"ownership" of building-level heating services, thus contributing to community
driven development. Support for implementation of the Strategy is possible
through an Urban Heat Credit (FY04). Given that Armenia has substantial
geothermal reserves, the Urban Heat Strategy will also examine this resource's
potential, as a cost-effectivealternative to traditional fossil fuels.
47.
Rural Services. The 2000 drought has had a devastating impact in some parts of
Armenia, with rainfed wheat and potato production down by 60-70% in the affected areas,
and the Bank is supplementingand restructuring the ongoing Dam Safety Credit (FY99) to
provide field preparation and tubewell rehabilitation for the spring planting. More broadly,
the Bank is supporting the Government's rural reform program, which promotes further
cost recovery in irrigation, strengthens land property rights and land markets by

-19-

acceleratingtitling of individualplots, enforcing collaterallegislation,and promotingsmall
credit associations. The Bank has helped to strengthen the operation of the irrigation
system and to reduce leakage, and further support is envisaged in the proposed Irrigation
Development Credit (FY03). The Bank would -- in close collaboration with the EU --

include support for decompression of tariffs and the development of water users
associations. This would help meet the new cost-recovery targets to be defined in the
forthcoming Medium-TermExpenditure Program. The Bank has also been helping raise
small farmers' productivity through finance for better support services, easier title
registration, and better access to credit (credit access is also being improved for mediumscale agro-businesses).
48.
Environmentand NaturalResourceManagement.The Bank's planned NaturalResourceManagementand PovertyAlleviationCreditlGEFGrant(FY02) would help reduce
rural poverty and natural resource degradation by supporting: participatory watershed
management and community development,environmentallysustainable farming activities,
and improved forest and protected area management. Through direct community involvement the project will integrate biodiversity conservation into sustainable natural resources
management. The Urban Heat Credit (FY04) would also help reduce consumption of
polluting and scarce fuels, specifically if zero-polluting geothermal resources could substitute for fossil fuels. The Bank is also completing work on an Integrated Water
Resources Management Plan (FYO1) based on sustainable and rational utilization,
protection, conservation and management of water resources. It will be important to
monitor the cross-sectoral impact of reforms, including the inter-relationship between
energy sector reforms and trends in fuel-wood consumption (and thus deforestation and
indoor pollution). Also important will be continued support for improved environmental
policy, institutional strengthening, building public-private partnership for environmental
protectionand compliance with internationalcommitments. The Bank will consider future
assistance to help the Government introduce new incentive structures and regulatory and
financial instruments for environmental management, and may also support efforts to
mainstream the environment and incorporate global environmental concerns in transport,
agriculture, and energy sectors by promoting development of non-traditional energy
sources.
C. Rebuilding Human Capital
49.
PRSP Focus. The I-PRSP stressesthat it is critical to expand budget allocations to
the social sectors, and to push forward with a comprehensiverationalization of existing
facilities, better training and re-training, more focus on results and on using output
indicators, and greater focus on preventative health, housing conditions, indoor pollution
and water and sanitation. The Bank's support will focus on:
* Education. The Bank has been supporting more prioritized, efficient and stable
financing for general primary and secondary education, including increased
budgetary allocations for general education, sustainable textbook supply, and a
greater community involvement in schools. Teaching quality is being addressed
through improvements in the curriculum,teacher assessment and examination, and
better access to modern technologies,including informationtechnologiesand more
relevant textbooks. School budgets are to be made more transparent and more
poverty-focused, with budgets and other relevant documents being made public.
The Government is tackling lack of access of the poor to schooling through free
textbook loans and other targeted initiatives. The Government still faces major

-20-

challenges in combining underutilized schools, and addressing the poor quality of
education, and the proposed Second Education Credit (FY04) would likely focus
on these continuing challenges.
* Health. The Bank has been supporting better access to health services,particularly
for poorer groups and regions, reallocation of the health budget towards primary
health care, concentration of funding on core services, improved financing of the
health system, and health service rationalization,including closing excess capacity.
The Bank will continue to support the Government in developing appropriate
strategies and mechanisms for achieving the above-mentioned goals, as well as
follow-on project funding. The Bank is also helping the Government develop a
comprehensive HIV/AIDS strategy, that could be supported under the possible
Health/SocialProtection Credit (FY04), which would also deepen the health and
social protectionreforms being implementedin the first health sector credit.
* Social Protection and Labor Markets. Social protection continues to be a key
concern. Social insurance is crucial to protect the elderly against extreme poverty.
A SocialProtection Study (FY02) would contributeto the design and implementation of fiscally sustainable public pensions reform. In the area of social safety nets
the Bank expects to continue to support better targeting and administration of the
family poverty benefit, since it is one of the key poverty coping/alleviationinstruments. The main objective in the medium term is to rationalize social insurance.
The Bank will also help develop Armenia's legal framework, institutions and
policies for social protection, and especially community-basedsocial assistance and
care services for the most vulnerable. In the area of employment the Bank's
support for flexible and broader labor markets is expected through policy reforms
in labor legislation and institutions, and modest, affordable public protection for
unemployment. Support in some of these areas is possible through the
Health/Social Protection Credit (FY04), as well as future adjustment program
supportedby SAC V (FY03).
G
Gender
Issues. Women's earnings are a crucial component of household income,
and the implications for economic and social development will be addressed in the
SocialProtection and Labor Market Studies (FY02 and FY03), and in the design
of the Household Survey. The Bank's second Social Investment Fund Credit
(FY00) has a particular focus on gender issues, including support for: evaluation of
the project's impact on women, as well as mitigatory steps where needed;
strengthening the active participation of women in development activities; and
collectionof gender disaggregateddata for evaluation and future project purposes.
* Community-DrivenDevelopment. Armenia pioneered social investmentfunds in
ECA, though the internal and external shocks have made it more difficult to reap
large-scale benefits from this work to date. The Bank will continue to support
appropriate scaling-up of community-driven development by expanding community access to information on Bank-assisted projects -- for example the planned
Natural Resource Management and Poverty Reduction Credit/Grant(FY02) -and promotingcommunities' systematicinvolvementin design, implementationand
monitoring of watershed management. The Urban Heating Credit (FY04) could,
as mentioned above, focus on community ownership of heating services. The
Bank's community-driven development approach -- which the Bank is working
with Armenian stakeholders to develop -- will have important implications for the
ongoing second Social Investment Fund Credit, education and health sector
reforms, natural resource management, and planned anti-corruptionprograms.

X. The World Bank's Business Strategy
50.
World Bank Portfolio. Following the closure of three credits in the first three
quarters of FY01, the World Bank's portfolio now consists of thirteen credits totaling $261
million. Recent portfolio performance has been good (see Attachment 1 and Annex 8),
although there have been some systemic problems, especially procurement delays,
counterpartfunding arrears, and delays in parliamentaryapproval of grants.
*

Counterpart funds are sometimes insufficient - four projects are currently rated
unsatisfactoryfor counterpartfunding.

* Parliamentary ratification for PHRD/IDF/GEFGrants has often been slow, and at

one point in FY00 thirteen Grants totaling almost $5 million were pending.
* Procurement is often delayed by problems with tender evaluation, and by delays in

award of contracts and handling of procurementcomplaints.
Following an intensive portfolio review in early 2000 the Governmenthas been addressing
these issues. Counterpart backlogs are being cleared, a comprehensive Law on
International Treaties has streamlined grant ratification, and procurement delays are now
significantly less than they were in FY00. To improve responsiveness and day-to-day
oversight of the portfolio, the Bank has devolved authority for portfolio management to
Yerevan, and is working to streamline and improve project audits. In addition, the Bank
intends to place in Tbilisi an International Financial Management Specialist covering the
three Caucasus countries.
51.
IDA Base Case Assistance Program. Annenia is currently in the Base Case,
which assumes continued good policy reform performance. Lending is envisaged to be
US$150 million (see Table 3), which is consistent with the IDA Lending Allocation. The
Base Case includes three projects a year (four in FY04) -- including SAC V in FY03.
There are few other donors providing development assistance, so the lending program
covers a relatively wide spectrum (other donors are mostly involved in technical assistance

and humanitarian relief), covering structural reform, the social sectors, sustainable rural
development,governance, private sector development and urban utilities. Nonetheless, as
indicated in Table 3, most of the proposed credits follow up on earlier successful
operations, so the risks of a relatively diverse portfolio are substantially reduced. Given
the work program and intentions of other donors (see Attachment 2), we envisageno direct
support for culture, tourism, housing, mining, telecommunications or aviation infrastructure,although the two latter areas are possibilities for IFC investment.
52.
IDA Base Case Triggers. For Armenia to remain in the Base Case progress would
be needed on all the triggers shown in Box 5. The triggers focus on satisfactory development and implementationof: (i) the macroeconomicprogram, as evidenced for example by
implementationof the Poverty Reduction and Growth Program; (ii) the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP); (iii) the reform program, including measures to improve social
service delivery and the business climate (with a tangible reduction in corruption and
governmentinterference in private sector activity); and (iv) the IDA-financed projects.
High-Base Case Triggers and Assistance. Should the Government accelerate its
53.
reform program, particularly in the areas of energy reform and privatization, the Bank
could consider bringing SAC V forward to FY02, and extending its scope to include
further strengthening of reforms in the energy sector. Under these circumstances, a PRSC
of US$40 million could be added in FY04, bringing total lending up to US$190 million.
With good performance, IDA partial risk guarantees for privatizations and for new exportoriented investments could be considered,in addition to the US$150-190 million envelope.

Box 5: Base Case Triggers
Base Case assistance would be conditined on progress in all of the following areas:
Overall Development/PovertyReduction
* Developmentand implementation ofthe PRSP

structure and financing issues, including progress in phasing out Government involvement in the
provision of district heat, and in imposition of a hard budget constraint on heat providers.

-23-

54.

Low Case Triggers and Assistance. If there is little progress on any of the Base

Case triggers, Armenia would move to the Low Case. In the Low Case, the focus is
expected to be largely on projects in human development, rural development, and
environment that can contribute to long-term poverty alleviation even with poor
governance, or for capacity building. No lending is envisaged for private sector development, or energy. Also in the Low Case there would be no adjustment lending. Total IDA
lendingwould then be about US$80 million.
55.
Outcome Indicators. Well-designed and monitored outcome indicators will be
crucial to judging the success of the poverty reduction strategy. Box 6 gives the mediumterm outcome indicators to be monitored over the CAS period. Longer-termindicators are
being developed in the context of the PRSP (see Attachment 3 and Annex 9, drawing on
the I-PRSP. The Bank will work with the Governmentand civil society to further develop
these indicators, and to create monitoring procedures at the community, district and
national levels. Where feasible, the Bank will try and ensure that the indicators and
monitoring mechanisms capture the social impacts of anti-povertymeasures, and that the

indicators are regularly published and disseminated throughout Armenia. The Bank will
also work with communities,local governments and civil society organizationsto develop
a "social audit" of Governmentprograms and policies.
56.
Work Program. The Bank's work program -- including supervision and nonlending services -- is summarizedin Table 4. The due diligence economicand sector work
will be addressed through the PER/CFAA (FY02), a Poverty Study (FY02), a
CEM/GrowthStudy (FYO1),an Institutionaland GovernanceReform Study (FYO1),and a
ProcurementAssessment (FY02). An informal Client Survey was undertaken in FYOO,in
preparation for the CAS, and a Client Survey will also be undertaken in FY02 and later
years as necessary.

which included an open and very substantive dialogue with the private sector and NGOs
on a range of institutional and economic issues (Box 4). The donors have been closely
involved in the development of this CAS. The Bank expects to co-chair a Consultative
Group Meetingin Paris in July, 2001.
58.
Civil Society. Most of the Bank's consultation will continue to be directed towards
supportingthe Government'sparticipatory process for the PRSP. The main goal will be to
help "internalize"PRSP participation process within the Armenian Government and civil
society, and in that sense the role of the Bank will become more advisory. Leading roles
are being played by USAID, EU/TACIS, the Lincy Foundation and other international
NGOs in supporting the evolution of local NGOs, strengthen Parliamentaryprocesses, the
press and other democratic institutions.

XI. Managing the Risks
59.
Geo-Political Instability. The CAS faces several political and economic risks.
The Caucasus have historically been a region buffeted by competing political forces. In
the event of renewed conflict, the Bank would endeavor to focus on the most povertyoriented investments, but a temporary cessation of new lending, and perhaps even
disbursements,might be unavoidable,and the Board would be updated in this event. On
the other hand, there are prospects for a peace agreement on Nagorno-Karabakh. In this
case, we would update the Board on proposed Bank support for post-conflict
reconstructionand development.
60.

OtherRisks. The CAS faces a number of other risks.
- Governance. The Bank's strategy relies on judicial and public administration
reform (and deregulation) as the best way to help reduce corruption and improve
the quality of government services. There is a possibility that the reformn
momentumin these areas will be affected by political changes, and in this event we
would need to reassess our strategy, possibly placing more emphasis on nonlending services.
* Population. A new census is planned, which may reveal a much lower population,

with a resulting risk of reduced assistance from donors. The Governmentneeds to
plan ahead for this eventuality, and the Bank will work with the authorities to
ensure that the MTEF and PRSP include a downside risk scenario of reduced donor
assistance.
. Business Environment. The Poverty Reduction Strategy relies on the
Government's commitmentto move rapidly to support a level playing field for the
private sector, thus encouraging employment-creatinginvestments. There is a risk
that this commitment may be derailed by interest groups that benefit from the
existing business environment of limited competition and high effective barriers to
new entry. If this were to happen, the Bank would need to postpone its planned
support for private sector investment,and reconsider its adjustmentlending.
* Debt Sustainability. Any of the these risks mentioned above could move Armenia
toward the downside macroeconomic scenario outlined in paragraph 30 above, in
which the debt burden becomes unsustainable relative to exports and/or revenues.
Key factors in determining whether the downside risk scenario is realized are

-26-

overall economic growth, the level of exports-orientedinvestment, and the grant
element of new development assistance. This reinforces the importance for the
Bank of supporting reforms which foster private investments, particularly exportoriented investments, and which improve the tax base and tax collection. It also
underlines the importance of the Bank continuing to help the Government manage
and coordinateexternal assistance.
61.
Minimizing the Risks. The Bank will try to minimize these risks to the CAS by
working closely with Government, civil society, the domestic and foreign private sector,
and donors to ensure that reformnot only gains momentum,but is owned and supported by
all the key constituencies necessary for Armenia to succeed in its poverty reduction
strategy.

PORTFOLIO
