EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Indonesia is striving to emergefrom a severe economic crisis, complete its transition to a
democratic society, and embark on an ambitious program of decentralization. Each one of these
challenges would test any country. Together, they constitute a highly complex agenda for
Indonesia. Yet, Indonesia's move to democracy and decentralization also hold its only promise
of building the institutions necessary for sustainable growth and development. The future for
Indonesia, therefore, holds enormous opportunities,but also immense risk. The stakes are highnot just for Indonesia but also for the international community. This mix of opportunity and risk
forms the recurrent background theme to this Country Assistance Strategy for the World Bank
Group.
ii.
The new Government of President Wahid inherited an economy with deep structural
flaws, weak institutions, and an entrenched bureaucracy. Corruption is still rampant and infects
the very institutions (the police and judiciary) that are supposed to tackle it. Regional unrest,
growing nationalism, and political and ethnic tensions threaten national unity and continue to
preoccupy the Government. Poor implementation of the far-reaching decentralization program
may threaten fiscal stability and disrupt the delivery of public services. Investors remain wary of
political uncertainty, the weak legal and judicial system, and uneven policy implementation.
iii.
Yet the very process of political transition and decentralization, while creating acute
uncertainties in the short term, also provides Indonesia greater hopefor sustainableprogress on
poverty reduction in the long term. There is now much more open debate in Indonesia over key
development issues such as debt, corruption and the participationof civil society in public policy
formulation. Greater transparency in politics and government is building pressure for reform. A
free press keeps a watchful eye on the political process and on the courts. If properly managed,
decentralization can help build local democratic institutions and give people greater control over
their lives.
iv.
The Bank Group sees Indonesia's future with excitement-and concern. In a
democratizing and decentralizing political and economic system, the opportunities for
sustainable development are immense, but so are the risks and constraints. Despite the Bank's
association with the past, the new Government still sees the Bank Group as an important
development partner going forward-and has asked for an expanded International Development
Association (IDA) program. And despite reduced lending levels, the Bank plays an influential
role in key policy areas of the economic recovery program-in close association with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Many other donor
agencies are committed to supporting Indonesia, and the Bank has developed close partnerships
with them across a broad spectrum of development priorities.
v.
This CAS has also been informed by public consultations with civil society
organizations. They expressed serious concern with high levels of debt and corruption. They
recommended the Bank to focus on poverty reduction through "bottom-up" community
development, and to involve civil society more actively in future programs. The private sector
strategy (distributed along with the CAS) also benefited from consultations with private sector
representatives. They pointed out the main weaknesses in the current investment climate in
Indonesia, which are holding back recovery and job creation for the poor.

- ii -

vi.
The overarchinggoal of the World Bank Group in Indonesia will be to support efforts to
reduce poverty and vulnerability in a more democratic and decentralized environment. The
number of poor has fallen from crisis levels, but half of all Indonesians remain vulnerable to
poverty. Accordingly, the Bank Group's strategy will focus on the following three broad priority
areas:
* Sustaining economic recovery and promoting broad-based growth. In the short run, this
requires macroeconomic stability and accelerated bank and corporate restructuring. In the
medium term, it will involve policies and public expenditures aimed at poverty reduction,
efficient private sector growth, and human capital and infrastructure development to improve
competitiveness;
* Building national institutionsfor accountablegovernment, which includes legal and judicial
reforms, civil service reforms, better public financial management and procurement, effective
decentralization, and close attention to sustainable management of the rapidly depleting
natural resource base of the country; and
X

Delivering better public services to the poor, which involves assistance to help define
government roles and responsibilities as functions are decentralized, support for improved
public service delivery by sub-national governmentswhich have demonstrated pro-poor, progrowth reform, as well as promoting community development and selective assistance to
post-conflict areas.

vii.
The "base case "-considered to be the most likely scenario-presumes the current
"muddle-through" situation will continue, with some slippage in structural reforms, but with
continued macroeconomic stability that would help sustain poverty reduction. This is not a
desirable scenario, providing a fragile foundation for external support to Indonesia, and even
harbors risks to the Bank's portfolio as fiduciary standards may slip in a decentralized system. At
the same time, the Bank is one of Indonesia's long-term development partners and cannot
disassociate itself from this fledgling democracy. The CAS base case program is expected to be
robust to most downside risks, while at the same time positioning the Bank for possible upside
opportunities. Minimum conditions for the base case would be maintenance of macroeconomic
stability, including prudent debt management and progress on asset sales and privatization,
minimum fiduciary safeguards for delivery of public services with decentralization, and
establishment of organizational arrangements, scope, process, and schedule for developing a
broad-based poverty reduction strategy. The key elements for fiscal years (FY) 01-03 are as
follows:
* The Bank's portfolio will continue to shrink and stabilize around 50 to 55 projects by FY03.
Portfolio management will focus on continued quality improvement and further
strengthening of fiduciary controls. The Bank will also step up its support of government
efforts to strengthen procurement and financial management, which is at risk of deterioration
as public service delivery is decentralized.
* The Bank's Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) program will continue to emphasize
advisory services, supported by a small but growing body of analytical work, and increased
attention to regional issues. This will include its leading role in bank and corporate

- iii

-

restructuring and sectoral reforms. The balance of AAA work will shift from crisis response
to longer-term development concerns over the CAS period. The Bank will continue
assistance in development and implementation of Government's broad-based poverty
strategy.
*

A core Bank lending program of up to $400 million a year-less than one third of pre-crisis
levels (around $1.3 billion a year during FY90-97). The average IBRD/IDA blend would be
65:35 over the CAS period. This is consistent with Indonesia's current IDA-12 allocation.
IBRD exposure would be reduced from $11.8 billion at the end of FY00 to $10.7 billion by
the end of FY03.

* The lending program will focus on projects supporting social services and basic
infrastructurefor the poor, working increasingly with local governments and communities in
regions where the leadership supports open and accountable government, promotes growth,
and adopts pro-poor policies. No adjustment lending is foreseen in the base case.
viii. The high case signals the Bank's willingness to provide more support if policy
performance improves. If reforms accelerate, and in line with the Government's request, the
CAS foresees raising lending to about $1 billion a year from FY02. This would include a
temporary increase in access to IDA resources, as discussed with the IDA Deputies in Lisbon.
There could also be a small amount of adjustment lending, if needed. The program anticipates a
move toward programmatic lending in support of governance and sectoral programs as capacity
and fiduciary controls improve at the sub-national level. Key up-front actions include: prudent
monetary, fiscal and debt management; accelerated bank and corporate restructuring and
privatization; agreement on a policy framework for rice; progress on agreed actions to reform
procurement and financial management systems; and initial steps on preparation of a broadbased poverty reduction strategy. Regular semiannual policy assessments will be made to
determine continued eligibility for the high case and to set performance targets for the next six
months.
ix.
Unfortunately, there is also a significantpossibility of a crisis scenario. A breakdown in
the Government's Extended Arrangement with the IMF as a result of major policy slippage,
including inadequate progress on bank and corporate restructuring, could lead to a rapid erosion
of market confidence and deterioration in economic conditions. A similar outcome could result
from political instability or a widespreadbreakdown in law and order. In such adverse situations,
the Bank would cease all new lending but undertake more crisis-related AAA work. In the event
of another macroeconomic shock, the Bank may be asked to contribute to an internationalrescue
effort. But the Bank's response this time around will be limited by the Government's high debt
burden and risks associated with IBRD's high exposure to Indonesia.
x.
The CAS also outlines the current plans of IFC and MIGA in Indonesia, and how they fit
into the overall Bank Group strategy. The recently prepared private sector strategy, together with
joint management of Bank and IFC private sector activities, allow for considerable synergies
between the Bank Group's policy and transactions work (e.g., on SMEs), while carefully
managing potential conflicts of interest. Beyond the restructuring of its existing clients, IFC will
focus on interventions with strong demonstration effects and positive impact on market
perceptions. It will also support SME development, resource-based industries and private

- iv -

participation in infrastructure. MIGA has suspendedits guarantee activities in Indonesia, pending
settlement of an outstanding claim by the Government.
xi.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:

*

Is the assistance program responsive to Indonesia's major development challenges?

*

Is the Bank Group's response appropriate for an important partner country going through a
major political and economic transition?

* Do the lending scenarios, including a relatively small, poverty-focused base case program,
the proposed lending triggers and increased IDA in the high case, and a possible crisis
scenario, respond well to the country conditions?
* Are the partnership arrangementsand proposed AAA appropriate?
* Have the risks been appropriatelyidentified and addressed?

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT,
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
FOR INDONESIA

1.

COUNTRY CONTEXT
POLITICALTRANSITION

1.
Indonesia is in the midst of a major political transition toward a democratic society.
The country held its first free and open elections since the 1950s in June 1999. Moderate Muslim
leader Abdurrahman Wahid emerged as the new President from a multiparty post-election
negotiation process-overtaking Megawati Sukamoputri who became Vice-President after her
party had won a plurality of seats in the legislature. Much has been achieved in the first year of
the Wahid government. It has begun to restore democratic freedoms and civil rights and tackle
the tough issue of the role of the military in politics. The new parliament ceded independence to
East Timor in November 1999. The Government has started a dialogue with a number of regions
pressing for greater autonomy. Preparations are under way for a major program of
decentralization-due to go into effect in January 2001, designed to reverse the extreme
centralization of government in Jakarta. Parliament is no longer a rubber stamp, there is a lively
and free press, an increasingly vocal and active civil society, and a growing free trade union
movement. The forthcoming regional autonomy makes local governments increasingly active,
and local legislatures are starting to control their executivebranches.
2.
But the transition is beset with tensions and uncertainty. The initial governing
coalition did not hold and a new more unified cabinet was announced following the annual
August session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). But the President has a tenuous
relationship with Parliament-as reflected by two recent attempts at his impeachment-which
affects Government's ability to maintain the momentum of reform. The military retains a
political role, albeit a limited one, and a constitutional amendment has reduced chances of them
being prosecuted for past wrongdoings. Public impatience and cynicism are being fed by
inefficient law enforcement and the slow prosecution of corruption cases, stymied by an
entrenched and corrupt bureaucracy, police and judiciary. The new freedoms have brought to the
surface long suppressed ethnic divisions, a deterioration in law and order, and communal
violence, particularly in Maluku. Secessionist movements have become increasingly active in
Aceh and Irian Jaya. While greater autonomy is contemplated for these regions, tensions have
mounted as local aspirations for self-rule are met by determination of the central government and
military to maintain Indonesia's territorial integrity. These issues have absorbed most of the
Government's energy, leaving policymakers little time for developing policy and strategy.
3.
And the far-reaching decentralization program will have major implications.
Decentralization is a strong political imperative to counter the centrifugal forces within the
country. It also makes good economic sense, as Indonesia is unusually centralized for a country

2

of its size and diversity. But if managed badly, the transition to a decentralized Indonesia could
not only derail macroeconomic stability, but also seriously affect the delivery of government
services. And with implementation scheduled to start in January 2001, much needs to be worked
out (see Box 1.1 for main features of the decentralizationprogram).
Box 1.1:MainFeaturesof the Decentralization
Program
Administrative aspects: Law 22 of 1999 devolves most functions of government to Indonesia's regions-28
provinces and over 350 districts and cities. The key exceptions are national defense, international relations, justice,
police, monetary, development planning, religion, and finance. The districts must perform important functions,
including health, education, environmentaland infrastructureservices. The province has only a minor role, mainly in
coordination, and backstopping districts and cities that cannot yet perform their functions-which may be an
opening for an expanded provincial role. The province will also continue to perform deconcentrated central tasks.
Implementing regulations further specify the remaining roles of the central and provincial governments, including
setting standards for service delivery. The central government can annul regional bylaws and regulations that
conflict with national laws and regulations, but the regions can appeal to the supreme court against the center's
decision. The intergovernmental regional autonomy advisory board with representatives from the center and the
regions is to advise the President on issues concerning decentralization.
Fiscal aspects: The legal framework (Laws 22 and 25 of 1999) will drastically increase the regional share of general
government spending. Preliminary estimates suggest that when decentralization is fully implemented, the regions
will spend some 8 to 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), or well over 40 percent of general government
spending, and over double what they spend now. The bulk of this will be controlled by the districts and cities. The
center will share some of the resource revenues with the regions-for 2001 amounting to some 1.3 percent of
GDP-but this will only benefit a few regions with natural resources.
For most regions, the general grant will be the main source of revenues. This grant will be a rninimum of 25 percent
of central government revenues-some 4 percent of GDP for 2001. The general grant will be distributed by a
formula that has some equalizing elements, but guarantees a grant at least equal to the recurrent and development
grants received in the past-irrespective of other income. The equalization formula does not adequately consider
expenditure needs for minimal service provision and thus, poorer regions could be shortchanged. Furthermore, the
center can grant special grants but the amounts are small given the current budget envirommentand their allocation
has been given little attention so far.
Regional governments will also be allowed to borrow, but borrowing will be limited by a formula for total debt, by
individual Ministry of Finance (MOF) approval for foreign loans, but without the guarantee of central government.
The Government can put further limits on regional borrowing, and plans to prohibit regional borrowing for FY2001,
except from the central government. Bank and other donor lending to the regions will for now be able to make use
of an existing onlending mechanism.
Government has issued regulations on financial management and procurement of the regions. These regulations
would allow the regions to largely deterrnine their own financial management, accounting, and procurement system
within (broad) guidelines from the central government. This arrangement risks a weakening of the country's
fiduciary environment, and a fragmentation of the market for government procurement, as local procurement
regulations could favor local suppliers.
To strengthen local own revenue sources the Government has revised the Law 18 of 1997 on regional taxes and
levies. The revised law allows regions to establish taxes as long as they obey certain principles. While these
principles are sound, the weak monitoring and enforcement capacity of the center risks a return to the pre- 1997 days
in which local taxes became a serious barrier for internal trade.

FRAGILEECONOMICRECOVERY

4.
The nascent recovery from the crisis gained strength during the past year.
Indonesia's economy fared better than expected at the time of the CAS Progress Report. Growth

3
rebounded earlier than expected, and inflation came down more rapidly, and the country
generated a higher than expected current account surplus (see Table 1.1). GDP growth in 2000 is
expected to be in the 4-5 percent range. The recovery is becoming broader based, with
investment growth overtaking consumption as a leading contributor. Exports are still growing
rapidly, benefiting from the strong depreciation of the Rupiah and buoyant world trade.
Encouragingly,non-oil exports did particularly well. Inflation, although accelerating somewhat,
remains under control (see Figure 1.1).

5.
But Indonesia's recovering economy was not reflected in improved financial
markets. The Rupiah exchange rate has continued to see wild gyrations over the last year. The
capital markets fared little better. The Jakarta stock exchange drifted off its post-crisis peaks in
October 1999, and one year later had dropped by 30 percent. Similarly, Indonesia's risk premium
in international markets reversed its decline, and spreads on Indonesian US dollar denominated
bonds are now more than 700 basis points over US treasury bonds. In contrast with other
recovering Asian countries, private capital outflow continues. FY99/00 saw a $9 billion net
private capital outflow from Indonesia, of which $4 billion was foreign direct investment (FDI)
outflow.
6.
Bank and corporate restructuringneeds to be accelerated, because without new credit
or investment the recovery will run out of steam. There is some promising progress: the first
stage of bank recapitalization has been completed, non-performing loans are falling, new lending
has resumed, albeit hesitantly, and a return to bank profitability is near. The Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency's (IBRA's) governance has improved, and its recovery operations have
started in earnest. Voluntary settlements on debt through the Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF)
and between debtors and creditors have started to pick up. To nurture these tenuous beginnings,
Government must complete bank recapitalization while continuing to restructure state banks,
strengthen the banks' governance, develop a credit culture, and upgrade risk controls and
systems. IBRA asset disposition should be accelerated within a transparent and competitive
process to maximize returns, and minimize opportunities for corruption. And legal, regulatory
and tax impediments against restructuring should be removed. Over time, Government needs to
develop and implement a medium-term strategy to strengthen the entire financial sector. High on
this agenda is the privatization of state banks.

7.
And Government faces a major challenge in maintaining fiscal sustainability. The
crisis left the Government deeply in debt. After completing bank recapitalization, government
debt will add up to a towering 100 percent of GDP, up from 23 percent of GDP before the crisis.
And debt service, together with politically sensitive fuel subsidies and the wage bill take up more
than four-fifths of government revenues. This puts severe pressure on the budget, and threatens
to crowd out development spending. This pressure could well increase with the onset of
decentralization next year. Reducing it will involve tough policy choices to raise revenues
through better tax administration, phase out inefficient subsidies while protecting the poorest,
improve fiscal management, and accelerateprivatization and asset recovery.
POVERTYCONTINUESTO BE A CENTRALISSUE

8.
While poverty rose sharply in the crisis, the recovery has been decidedly pro-poor.
The crisis dramatically illustrated how much economic growth and stability matter to Indonesia's
poor. In the two decades leading up to 1996 poverty levels fell from over 60 percent to less than
12 percent of the population,' though many hovered just above the poverty line and remained
vulnerable to shocks. So when the economic crisis hit in 1997 following two drought years, and
per capita GNP was halved to US$580,2 the expenditurepoverty rate shot up-at least doubling
from its pre-crisis low (in August 1997) to the peak 27 percent3 in late 1998/early 1999.
Indications are that poverty has since fallen substantially from the crisis peak, helped by
increasing real wages and improving employment, and the sharp decline in food pricesespecially rice. Box 1.2 provides a profile of the poor and vulnerable in 1999.
9.
But despite crisis recovery, various dimensions of poverty still affect half of all
Indonesians. Despite the good news on reductions in expenditure poverty from its crisis peak,
Indonesians face startlingly high vulnerability to poverty. The Bank's recent poverty report4
shows that over a three-year period between 30 to 60 percent of all Indonesians face a greater
than 50-50 chance of periodically experiencing extreme poverty. And poverty takes many forms
in addition to material poverty (those living in households with expenditures below the poverty
line). Lack of access to basic education and adequatenutrition or of recourse to medical services
makes people poor, as do inadequate or nonexistent basic infrastructure (safe water, adequate
sanitation, transport and roads, electricity). People who are excluded from social community life
or discriminated against experience yet another form of poverty. Important gender differences
persist (see Box 1.3). When poverty is expanded to include all these dimensions of vulnerability
and human well-being, then poverty in Indonesia is still an issue that concerns about half the
population. Tackling poverty therefore will require that all policies, expenditures and programs
are evaluated for their impact on the livelihoods of those strugglingto escape poverty or who risk

The calculation method used by BPS, which also adopts a new poverty line to better match current consumption
patterns (i.e., different from the national poverty line used in 1995),results in a lower estimate for the portion of
the population living in poverty in February 1999 (23.5 percent).

GOVERNANCE
IS THEWEAKLINK
10.

Governance

is Indonesia's

development

challenge.

Weak

governance has, if not caused, at least aggravated the economic crisis out of which Indonesia is
just emerging. The crisis brought to the surface the lack of accountability, transparency and rule
of law in Indonesia, compounded by weak institutions unresponsive to the population at large,
and the poor in particular. Indonesia scores consistently low in surveys on rule of law,
corruption, and business environment. Illegal gains from corruption have mainly benefited the
rich, and were a major factor in the downfall of the Suharto regime. Bad governance has affected
the poor across the board, from lack of basic law and order, lack of mechanisms to influence
budgetary choices, poor quality of services, and lack of transparency and accountability in the
use of funds.
11.

The task of governance reform is huge. The judiciary, civil service, government

financial management, and the role of the state all affect governance. Under the New Order, the
judiciary functioned largely as an instrument of the executive. The court system, from the judges
down, was fundamentally corrupt, while prosecutors were considered facilitators of extortion and
bribery. The lack of performance monitoring and sanctions on non-performing judges, lack of
transparency of judgments, and absence of systemicjurisprudence all contribute to the perceived
absence of rule of law. The slow process in corporate restructuring can at least partly be
attributed to the questionable judicial process. The civil service suffers from the same lack of
transparency, accountability and performance. Corruption has been widespread. It delivered top-

Box 1.3: Gender Inequalities Persist in Indonesian Society...
.

Female illiteracy is still considerably higher than male (20 percent and 9 percent) although the gap has
narrowed considerably and primary and junior secondary enrollments are nearly gender balanced. Still,
stereotypical gender roles are reinforced through school books and the curriculum.

.

As for jobs, women are concentrated in low-skill, low-paid employment-71 percent of workers officially
recorded as "unpaid family workers" are women, and only 7 percent of the senior administrators and managers
are women. Home based workers and those working overseas, both predominantly women, are deprived of
basic rights, benefits, or job security, and wages are usually extremely low.

.

Women are heavily underrepresented in public life-Parliament has only 10 percent women; women make up
35 percent of civil servants, but only 4 percent are in the highest two echelons; and just 2 percent of village
heads are women.

.

Women are often victims of violent crime (including State violence)-rape, harassment, or domestic violence,
although the real incidence of these crimes is still unknown.

But these statistics do not give the full story. The inequalities are more deeply embedded and have been
institutionalized.The main issue facing women in Indonesia is one of visibility and voice. Although the Constitution
gives equal rights to women, successive state policy documents have defined separate roles for men and women:
men as the heads of households and women as mothers and caretakers. And there is a concem that decentralization
may reverse Government's attention to gender issues.

down services to the public, which are now out of step with the new democratic realities. And
decentralization will create a further challenge as up to 2.7 million civil servants will have to be
reassigned, with major risks of disruptions in service delivery. The lack of sound financial
management and procurement systems have contributed to the weak traditions of accountability
in the public sector. There is no properly functioning system of checks and balances, and lack of
transparency makes external performance monitoring virtually impossible. The forthcoming
decentralization is likely to make things worse rather than better in the short run as there is little
evidence that regional governments will have in place adequate fiduciary controls on local
spending.
12.
Weak corporate governance affects the private sector. Investor surveys show that
Indonesia has among the worst corporate governance in East Asian countries. There is a lack of
transparency and financial disclosure, accounting and auditing systems are weak, rights of
minority investors are insufficient, and interlocking ownership between banks and corporates
have contributed to the collapse of the bank and corporate sector during the crisis. Lack of
transparency and weak regulatory frameworks also continue to impede private investment in
infrastructure and other public services.
POLICYRESPONSE
HAS BEENUNEVEN
13.
Market confidence is affected by weak policy performance. President Wahid's first
administration was quick to commit to reforms in January 2000 as part of its new three-year

8

SDR 3.6 billion Extended Arrangement with the IMF, supported by the World Bank and ADB.s
But implementation of agreed reforms has been slow. Among others, the Government hesitated
on actions to accelerate bank and corporate restructuring, postponed the fuel price increases and
phase-out of tax exemptions, and reversed its stance on rice and import tariffs. Foreign investors
were further taken aback by policy decisions to restrict foreign investment in a number of
sectors. These decisions have since been reversed but at the expense of investor confidence.
14.
Government's medium-term policy directions emphasize the importance of
improved governance and addressing social inequity and poverty as part of a sustainable
and just economic recovery. The State Policy Guidelines, adopted by the MPR after the June
1999 general elections, underline the supremacy of law and the protection of fundamental human
rights. It promotes the development of a "people's economy" relying on fair market mechanisms
and "empowering" small- and medium-size entrepreneurs and cooperatives linked to improved
people's welfare through access to basic needs, thus moving away from the strong central
authority and monopolistic business practices enjoyed by a privileged set of cronies in the
Suharto era. Rather than the earlier top-down approaches, the intent is to empower communities
as main agents of development. The Government's Propenas five-year plan (GOI FY2001-05)
builds on these guidelines and is organized around five major priority areas: (1) building a
democratic political system while maintaining national unity; (2) realizing the supremacy of law
and clean governance; (3) accelerating economic recovery and building a sustainable and just
development platforn; (4) improving the development of people's welfare and cultural
resilience, and (5) improving regional development.President Wahid underlined these principles
in his MPR accountability speech in August 2000.
15.
Building on these principles,
the new Cabinet has started to put in
place its economic recovery program.

than a plan, and much effort is required to underpin the objectives with a strategy and-more
importantly-to take those actions that lend credibility to the program. In the short run, two
issues are crucial to accelerating the recovery: intensifying bank and corporate restructuring, and
maintaining fiscal sustainability. In the medium term, Governmentfaces two critical issues. First,
it must shift the focus of poverty reduction efforts from crisis response social safety nets to a
broad-basedstrategy for attacking poverty and vulnerability in Indonesia. Second, to consolidate
democracy, and to set the conditions for sustainable growth, it must change the way Indonesia is
governed.
16.
The Government has also initiated steps to develop a comprehensive poverty
reduction strategy. Based on the

17.
But it needs to follow-up with implementationsuited to local government control of
service delivery. The Government will need to follow-through quickly on its ambitious plans to
coordinate poverty programs and monitoring, and expand its CGI statement into a poverty
strategy with broad-based buy-in from regional governments and civil society. Social sector
spending shortfalls were pronounced during the crisis, while inefficient fuel subsidies increased
their share dramatically and remain greater than the entire development budget in the draft 2001
budget. To make matters worse, recent funding for basic infrastructure and maintenance has been
woefully inadequate-undermining Government's poverty efforts. Going forward toward
decentralized public service delivery-when over 350 local governments will take charge of
planning, budgeting and implementation-the central government will need to redefine its role to
keep a national focus on poverty reduction, including a fiscal transfer framework that allows for
rewards to sub-national reformers-those that are actively accountable and pro-poor-and
targeted support to communities so that those with weaker governments are not left behind. The

10

central government will also need to revitalize monitoring, agree with regions on minimum
service standards and poverty reduction goals, and support ways for local governments to learn
from each other so that growth and development are broad-based. Once Government
organizational arrangements for developing a broad-based poverty strategy (para. 16) are in
place, the Bank will review with Government the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy
paper (PRSP) to be completed in FY02.
18.
Similarly on governance and anticorruption, the initial steps have been tentative
and insufficient. While the State Policy Guidelines call for a comprehensive reform program
embracing the judiciary, civil service, corporate governance and reform at all levels of
government, commitment to reform is at best uneven, and at worst weak, and hence the reform
process in this area suffers from lack of coherent management, coordination and leadership. Yet
public demands for reform are strong and its impatience is growing. The Government's
credibility is increasingly at risk as the number of initiatives announced in response to such
pressures outpaces its capacity to deliver. Government has, for instance, moved on a wide front
of anticorruption measures, many of which were initiated under President Habibie, including an
anticorruption law, establishment of a joint investigation team focusing initially on corruption in
the judiciary, a national ombudsman commission, as well as preparations for an independent
anticorruption agency. But these initiatives have been largely ad hoc and often overlap, some
have faltered for lack of budget, and for most others the progress is slow. On the legal reform
side, the initial efforts by the Law Reform Commission has found little resonance in
Government. Considerable mistrust persists due to the failure to indict-until recently-any
judge suspected of bribe-taking. Corruption in the Attorney General's office and the police is
compounded by lack of capacity to carry out successful prosecution. On the civil service side,
there is as yet little effort to address the longer-term issue of civil service reforms.
ECONOMIC

OUTLOOK AND RISKS

19.
Indonesia's external environment is likely to become less favorable over the CAS
period than it was in the year 2000. World GDP growth is expected to gradually slow down
from over 4 percent in 2000 to somewhat above 3 percent in 2003. Growth in the USA,
Indonesia's largest trading partner, is to slow down more rapidly, but that of Japan-the second
largest trading partner-will retain a modest 2 percent pace. Growth in world trade is likely to
come down as well-from over 11 percent in 2000 to some 8 percent for the rest of the CAS
period. This will put pressure on Indonesia's export-led recovery, and on the current account.
The expected decline in oil prices-from $28/barrel (bbl) in 2000 to under $20/bbl in 2003-will
further reduce Indonesia's current account surplus over time. While international interest rates
are not expected to rise, Indonesia's risks premium-at present more than 700 basis points over
US Treasuries-reflects continued negative sentiments of international investors towards the
country.
20.
Several macroeconomic risks could affect Indonesia's prospects. The high domestic
and foreign debt, a weak banking and corporate sector, and a growth rate that is much lower than
before the crisis make Indonesia particularly vulnerable to such risks. The key risks are a more
rapid decline in oil prices, a further depreciation of the currency, and an increase in domestic
interest rates. The Government's ambitious decentralizationplan will exert fiscal risks as well.

11

* A more rapid decline in oil prices than that assumed in the economic base-case scenario (see
below) would put pressure on the current account of the balance of payments. But because oil
revenues will in future be shared with the regions and oil subsidies are still paid by the
central government, the initial impact on the budget is fairly modest. For every dollar decline
in oil price, the central budget deficit increases by about $50 million, or less than 0.05
percent of GDP.
* A further depreciation of the Rupiah would hurt the budget more: although oil revenues will
rise in Rupiah terms, the increase is shared with the regions, and the central government
would face higher spending on foreign interest payments and imported goods. On a net basis,
an exchange rate depreciation of 1,000 Rupiah/US dollar would add some 0.15-0.2 percent of
GDP to the budget deficit. Equally, banks and corporations will both remain vulnerable to
external shocks in exchange rates and interest rates, in view of the slow progress in financial
and corporate restructuring. A weakening of their position may add to the bank
recapitalizationcosts, and reduce revenues from IBRA recoveries.
* But the largest macroeconomicrisk stems from the Government's high domestic debt, which
is largely in the form of floating rate bonds. Higher domestic real interest rates-triggered
by, for instance, political turmoil could cause fiscal havoc: a one percentage point increase in
real interest rates would cost the Government some 0.3 percent of GDP, or $500 million
equivalent.
-

And, despite safeguards, there are considerable risks to fiscal discipline associated with the
decentralizationprogram. For next year, the Government has included a contingency reserve
of some 0.6 percent of GDP in the budget, and it aims to disallow regional borrowing for
now (except from the central government). However, failure to decentralize the civil service,
strong regional demands for extra resources, and a weakening of the no-borrowing rule could
trigger fiscal pressures and macro-instability.

21.
The fragile political environment and its associated risks to the ongoing reform
effort are reflected in the current economic outlook for the "muddle-through" base-case
scenario. Prospects for a sustainable recovery in Indonesia critically depend on progress in bank
and corporate restructuring, smooth fiscal decentralization within a framework of overall fiscal
consolidation, continued monetary stability and improved governance. But these are complex
and far-reaching reforms which require effective government implementation and a sound legal
environment-and so expectations of progress must be modest. The "muddle-through" base-case
scenario-which represents our assessment of the most likely outcome-assumes that
macroeconomic stability is maintained, but that structural reforms are implemented slowly, with
frequent slippages and some policy reversals. Investor confidence and private investment
(domestic and foreign) revive barely enough to keep GDP growth at about 4 percent a year
during the period of the country assistance strategy (CAS, FY01-03). In the absence of decisive
policy action, the fiscal position remains marginally sustainable, and the government debt-GDP
ratio is expected to decline only modestly to about 88 percent by 2003.7 External debt to GDP

and LondonClub.

12
will also marginally decline, because lackluster investment activity would limit pressure on the
current account of the balance of payments. Table 1.2 shows key economic indicators for the
base case and high case scenarios.

22.
A high-case ("performance") scenario would result from greater political stability,
and more aggressive implementation of structural reforms. This involves an acceleration of
bank and corporate restructuring, careful management of the ongoing fiscal decentralization
program, and appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies (as agreed in Government's
Extended Arrangement); as well as key actions on legal and judicial reforms, civil service
reforms and toward improving financial management and procurement practices. These reforms
will help improve investor confidence and raise investment to pre-crisis levels which, in turn,
could drive higher GDP growth from 2002 onward. Higher investment demand would reduce the
surplus on the current account more rapidly than in the base case. Higher growth, lower interest
rates in light of better inflation performance, more asset recovery, and an appreciating exchange
rate will accelerate the decline of Government debt to GDP to some 76 percent of GDP by 2003,
while external debt to GDP also declines more rapidly to 73 percent of GDP by the same year.
23.
Unfortunately, there is also a not insignificant possibility of a "crisis" scenario. A
key risk is a breakdown of the Government's Extended Arrangement with the IMF as a result of
major policy slippage, including inadequate progress on bank and corporate restructuring. This
could lead to a rapid erosion of market confidence and deterioration in economic conditions. A
similar outcome could result from political instability or a widespread breakdown in law and
order. In both cases, the turmoil would be reflected in a further deterioration in financial
markets-especially interest rates and the exchange rate-which would cause a deterioration in
the fiscal and balance of payment position. Yet another crisis scenario could result from external
shocks such as a more rapid decline in oil prices, a more rapid slow-down of the global economy
and global trade growth, or a rise in world interest rates, which could trigger renewed
macroeconomicimbalances. Although the consequences are likely to be a far cry from the 199799 crisis, the impact of a macroeconomic shock could severely hit a more vulnerable Indonesia,
facing a much higher debt burden
24.
The external financing position is likely to remain fragile in any scenario. The
current account surplus is likely to decline as demand recovers and imports grow while oil prices
decline and non-oil export growth slows. New private equity inflows through direct or portfolio
investment are likely to remain modest as long as governance reforms, corporate restructuring
and privatization remain hesitant. Indonesian companies' access to new external private

13
borrowing is likewise expected to be limited as long as their debts are not resolved and their
balance sheets remain weak. Despite debt rescheduling by the Paris Club, debt-service on the
Government's liabilities will continue to impose a heavy burden on government revenues-and
more so after March 2002 when the current Paris Club agreement ends. Further debt
rescheduling by official bilateral and private creditors is unlikely, and the Government is
correctly reluctant to incur new debt from commercial sources. The Government's debt burden
places a premium on concessional sources of external finance. It has, therefore, requested the
Bank to blend its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) lending with
additional International Development Association (IDA) resources. In the high case,
disbursements from the additional IDA conimitments, as proposed in the CAS (see para. 78),
would begin to benefit the budget mainly in the year 2002 and beyond. This higher external
financing would also support the emerging current account deficit caused by the higher
investment level in the performance scenario. Additional IDA funds would be contingent on
Government's strong performance on governance and poverty, which in turn will help boost
investor confidence and prospects for an early recovery and enable Indonesia's rapid return to
the international capital markets.
25.
Moving forward, the challenges are enormous. In any future scenario for the short to
medium term, there is likely to be considerablepolitical turmoil, stop-go policies on reforms, and
capacity constraints impeding the Government's ability to carry through on its commitments.
The probability is high that Indonesiawill "muddle through". The challenge for the Government,
and for Indonesia's development partners, will be managing this uncertainty and helping reduce
the associated risks. But there is also a real possibility-given Indonesia's past impressive
development record-that from this process of muddling through will emerge enough
momentum around a subset of reforms that it will be possible to lay the foundations for a more
sustained development effort. Indeed the challenge for Indonesia's development partners will be
to encourage and to help bring about this latter outcome.

BANK GROUP RESPONSE AND PRIORITIES
PROGRESS
SINCELASTCAS

26.
In accordance with the CAS Progress Report the Bank focused on social safety nets,
economic recovery, and governance reform. The Bank continued its strong social impact
monitoring, and prepared a comprehensive poverty report which now forns the basis for the
poverty focus of the CAS. The Social Safety Net Adjustment Loan (SSNAL) helped protect and
rationalize budgets for critical crisis response programs, improved designs and targeting, and
helped open the way for civil society involvement in program monitoring. Investment lending
focused on projects in health and education. In support of economic stabilization and recovery,
the Bank continued its intensive participation in the Government's Extended Arrangement with
the IMF (para. 13), with responsibility for the major structural and social reform componentsbesides social safety nets, the Bank focused on bank and corporate restructuring, along with
sectoral reforms in agriculture and energy. A second policy reform support loan was approved in
May 1999. The Bank stepped up its work on governance and anti-corruption in close
collaboration with partners. It helped establish the Partnership for Governance Reform in
Indonesia, which brings together Governnent, civil society, private sector, and donors to
facilitate a national dialogue on governance. The Bank is leading similar donor groups in other
areas (para. 62). It chaired three CGI meetings since the last Progress Report in which
Government and donors discussed progress on the economic programnand governance agenda.
Representatives of civil society now attend as observers.
27.
Lending fell short of the CAS Progress Report base case scenario. During FY98-00,
the Bank committed a total of $3.6 billion, or $1.3 billion below the base case scenario in the
Table2.1: BankLending:Changes
Progress Report (see Table 2.1). The shortfall in

reforms, as well as the Governmnent's reduced

increase in public debt and Parliament's direction to
reduce dependence on foreign borrowing. As a result of these trends, IBRD debt outstanding has
been held to about $11.8 billion (end-FYOO).
28.
The Bank's project portfolio has started to recover from the crisis impact, and
fiduciary controls have been strengthened although risks of "leakage" remain high.
Economic recovery and the Bank's portfolio restructuring efforts have substantially reduced
portfolio risk and improved performance in line with our earlier plans (see Table 2.2). As part of
restructuring, the Bank canceled over $1.6 billion of undisbursed funds. Indonesia was removed
from the Bank's "priority country list" for portfolio improvement plans. The Bank has begun to

implementation and use of funds in a number of new projects (see Box 2.1 on recent anticorruption efforts in Bank-financedprojects). The Bank's portfolio was subjected to a number of
audits, which acknowledged the stronger management controls while recognizing the challenge
of addressing corrupt practices in projects in Indonesia. This challenge is expected to grow as the
Bank's portfolio shifts increasinglyto "soft" sectors involving smaller procurement contracts and
implementation takes place in a newly decentralized administrativeand political environment.
Box 2.1: Recent Anti-corruption Efforts in Bank-Financed Projects
While it is not possible to insulate Bank-frnanced projects from the country environment in which they are
implemented,a number of steps have been taken to strengthen fiduciary controls including:
* Tightening of reviews of implementing agencies' procurement financed by the Bank and paying more
attention to procurement issues at early stages of project preparation.
* Conducting assessments of the capacity of executing agencies to carry out procurement and financial
management, and intensifying ex-post reviews of those contracts that are not subject to prior review by
Bank staff under the Bank's procurement guidelines. This also led to a declaration of misprocurement
totaling $4.1 million in FYOO.
* Maintaininga database of complaintson procurement.
* Enhancing monitoring of compliance with accounting and auditing requirements, and following up on
significant audit findings with executing agencies.
* Protecting resources allocated to project supervision despite pressures on the overall administrative budget.
* Promoting beneficiary involvement in the design and implementation of Bank projects, particularly by
building relations with civil society and local communities to help prevent misuse of development funds.
Additionally, the Bank prepared a portfolio brief (in English and Bahasa Indonesia) to inform civil society
about the Bank-financed projects.
* In collaborationwith Government and the Asian DevelopmentBank (ADB), the Bank carried out a country
procurement assessment (CPAR, FYOO)and country financial accountability assessment (CFAA, FY01)
which made recommendations for reform. These were followed by a mission of senior Bank staff to review
the fiduciary environment, which made recommendations to strengthen the public procurement and
financial management systems and to further strengthen the fiduciary oversight of Bank-financed projects
(see para. 68).

16
LESSONSFROMTHECRISIS

29.
The lessons from the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) review of the
Bank's role leading up to the crisis were absorbed in the Bank's program.8 The reorientation
of the Bank's program toward poverty alleviation and governance reform addresses the major
criticism that the Bank paid insufficient attention to these aspects. This includes efforts to absorb
the political, institutional and social dimensionsmore fully in our country assessments and areas
for future assistance. The Bank's relationship with Government has become more candid as we
speak out publicly on areas of concern. It has opened up vis-a-vis civil society and strives for
enhanced disclosure of its activities. The Bank also speaks out more in the media. The recent
shift toward a more open and democratic Indonesia provides a more favorable environment for
popular participation in government programns,and engagement with civil society. But it does not
ensure that past concerns (e.g., on corruption) will be addressed. And the Bank is expected to
remain the target of civil society criticism for its association with the past regime (see paras. 3133 below).
30.
At the program level, the Bank is including important lessons from the crisis as it
repositions its future operations. The Bank's poverty work has generated important findings on
the multidimensional nature of poverty in Indonesia, and developed a deeper understanding of
the non-material aspects of poverty. It has learned from the work on the effectiveness of local
institutions and communities, as well as from input from civil society during consultations. The
lessons from the two recent village infrastructure projects and the ongoing Kecamatan
development project underlined the strengths of local-level institutions and the importance of
"bottom up" planning to better match needs and aspirations with resources. These in turn are the
basis for our focus in the CAS on demand-responsive approaches in delivery of public services,
which will be absorbed in our future lending for social sectors and basic infrastructure. At the
same time, the Bank recognizes the limitations of its recent crisis adjustment lending in
Indonesia. The SSNAL, while pioneering program safeguards for more transparency and
accountability which improved the effectiveness of crisis programs for the poor, also brought out
the difficulty of seeking fundamental institutional reforrns in the operations of government
programs through an adjustment lending instrument. The crisis social safety net programs also
revealed the difficulty of reaching the poor with govermnent programs. In fact, the poor mostly
coped by relying on their ingenuity, sacrifices and hard work. Success of the Water Sector
Adjustment Loan (WATSAL) underlined the importance of "ownership" of reform by the
agencies involved. Through the crisis, the International Finance Corporation's (IFC's) portfolio
benefited from its policy of not supporting projects promoted by sponsors with close affiliation
to political leaders. In IFC's future operations, it will be particularly careful in selecting credible
sponsors,who are transparent, professional and capable.
FEEDBACKFROM CONSULTATIONS

31.
The CAS has been informed by a series of public consultations with civil society
organizations (CSOs). A total of about 400 organizationstook part, over a three-month period,
through interviews, seminars, and focus group discussions held in four different locations in

Indonesia. The recommendations were compiled and discussed at a national roundtable held in
Jakarta in August 2000. They focused on the following themes: economic recovery and poverty
alleviation, decentralization of development and regional authority, education, labor issues and
employment, improving governance and combating corruption, debt, and community and nongovernmental organization (NGO) participation in Bank projects. Consultations also took place
with a cross-sectionof private sector interests and the results of these consultations are outlined
in the Bank Group Private Sector Strategy for Indonesia,prepared along with the CAS (para. 43).
A summary of civil society feedback is shown below (see Box 2.2).
32.
The consultations took place in a very constructive atmosphere, although the Bank
was reminded of concerns about its association with the past regime, particularly where it
concerns debt and corruption (see Box 2.2). While it was recognized that a number of
recommendations from the consultations were directed more toward Government than the Bank,
particularly where these involve changes in policy, many recommendations are reflected in the
Bank's strategy. The types of projects in the CAS lending program are much closer to civil
society preferences with their decentralized, community-based approaches. The Bank plans to
involve civil society representatives more upstream in the design of future projects, and to make
optimal use of disclosure to disseminate information on its activities and projects. It also
strengthened anti-corruption controls in its projects, and intends to involve beneficiaries and civil
society groups more closely in monitoring. As a follow-up to the national consultation meeting,
the Bank plans to support joint Bank-CSO working groups on selected topics (e.g., civil society
involvement in Bank projects, micro-finance), provided there is enough interest on the part of
CSOs. A full list of recommendations from the consultations, together with the Bank's response,
is covered in a separate report on the CAS civil society consultations.9

Participants saw value in the Bank working on curriculum and teacher training improvements in the
national education system, and in developing links with labor groups.
The Bank was asked to emphasize grassroots activities, involving communities in all aspects of the project
cycle and to facilitate the active participation of civil society organizations that are better placed to assist in
bottom-up planning of community initiatives. Further dissemination of Bank information was called for.
The debt issue remains controversial with many CSOs calling for debt reduction, a halt to new lending, or
lending at highly concessional terms only. They asked that loans for technical assistance should be
minimized, and adjustment loans phased out.
Feedback indicated that the Bank had paid insufficient attention to the use of its funds, and should share
responsibility -for corruption in Indonesia. The Bank was asked to promote anti-corruption reform,
investigate suspected cases of corruption, support establishment of CSO watchdog groups, and intensify
attention to environmentaland social safeguards.

The report is made available on the Bank's Indonesia website (www.worldbank.or.id).

18
33.
There remain areas where the Bank differs from the recommendations of the CSOs.
Debt is probably the most important one. The Bank has explained that Indonesia is not eligible
for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, and that it cannot
accept the arguments put forward that part of Bank debt should be canceled as it would have
been subject to corruption and should be considered "criminal" or "odious." At the same time,
the Bank has worked in different ways to address Indonesia's debt problem. It has (a) provided
assistance on Indonesia's debt management options, (b) responded positively to Government's
requests to cancel undisbursed loan balances (over $1.6 billion) and reallocate funds to higherpriority activities (about $1 billion), and (c) sought greater access to highly concessional IDA
resources. The Bank has also strengthened its fiduciary controls to address any misuse of funds
in Bank-financedprojects. There are other areas where the Bank may differ from the civil society
feedback. The Bank would be more positive than CSOs on proceeding more rapidly with
privatization in the interest of efficiency improvement, although it strongly agrees with the need
for transparency and fairness.
BANKGROUP'S COMPARATIVEADVANTAGE
34.
The Bank Group remains a high profile player in Indonesia. The Bank Group plays
an important coordinating role among donors in its role as chair of the Consultative Group for
Indonesia (CGI). And key bilateral donors look to it to take the lead on the development policy

agenda. The Bank also co-leads donor efforts in governance reform (with special focus on legal,
anti-corruption and civil service reforms), competition policy, water resource management, and
forestry. Even where it is not in the lead, Government and donors rely on it for strong analytical
and advisory support (decentralization, SMEs, corporate governance, privatization). The Bank
plays a key role in Government's Extended Arrangement with the IMF, working closely with the
IMF and ADB. And its relationship with key policymakers continues to be good-although
where it differs on policy it tends to do so more openly than in the past. The Bank's comparative
advantage is based on a strong presence in Jakarta which allows a fast response, a good
analytical base on the economy, sectors, and key development issues (poverty, governance,
public expenditure management), a good understanding of the implementation environment
through the Bank's large and varied project portfolio, a capacity to channel considerable
financial resources through lending and trust funds, and its ability to draw on global knowledge
through the Bank's networks.
35.
Indonesia is also supported, with technical expertise and financial resources, by a
wide range of development partners. These includes more than 20 bilateral and over 10
multilateral governmental organizations and several UN agencies, with programs of various size
and focus. Indonesia also counts many non-governmental organizations, such as the Ford
Foundation and World Wildlife Fund, and private-sector partners among its supporters. In the
context of the CGI meeting in October 2000, donors pledged up to $4.8 billion of official aid for
2001 -contingent on budget needs-and an additional $530 million in technical assistance
grants and financial support for non-governmental organizations. This level of support is in
proportion to Indonesia's scale, diversity and development challenges. There is room for donors
to specialize in their areas of expertise, for example the UN takes the lead on humanitarian relief,
while the World Bank Group and the ADB focus on longer-term development policy support and
investments. At the same time, there are may common interests and a need for close
collaboration as all partners work to best meet Indonesia's requirements.

19
36.
This argues for a selective, flexible approach by the World Bank Group, building on
past successes, learning from others and collaborating whenever possible. The Bank will
focus on areas where it can have the greatest impact on poverty and where there is strong local
ownership and capacity to deliver. Its program will aim for resilience to shifting local conditions.
Most of the Bank's new poverty-oriented, community-basedprograms have these features. Civil
society has also asked the Bank to focus on these areas. At the same time, the Bank will need to
look opportunistically for areas where possible breakthroughsin policy are possible and provide
the necessary support to facilitate change. These opportunities are likely to shift during the CAS
period, underscoring the need for flexibility. This also calls for greater reliance on analytical and
advisory services, and for proactive management of the portfolio. Where the Bank is less
effective in responding to development challenges, it relies on other donors to take the lead in
partnership fashion (see para. 62).
DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES FOR THE BANK GROUP

37.
Support for Indonesia's political and economic transition in a highly uncertain
environment. The CAS Progress report provided a road map for responding to the crisis. This
CAS attempts to spell out a Bank Group strategy during the forthcoming period of political and
economic transition, and to help it manage the considerable risks associated with the large
uncertainties in Indonesia today. This implies a two-pronged approach for the Bank Group. First,
the Bank Group will need to provide continued support for efforts to sustain the stabilization and
structural reform objectives under the economic recovery program and help the Government
manage the considerable risks associated with the impending decentralization program. Second,
the Bank Group will need to help Indonesia lay the foundations for a sound medium-term
development strategy focused on reducing poverty and vulnerability for the bottom half of
Indonesia's population.
38.
The overarching goal of the Bank Group's CAS will be to reduce poverty and
vulnerability in a more open and decentralized environment. This will require attention to
government policies that promote broad-based economic growth as a key requirement for
poverty reduction. At the same time, the quality of growth matters to make it sustainable and
genuinely pro-poor. But it is not just what government does, not just how much the government
spends, but how well its services are provided. Strong improvements in governance will be
critical to winning back confidence from private investors and giving voice to the poor. With the
far reaching decentralization of government functions just around the corner, actions will be
required to build strong governance both at the national and local levels to ensure effective
public service delivery to the poor. Accordingly, the Bank Group's strategy will focus on
working closely with its donor partners on the following three broad priority areas which are
closely related to Government's priorities in its economic recovery program and its medium-term
developmentplan:
*

Sustaining economic recovery and promoting broad-based growth. In the short run, this
requires macroeconomic stability and accelerated bank and corporate restructuring. In the
medium term, it will involve policies and public expenditures aimed at poverty reduction,
efficient private sector growth, and human capital and infrastructure development to improve
competitiveness;

20
* Building national institutions for accountable government, which includes legal and
judicial reforms, civil service reforms, better public financial management and procurement,
effective decentralization; and close attention to sustainable management of the rapidly
depleting natural resource base of the country; and
* Delivering better public services for the poor, which involves assistance to help define
government roles and responsibilities as functions are decentralized, support for improved
public service delivery by sub-national governments which have demonstrated pro-poor, progrowth reform, as well as promoting community development and selective assistance to
post-conflict areas.
Sustaining Economic Recovery and Promoting Broad-based Growth
39.
Acceleratingbank and corporate restructuring.In the short run, the core agenda in the
financial sector focuses on restoring profitability to the banks, improving supervision, and
moving firmly forward with the restructuring and divestiture of the state banks. In the medium
term, Government must develop a strategy to reduce the state's involvement in the financial
sector-and then implement it. Moving ahead on corporate restructuring involves
implementation of the enhanced corporate restructuring framework,'0 adopting further means to
force cooperation of recalcitrant debtors, remove tax and regulatory impediments to corporate
restructuring, and accelerate IBRA's asset disposal.
40.
Bank assistance in this area will remain a high priority, and it will continue to work
closely with the IMF and ADB as part of Government's Extended Arrangement (para. 13). In
bank restructuring, the Bank will retain its leadership role for work on state banks (excluding
Bank Mandiri) and IBRA, while the Fund will work with Bank Indonesia (the central bank),
Bank Mandiri, and private banks' restructuring. The Bank will lead a joint effort with the other
international financial institutions to help Government develop a medium-term financial sector
strategy. In corporate restructuring, the Bank's focus will continue to be on creating and
supporting the enabling framework for effective resolution including the support for the
corporate restructuring activities of IBRA's two asset management units, the Jakarta Initiative
Task Force (JITF), and for improving the commercial court and bankruptcy process. The
immediate priority is to establish a clear, transparent and consistent set of principles to govern all
large debt restructurings by IBRA. IFC's priority is to focus on strengthening existing financial
institutions through investments, attracting strategic investors where possible. In addition to
individual restructuring transactions with its existing clients, IFC will explore opportunities to
leverage its limited resources at wholesale level through specialized investment funds for urgent
equity funding needs of corporates.
41.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. A key challenge will
be to maintain fiscal sustainability as Government manages the high debt burden and complex
decentralization program, while at the same time protecting essential development spending.

10

The enhanced framework involves improved coordination, allowing IBRA to apply discounts, strengthening
JITF's leverage for referral of uncooperative debtors to the Attorney General, time-bound mediation
procedures, and removal of regulatory irnpediments.

21

Important steps involve raising fiscal revenues, phasing out anti-poor fuel subsidies, improving
fiscal management, and accelerating privatization and asset recovery. In support of the
Government's Extended Arrangement with the IMF, the IMF leads the effort on macroeconomic
policies, the Bank focuses on structural and social policies, the ADB leads on privatization and
SMEs, while the IMF, the World Bank and ADB have joint responsibility for financial sector
issues (para. 13).
42.
Promoting pro-poor policies and public expenditures. For the most part, families and
individuals will escape poverty and reduce their vulnerability through their own efforts. To help
foster an environment in which individuals can make progress, the Bank will focus on the
following areas:
* Supporting broad-based poverty reducing economic growth by keeping rice prices
affordable and internal trade open, and supporting rural development through
provision of basic infrastructure,credit, research and extension services. Affordable rice
prices matter to the poor because they are net rice consumers. Import controls or higher
tariffs on rice would hurt the poor by raising rice prices. The Bank will continue to provide
policy advice in this critical area. Since over 70 percent of incomes in rice-growing regions is
from non-rice sources, the emphasis of the Bank's rural development support-through
analytical work and project support-lies in greater attention to the foundations of rural
economicactivity.
*

Helping to empower the poor through access to secure possession of land and natural
resources and increasing the availability of financial services to them. The Bank is
working to encourage stakeholder dialogue on forestry and land policy. It is also undertaking
analytical work and supporting preparation of a second land administration project to help
reverse past practices of land allocation and distribution which disadvantaged the poor,
including their community held lands. The Bank's support for micro-finance will focus on
increasing access by the poor and institutional strengthening, rather than credit subsidies. A
micro finance project is foreseen for FY03. Sound labor market policies are equally
important for raising the economic prospects of the poor, as they are helped by a
development strategy that favors a rapidly expanding demand for labor and fosters equitable

and just labor conditions (see Box 2.3). Among donors, the ILO has the lead in this area.
Helping to keep a poverty focus in public expenditures,including looking hard at what
subsidies can be eliminated, and supporting poverty reduction by local governments.
The Bank will continue to support the Government's policy of reducing fuel subsidies which
at Rp 36 trillion in 2001 cost more than the entire development budget, and redirecting funds
to fund pro-poor programs. How best to encourage poverty agendas at the local levelthrough budget transfer-is a question the Indonesians are debating and its resolution will
equally apply to large donors whose funds pass through the central government. This would
involve piloting of different approaches to find what works best. It will also involve tracking
of social and poverty indicators. The Bank will focus on the fiscal transfer framework, as
well as the minimum standards of service delivery. These will be addressed through policy
advice and technical assistance, and in the context of proposed projects in health, education
and basic infrastructure.
43.
Enabling competitive private sector development. The Bank Group's private sector
development strategy is integrated across the Group's activities. It involves a combination of
policy reform and institutional strengthening to address: (a) an inadequate business environment
resulting from poor public governance and corruption, a weak legal and judicial system with
poor enforcement, inadequate corporate governance, and continued red tape and burdensome
regulations, particularly on SME activities; and (b) a concentrated corporate ownership structure
and continued dominance of the state in key sectors combined with an underdeveloped SME
sector which in other countries has been the driving force for growth and employment
generation. The Bank Group's private sector development strategy, including an elaboration of
the respective roles of the Bank, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA), is elaborated in a separate report prepared in connection with the CAS,11of which a
summary is shown in Annex 1. The private sector agenda focuses on:
*

helping Indonesia accelerate and complete the recovery from the crisis through banking and
corporate restructuring (para. 39);

*

addressing structural weaknesses in the economy through technical assistance, policy advice
and partnerships, as well as ongoing Bank Group projects, to (a) improve public governance
and reducing corruption, (b) improve corporate governance; (c) reform legal and judicial
systems, (d) develop a modern competition policy framework, (e) promote foreign direct
investment; and (f) reduce the role of the state through privatization of state-owned
enterprises; and

* promoting long-term sustainable growth through (a) development of the SME sector,
including provision of policy advice on the business environment, piloting innovative
programs, helping establish SME support services, and building financial intermediaries,
through IFC investment and capacity building initiatives; (b) promoting the role of the
private sector in rural and urban development, through ongoing investment projects and
planned adaptable program loans (APLs) in water and urban sectors; (c) promoting private

23
delivery of infrastructure and services in health and education, initially through analytical
work on the potential for private provision of health services; (d) promoting sustainable
private development of Indonesia's forest and mineral resources, and (e) preparing Indonesia
for the knowledge economy by helping create the legal, institutional and regulatory
framework for the new information and communications technologies, in part through
assistance from an ongoing informationtechnology project.
44.
Human capital development for competitive growth. Development of human capital at
all levels is critical to both the near and medium term efforts to sustain economic recovery and
growth in Indonesia. Decentralization of the delivery of most government services makes
capacity building at all levels a priority. Training programs, whether for district officials, local
health service administrators or SME managers, have been chronically weak, but the needs will
be far greater with decentralization.In the near term, the challenges of delivering basic education
at the province and district levels and increasing access to quality basic education and health for
Indonesia's children will take first priority in Bank assistance, and will be supported by ongoing
and proposed projects in education and health, and analytical and advisory activities (AAA). In
the medium term, attention must be given to skills development and modernizing safety nets, so
that skill shortages and the continuing vulnerability to risks such as catastrophic income loss or
prohibitive curative health costs will not impede Indonesia's competitive growth. The Bank's
assistance in these medium-term areas will be directed in part at the restructuring of Indonesia's
senior secondary and higher education and training sectors, both public and private-initially
with analytical work and policy dialogue and then, if appropriate, with lending support. Support
would be focused on sub-national and regional networks of education and training delivery
systems, both public and private. In addition, the Bank, in collaboration with the University of
Indonesia, is engaged in establishing a Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), which
will provide opportunities for decisionmakers and others to access a global network of peers to
share ideas and experience in the main development challenges. Furthermore, assistance will
focus on assisting in the design and implementation of situation-relevant health insurance
approaches, through ongoing AAA and project work.
45.
Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. As economic recovery takes hold, more
infrastructure bottlenecks are expected to appear and become a drag on economic growth.
Particularly as public spending on maintenance and preservation (especially in roads, water
supply and sanitation) have declined over the past few years, and the implementation of
infrastructure projects requires long lead times. Decentralization is expected to complicate
management of infrastructure, as responsibilities need to be clarified, service standards and
investments may further deteriorate, and interregional linkages may suffer. The Bank Group
strategy is aimed at: (a) providing assistance for essential investments in maintenance and
rehabilitation through ongoing projects and proposed investment projects in eastern Indonesia
roads and irrigation systems; (b) improving the policy and legal framework of key sectors (e.g.,
water, energy) to facilitate competitive private sector investment, including better cost recovery,
phasing out inefficient subsidies, development of regulatory capacity, and restructuring sector
entities (e.g., state electricity company PLN); and (c) facilitating the implementation of agreed
government reforms through joint action by the donors and contributing to financing of future
infrastructure needs, by mobilizing co-financing from ADB, the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (JBIC) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and
others, and, where appropriate, using the Bank Group's various instruments-including possible

24
guarantees. Focus will increasingly be at the regional level to work with receptive local
governments in improving local capacity and supporting basic investments in preservation and
upgrading of existing facilities and services, and addressing key bottlenecks. IFC will seek
opportunities to encourage private investment in infrastructure in sectors where a suitable
regulatory framework is emerging, by seeking to engage commercial and technical partners who
will transfer international practice to management and operations of utilities and other
infrastructureservice companies.
Building National Institutions for Accountable Government
46.
Strong improvements in governance will be critical to winning back investor
confidence,giving voice to the poor, protecting the environment, and a key requirement for
long term stability. At the national level, action is required on legal and judicial reforms, civil
service reforms, improving public financial management and public procurement, and helping
the central government better manage its planned major decentralization program. Success
depends on strong leadership and ownership from Government for a set of key actions which
would bear results over the medium to long term, while looking for a few "quick wins" to build
political support for the agenda. A key priority is reducing opportunities for corruption, by
strengthening accountability and transparency in the public sector through better procurement,
financial management, and audit. At the regional level, decentralization provides an opportunity
for Governmentto becoming truly accountable to the people. A high priority will be ensuring the
emergence of sound public economic and financial management at the local level with a
particular focus on fiduciary controls. At both national and regional levels, the Bank will also
approach national environmental policies from the prism of good governance, focusing on
forestry and water management. The Bank's involvement in this area is at two levels.
47.
First, through the Partnership for Governance Reforms in Indonesia-an
Indonesian-led body that brings together Government, civil society, the private sector and
Indonesia's major development partners-the Bank together with its two co-sponsoring
partners (UNDP and ADB) is supporting the promotion of a national policy dialogue on
selected areas of governance. This dialogue would be underpinned by strategic funding of key
governance initiatives aimed at pushing important reform efforts and helping strengthen the
demand for governance reforms. These initiatives are funded by a Governance Fund financed by
donors. An active Indonesian governing board has identified three cross cutting issues as
priorities for the Partnership: anti-corruption, decentralization, and an information outreach on
good governance. The Bank's role in the Partnership is to take the lead in coordinating donor
support in two areas of governance reform: legal and judicial reforms and civil service reforms.
In addition, the Bank is playing a key role in bringing its global knowledge to bear on the work
on anti-corruption and decentralization,particularly through active support from the World Bank
Institute (WBI) and the Public Sector Board. It helped the Partnership run a successful anticorruption workshop and is working towards helping develop a national anti-corruption strategy.
48.
Second, the Bank is attempting to advance the agenda for governance reforms
through direct support to Government in the following areas:
*

legal and judicial reforms: The Bank's objective in this perhaps most critical area for
strengthening the underpinnings for Indonesia's nascent democracy and helping win back

25
investor confidence, is to assist Government to develop and implement a time-bound
program of action drawing on the promising work of the Law Reform Commission. For such
a program to succeed it will need to be reinforced with decisive action to reduce corruption in
the judiciary as a signal of the Government's commitment to such reforms. This will be a
major focus of the Bank's dialogue with Government in 2001, drawing heavily on the
resources of a multi-donor team.
* civil service reforms: The Bank has pursued this issue for over a year through analytical and
advisory work, with an initial focus on pay and employmentpolicies and the decentralization
of civil service functions. A new report on this issue will be shortly discussed with
Government to test the waters of reform. Drawing on this report and on further planned
work, the Bank will assist the Government in developing and implementing a civil service
strategy.
* decentralization: The Bank is working with the IMF, the ADB and donors to help
Government contain the risks from the impending decentralization focusing on fiscal
decentralization,including measures to support poorer areas and encourage poverty reduction
efforts by sub-national governments (para. 42), and the implications for the civil service.
*

the Government's fiduciary controls: The Bank mounted a strong diagnostic effort in this
area, including preparation of a country procurement assessment review (CPAR, FY00) and a
country financial and accountability assessment (CFAA, FY01). A fiduciary mission from
the Bank visited Indonesia in October 2000 to help develop an agenda of action. This was
discussed at the CGI meeting in Tokyo and Government undertook to pursue this agenda
(para. 69). Progress in this area will be critical to a successful transition to a high case in
Indonesia.

49.
Sustainable natural resource management and environmental protection.
Indonesia's environment and natural resources are deteriorating at a considerable cost to society.
Decentralization will make this worse as inexperienced sub-national agencies are inheriting
management responsibilities. Actions are required to reach sustainable management of the most
precious resources-forests, farmland, fisheries, marine ecosystems, water and urban air. The
Bank's focus will be on the governance dimensions, since the principal constraint to sound
policies in this area are weak institutional capacity and pervasive corruption. The Bank will
concentrate on forestry and water resource management, where it is leading multi-donor efforts.
In forestry, the main issues involve illegal logging, the large imbalance between sustainable log
supply and industry requirements, poor management of production and protection areas, and illconceived forest conversion. Policy dialogue is in support of Government's formulation of a
National Forest Program involving all stakeholders. In water, the Bank aims for more integrated
management on river basin scale and for control of domestic waste water. In addition, we
support selective environmental management capacity building of local governments, and
development of a coral reef policy and strategy.
50.
The Bank's focus in the governance area has relied heavily on analytical and
advisory activities, but lending support is being contemplated to help strengthen central
government's capacity in the post-decentralization era. Reforms will only succeed if there is
strong government ownership and support. If this materializes, and the Bank's dialogue and

26
involvement in the Governance Partnership are all intended to bring about such an outcome, the
Bank would consider the possibility of a public sector reform loan/credit in a high case scenario.
Such an operation would support a program of public sector reforms and the proposed
decentralization, over a three to five-year period, covering support for reform in many of the
areas outlined above along with improvementsin public expendituremanagement. A key priority
will be to strengthen the central government's capacity to deliver on its residual responsibilities
in a post-decentralization era, particularly in setting standards, establishing development
priorities, monitoring performance and enhancing accountabilities. Thus such an operation would
attempt to provide an umbrella for the provincial level reform operations envisaged in the CAS
(see below). Such an operation could also provide matching grant support for sub-national
governmentsby establishing criteria that would create incentives for local governments to pursue
good governance strategies.
Delivering Better Public Services to the Poor
51.
In the words of the Government, "The overriding objective of decentralization is to
bring the government closer to the people. This enhances local government transparency
2 Indonesia is just beginning to
and accountability as well as community participation."1
decentralize and de-concentrate public service delivery, and there is still much to get right-from
finalizing regulations and achieving broad agreement with the regions on the implementation
timing and strategy, to ensuring civil servants get transferred and paid. As local governments
take up their new responsibilities, Government and donors can best support poverty reduction by
rewarding those that demonstrate pro-poor reform through matching grants or other resource
transfer vehicles. The Bank has started to rebuild its lending pipeline to selectively support
creation of capable, demand-responsive sub-national government institutions, and to eventually
target a limited number of provinces (2-4) and/or districts, including cities, which have
demonstratedreform. Support will focus on services from which the poor benefit most, including
basic education,health and basic infrastructure in rural and urban areas. Where district/provincial
governments are reluctant to undertake reform, central government and donors could directly
support community driven development. The Bank will thus continue to foster "bottom-up"
reform by building on its extensive experience with community development in Indonesia. As all
donors are affected by the newly decentralized environment, the Bank is also reviewing with
Government and other donors how best to coordinate the approach to sub-national assistance.
52.
In the short run (at least through 2002), the Bank will support the Government in
specific sectors and regions to maintain service delivery through the transition, while at the
same time helping to lay the groundwork for the Government and other donors to direct
assistance where it can be most effective in reducing poverty. Because responsibility for
decentralization of administrative functions lies with line-ministries and guidelines have been
very general or wanting, sectors are at different stages of preparation and taking different
approaches. There is a real risk of service disruption, declining governance standards, and local
decisions contrary to national interests. Some district governments appear to be taking steps to
protect services and are looking for opportunities for administrative and budget efficiencies. To
support the transition, the Bank's assistance will target three priority areas: (1) helping to define

12

27
sectoral roles and responsibilities across levels of government; (2) supporting a selected number
of local governments, which have put reform into practice, to improve the design and
implementation of service delivery; and (3) continuing to help directly empower communities in
poor regions (rural and urban). In addition, the Bank will provide selective assistance to areas in
conflict.
53.
First, the Bank will help Government define roles and responsibilities for each level
-center, province, district and below, and for private sector involvement Getting these
roles and responsibilities right during the transition period and re-orienting the civil service to
become responsive to those it is meant to serve will have long-term implications for the quality
of service delivery. For each sector, specific technical issues must be taken into account (see Box
2.4 for examples in irrigation, roads and environment). Thus, the Bank will give priority to
supporting Government to identify, give authority to, and build capacity at the appropriate
administration level, and help create openings for the private sector where appropriate. Primary
sectors of focus include: basic education, health, basic infrastructure (roads, irrigation, urban
services, and energy), and environmental management. This will be done in connection with
supervision of on-going projects, and as a particular focus in the preparation of new ones,
including eastern Indonesia roads, second provincial health, strengthening local education
Box 2.4: Getting The Right Level of Government Is Critical For Effective Service Delivery:
Examples from Irrigation, Roads and Environmental Management
Irrigation: Part of the sector is best served through "highly" decentralized arrangements (at the district level),
such as operations and maintenance (O&M) and water allocation in irrigation systems at the tertiary and
secondary canal levels. However, where externalities and economies of scale demand a more aggregated
approach, such as in river basin management (pollution control, O&M, erosion abatement, etc.), decisionmaking at an intermediate level is required with a larger involvement of provinces. Other functions are best
performed at the central level, such as development of policy and regulatory systems and standards, databases,
and support for large infrastructure such as dams. However, the picture is complicated as institutional
arrangements follow hydrological and not administrative boundaries. Thus, water user associations and river
basin corporations require close cooperation-between local governments and non-governmental entities as
well as among provincial and district governments.
Roads: If responsibility for all aspects of national/provincial roads are decentralized to the district level,
Indonesia risks degradation of service on its road network. Overall network planning-planning, programming,
and budgeting of a program of works (where national/provincial responsibility is needed) should be
distinguished from design and implementation of individual packets of works (where local responsibility is
appropriate). "Local" interests could put "local" projects before national/provincial ones, and roads in poorer
provinces could deteriorate rapidly. Moreover, if design and construction is decentralized before adequate
technical staff, competitive procurement (nationwide), and independent quality assurance or oversight are in
place, there is a risk of poor quality work, and deterioration of roads and bridges.
Environmental Management: Decentralizing the majority of environmental management authority to the
municipal (district) level is not appropriate; it is not a successful model in other countries, and most that have
tried it have recentralized partially or completely. As conceived, decentralization will shift resource
development decisions (industrial plant siting, major land development, and exploitation of natural resources)
to district control. Environmental assessments (EAs) will be reviewed by provincial commissions. But, where
provincial capacity is weak, or where there is no EA required, districts will give the approvals, and there are
many incentives for the district to exploit their resources in the short run and ignore longer-term consequences.

capacity (1&2), and improving quality and responsiveness of community-oriented healthcare, as
well as sectoral AAA work.
54.
Second, the Bank will support selected local governments who have put reform into
practice with the basics of effective service delivery and work toward identifying promising
provinces and districts for future support. Government commitment is the prerequisite to
effective aid. The Bank aims to help a limited set of provinces and districts (including cities)
which have demonstrated reform to develop the basics of transparent, accountable, and demandresponsive public service delivery (see Box 2.5), and to position the Bank to increase subnational programmatic and investment lending-both within and across sectors-once
conditions permit. The Bank will seek to support reform-minded, pro-poor leaders and
performing governments, through on-going supervision, project preparation, and sub-national
dialogue. Selection criteria and a short-list of areas would be reviewed with the central
government, to seek agreement on 2-4 provinces in which the Bank could initiate deeper
engagement through consultations with local governments and civil society, and through
provincial public expenditure reviews. Adjustable Program Loans (APLs) are being prepared for
water management-following reforms supported by the Bank-financed Water Sector
Adjustment Loan-and for urban services, which will support sub-national governments which
have taken concrete reform measures.13 The Bank is also assessing the feasibility of establishing
3-4 regional public information centers to expand its sub-nationalpresence.
Box 2.5: Encouraging"Demand-Responsive"

Create a "broker" or "facilitator" function that works to help the poor articulate their voice.

13 The final approach to APLs will depend on the fiscal transfer frameworkultimately agreed.

29
55.
Third, the Bank will continue to help empower communities so that poor
everywhere have an opportunity. Building on the successes of recent community-driven
development projects, the Bank will continue to focus on approaches in which project selection
and implementation are in the hands of communities, and which support civil society monitoring
of project implementation budgets and expenditures.14 This approach has shown to better match
community investments with local needs, and to build local social capital. In future projects, the
Bank will support the Government to retain and enhance the direct fund channeling mechanisms
and monitoring systems in these projects, which have yielded 20-40 percent savings over
standard public sector delivery of basic infrastructure.These projects would target poorer urban
and rural areas, on and off-Java, and will seek to further improve fiduciary controls, quality of
outputs, and links with district governments. Proposed new projects include Kecamatan
development project (supplemental), second Kecamatan development project, NTB poverty
(pilot), and community-basedurban development.
56.
Assistance to areas in conflict. At least five provinces are involved in serious violent
conflict, while others are affected by large numbers of people displaced by violence. About 15
ongoing Bank projects have components in four of these areas (Maluku, Central Sulawesi, Aceh,
West Timor). The Bank may have comparative strengths in dealing with post-conflict situations,
as it already deals with many of the underlying economic causes (economic disparities,
governance issues, weak government and civil society), and has developed innovative
approaches to community development and demand-responsive program design. The Bank's
Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) appoach provides a possible avenue for assistance to
post-conflict areas. But the Bank is not well placed to provide emergency assistance. And risks
are high as donor involvement may exacerbate divisions while there are possible reputational
risks to the Bank. The Bank therefore does not foresee taking a leadership role among donors in
this area, but will seek to get better integrated into the United Nations system for monitoring
conditions in violence prone areas and sharing Bank experience in successful poverty approaches
that may apply to such areas. Besides, the Bank will (a) develop a more systematic response to
the impact of conflict on ongoing projects to ensure continued development impact and
protection of project resources, and to create flexibility for possible refocusing of assistance on
reconstruction and development in post-conflict areas; and (b) selectively pilot innovative
approaches in violent prone areas that address critical needs of the poor (e.g., recent support for
widows in Aceh) as the basis for learning and possible wider application in other areas.

14

The communitydevelopmentmodel of the two completedvillageinfrastructureprojectsand the Kecamatan
developmentproject is now also applied in various other new projects-Urban PovertyProject,Water and
SanitationSupplyfor Low IncomeCommunitiesII, rural area developmentprojects,and the schoolbuilding
componentsin basiceducationprojects.

3. IMPLICATIONSFOR THE BANK GROUP PROGRAM
57.
The Bank Group's assistance program will require flexibility and adjustments as
circumstances change. The base case-considered to be the most likely scenario-presumes
that the current "muddle through" situation will continue, with some slippage in structural
reforms, but continued macroeconomic stability (para. 21) that would help sustain poverty
reduction. On the downside, there is the possibility of increasing political turmoil, further major
policy slippage or external shocks that may further delay implementation of the economic
program. At the same time, the change in government offers significant opportunities for
fundamental reform that have eluded Indonesia in the last three decades. The Bank Group's
program should be ready to respond and move to a high-case scenario in case reforms accelerate.
58.
The Bank Group's conservative base case program is expected to be reasonably
robust in the face of most downside risks, while at the same time positioning the Bank
Group for possible upside opportunities.The "muddle through" base case scenario provides a
tenuous base for Bank Group support to Indonesia. This is not a desirable scenario to undertake
much new lending and even harbors risks to our portfolio as fiduciary standards may slip in the
newly decentralizing environment. At the same time, the Bank is one of Indonesia's major longterm development partners and cannot disassociate itself as the country moves through its
historic democratic transition. The base case program takes account of these factors and provides
for a conservative Bank lending program of up to US$400 million per year with an average
65:35 IBRD/IDA blend over the CAS period. This is less than one third of pre-crisis lending
levels, and would result in a gradual reduction of the Bank's high exposure in Indonesia (para.
89). The focus will be on poverty and community developmentprojects which are expected to be
reasonably robust in such an uncertain environment. The minimum conditions for the base case
scenario would be the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, minimum fiduciary safeguards
for delivery of public services with decentralization, and establishment of organizational
arrangements, scope, process, and schedule for developing a broad-based poverty reduction
strategy. A continued strong AAA program in the base case would assist Government in
enhancing policy performance, which in turn may lead to a possible high case assistance
scenario-including enhanced IBRD and IDA lending. On the other hand, a possible
deterioration from the "muddle through" base case scenario could lead the Bank to cease all new
lending.
59.
The country's decentralization move will reshape the Bank Group's operating
environment. The Bank has begun to prepare for working in a decentralized environment. But
during the transition to such an environment, the Bank can expect significant difficulties to its
program. It has devoted significant resources to advising the Government on how to minimize
the associated risks. Decentralization also presents important medium-term opportunities for the
Bank. As explained in the previous section, the Bank has started a consultative process to
develop new ways of doing business in this new environment. Much of the Bank's future new
lending will be to assist sub-national governments.

31

60.
Indonesia's weak fiduciary environment poses continued risks for the Bank's
portfolio and lending activities. As noted, Indonesia suffers from weak traditions of
accountabilityin the public sector which has led to widespread corruption and misuse of public
funds. This affects donor funds in equal measure. The forthcoming decentralization of a large
share of public expendituresto regional governments will compound existing weaknesses. While
the Bank has made considerable progress in strengthening fiduciary controls (para. 28), the
challenge will be to further enhance protection of its portfolio and lending resources in a context
of greater risk. Protecting Bank-financedprojects in a sustainable manner can be effective only if
there are systemic reforms to Indonesia's accountability,procurement and financial management
framework. Government has indicated its commitment to take steps in this area (para. 69).
Besides strengthening its own fiduciary controls, the Bank will condition its lending levels and
access to additional IDA on progress in strengthening of public procurement and financial
management systems.
61.
The Bank Group program involves close cooperation with the Bank's development
partners based on comparative strength, proactive portfolio management with enhanced
fiduciary controls, a high-quality program of analytical and advisory activities focused on
key areas of reform and risk management, and a flexible lending program with strong
poverty focus. The CAS program, instruments and assistance scenarios are elaborated in the
following sections. Table 3.1 provides an overview of the CAS program components and related
Bank instruments and lead partners. A CAS program matrix is shown in Annex B9.

PARTNERSHIPS AND SELECTIVITY

62.
The Bank Group is increasingly pursuing partnership arrangements based on
strategic fit and comparative advantage. This allows the Bank Group much greater selectivity
in terms of areas of concentration, while drawing on its partners' skills and expertise to provide
the broad overview of the development process that is supported by the Bank's central aid
coordination function. In Indonesia, as elsewhere, the Bank Group continues to pursue a multilayered partnership strategy. Managing these partnerships is resource-intensive, but the payoff
for the Bank Group is a leveraging of its resources, and the sharing of knowledge and expertise,
and access to civil society that the Bank Group on its own would find difficult to achieve.
63.
As chair of the CGI, the Bank works closely with most of Indonesia's major
development partners who rely on the Bank's analytical work and its close relation with
Government to provide them the framework for assistance. In the rapidly changing development
context of Indonesia, this implies not just the annual CGI meeting but also regular meetings in
Jakarta, including a mid-year informal review of progress on CGI commitments. The CGI itself
has evolved into a focused discussion on a range of key issues (e.g., structural reform, poverty
reduction, governance, decentralization, forestry), typically led by donor partners with the Bank
facilitating, but not leading, the process.
64.
In support of the Government's economic recovery program, the Bank works closely
with the IMF and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the context of Government's Extended
Arrangement with the IMF. The IMF takes the lead on macroeconomic policy, while the Bank
takes the lead on structural and social policies (including corporate restructuring and sectoral
policy). ADB is the lead agency on privatization and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, and
SME development. All three institutions share joint responsibility for support of bank
restructuring and financial sector reforms. The Bank works closely with the IMF and ADB in
preparing the LOI for the Extended Arrangement.
65.
In support of the Government's medium-termdevelopment program, the Bank Group
partnerships are again multi-layered:
* Sectoral partnerships: A range of partnerships have emerged in a number of areas, such as
governance, decentralization, SME development, competition policy, water resource sector
reform and forestry. Each has lead donors and a concerted effort to coordinate donor program
and policies in support of a common set of objectives agreed with and sometimes led by
Indonesian stakeholders. Perhaps the most ambitious and innovative of these is the
Indonesian-led Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia, an initiative of the UNDP,
the World Bank Group and the ADB, which is intended to support Indonesia's transition to a
democratic decentralized society by facilitating a national dialogue on governance issues

33
aimed at bolstering the demands for reforn, with funding to support innovative governance
reform.15

* Major lenders: Official lending in support of Indonesia's development priorities is
dominated by three agencies: Japan's JBIC, ADB and the World Bank Group. These three
agencies work closely together to ensure consistency in approach and policy stance. The
Bank has pulled back from areas where it no longer has a comparative advantage and
strategic fit, such as parastatal-led infrastructure investment projects in power and
telecommunications,which were a big part of the Bank Group's pre-crisis lending. Japan is
still a player, while the Bank Group complements this role through advice to Government on
its policy and regulatory framework for infrastructure. The Bank and ADB work together on
joint sectoral approaches and in some cases joint documentation (e.g., basic education). The
Bank, ADB and JBIC work closely on the period Country Portfolio Performance Reviews
(CPPRs) with Government, and the three lenders are coordinating closely to manage the
fiduciary risk reviews posed by decentralization.
* Policy dialogue: The more important, established bilateral donors look to the Bank Group to
take the lead on the overall policy dialogue and seek to complement the Bank Group's role
through strategically directed technical assistance on grant terms, thus filling a gap in the
Bank Group's arsenal. They support the Bank Group's policy work through consultant trust
funds and occasional secondment of staff to the Bank Group office in Jakarta.
*

Cofinancing:Some donors (most notably the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) do not
wish to maintain a large aid presence in Jakarta but are conscientiously choosing to cofinance, on grant terms, the Bank Group's operations, thus softening the overall terms the
Bank Group offers. These donors work particularly closely with the Bank Group and have
been most supportive in stretching the Bank Group's AAA resources.

*

Partnerships with smaller agencies: The smaller agencies, such as UNICEF, see the Bank
Group as a partner who allows them to marry their local knowledge and expertise with an
ability to scale up their activity. These agencies and foundations are keen to work with the
Bank Group because they see us amplifying their voices on policy issues and providing them
a frameworkwithin which they are able to operate.

66.
The CAS program will more systematically exploit synergies within the Bank
Group, particularly in private sector development. Bank and IFC activities in Indonesia are
now managed by a joint Director who coordinates private sector development activities. This
provides for greater scope in exploiting synergies between policy and transactions, such as
applying the lessons from IFC's corporate experience in the Bank's work on developing the
policy and regulatory frameworks across the sectors in which the Bank is active, for example in
15

Under the partnership, a Facility houses a small number of national and intemational experts who facilitate an
Indonesian-led national dialogue on issues of governance that is informed by surveys, strategic thinking and
research, and sharing of international best practices; A Governance Fund, which has attracted bilateral donor
support ($25 million) for innovative governance reform proposals from civil society and governmnentagencies.
These two vehicles function under the direction of an Indonesian-led Board of Governors shared by two
prominent advocates of governancereform.

34
banking, legal reform, corporate restructuring and governance, infrastructure and the social
sectors. While the Bank will focus on policy and institutional reforms, IFC will invest in priority
areas-taking steps to avoid any conflict of interest that may arise. Financial sector, SMEs and
mining are good examples. IFC may invest in existing and new financial institutions and
strengthen management, credit analysis, risk management. In SMEs, IFC is looking for
opportunities to help set up a decentralized SME facility for SME services, and to invest in
financial intermediaries serving SMEs. In mining, based on its experience with the Business
Partnership for Development, the Bank is looking at strengthening capacity at local and regional
levels to develop and enforce environmental regulations, and facilitating partnerships and
procedures to set up mechanisms for dispute resolution. IFC in turn could invest in
environmentally and socially sustainable mining operations. Within the Group, the Foreign
Investment Advisory Group (FIAS) and MIGA focus on strengthening foreign investment
services at the regional level in the context of decentralization.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

67.
Portfolio management will focus on continued quality improvement and further
strengthening of fiduciary controls. The Bank's portfolio will continue to decline in size as
more projects are closed than are added. By FY03, we expect our portfolio to stabilize at around
50 to 55-Aown from 66 projects at end-FYOO(including GEF operations). In view of
decentralization, the Bank will be adjusting implementation arrangements with related capacity
strengthening in ongoing projects that will operate in the newly decentralized government
structure (e.g., basic education and health projects). The Bank will continue to seek quality
improvements and emphasize fiduciary oversight in its portfolio through: (a) proactive
management of problem projects; (b) restructuring of projects to maintain relevance and improve
performance; (c) increased thematic supervision to review systemic issues and enhance costeffectiveness of supervision work across projects in a sector or region; (d) improved readiness
for implementation to avoid start-up delays;16 and (e) attention to fiduciary controls related to
procurement and financial management. The Bank will intensify its work with ADB and JBIC on
common approaches to portfolio management as an extension of the joint CPPR work started in
FY00. Improvements in portfolio perfonnance during the CAS period are expected to be modest
because of the fluidity of the overall environment and uncertainty and challenges caused by the
forthcoming decentralization.The portfolio quality targets are shown in Table 3.2.

Implementation readiness is judged by a combination of factors, including (1) performance indicators being in
place; (2) firm arrangements in place for implementation funding; (3) completion of plans and financing
arrangements for any land acquisition and resettlement; (4) establishment and staffing of project
implementation units; (5) procurement and financial management/audit arrangements in place; (6) completion
of procurement documents for first-year implementation.

35
68.
Actions to strengthen fiduciary controls in procurement and financial management
include steps at the national level and at the level of the Bank's portfolio. Portfolio
management in Indonesia will remain challenging because of continued downside risks
associated with macroeconomic performance, inadequate project management and governance,
limited monitoring and evaluation capabilities, ineffective fiduciary functions (procurement,
financial management, internal controls and reporting), and the huge decentralization agenda.
The Bank also realizes that the deep-seated nature of corruption in Indonesia will make
strengthening of fiduciary controls a long-term challenge and managing large fiduciary risks to
Bank-financed projects will require constant attention. Also, decentralization if not well
managed on fiduciary standards at the local level can pose fiduciary fragmentation and
divergence, which will pose severe control risks and result in unnecessary costs. Building on the
results of the CPAR and CFAA work in FYOO-01and of a recent high-level Bank mission to
review Indonesia's fiduciary control environment, the Bank will support Government efforts
toward the preparation and implementation of action plans to strengthen the weak financial
management and procurement systems.
69.
At the CGI meeting in Tokyo, the Government made specific commitments to
reform the public procurement and financial management systems along the lines of the
CPAR and CFAA. These steps are outlined in Box 3. 1, along with an overview of the fiduciary
environment and the strategy to protect Bank-financed projects. Satisfactory progress in reform
of these systems has been built in as triggers for future Bank lending (see para. 80). This includes
immediate steps to ensure for the base case lending program that same fiduciary standards for
public procurement and financial management are applied at provincial and district levels, as at
the national level. Maintaining uniform standards for procurement and financial management
will require a revision of current government regulations related to implementation of the
decentralizationprogram. In order to develop a sound fiduciary environment, these actions will
need to be complemented by reforms in the overall governance system, including reforms in
legal and judicial systems, civil service reform and the overall accountability structure. These
efforts are supported by the Bank's work on governancereform (para. 46).
70.
IFC has been able to turn around its portfolio hit by the crisis, by way of intensive
restructuring and recapitalizing of its existing client companies. As in other crisis-affected
countries, IFC has worked on restructuring of its existing client companies. IFC's portfolio
included 14 problem projects with total exposure of $364 million ($138 million A loans, $43
million equity, and $183 million B loans), representing about 43 percent of IFC's total exposure
in Indonesia. IFC completed four major restructuring projects for a total $135 million, or about
42 percent of the problem loan portfolio. Only one portfolio company has been put into
liquidation proceedings as a result of other creditors taking legal action. IFC will continue to
follow up on these efforts in protecting its portfolio.
71.
MIGA's portfolio in Indonesia was affected by a claim from one of its projects. As a
result, MIGA has -suspended its guarantee activities in Indonesia. As soon as it has settled
handling of the claim with Government, MIGA will resume cover in Indonesia.

37
ANALYTICALAND ADVISORYACTIVITIES

72.
The Bank is rebuilding its AAA program with heavy emphasis on advisory
activities, a small but growing body of analytical work, and increased attention to regional
issues. The main components of the program are shown in Annex B4. In the "muddle-through"
base-case scenario, the Bank will retain a high level of advisory activities on immediate policy
issues in:
* Bank and corporate restructuring: The Bank's intensive involvement in this key area
must be maintained. Not to do so would invite a large reputational risk for the Bank Group.
* Development of a poverty strategy: The Bank's draft paper contributing to a Govermment
poverty strategy will feed into the development of a poverty strategy backed by a multistakeholder consultation process. This would also involve assistance for Government's
preparation of a PRSP in FY02 (para 17).
* High-priority public procurement and financial management reforms: Based on
ongoing work in public procurement and assessment of the government financial system, the
Bank will advise on key initial steps in setting up a public procurement agency, on revisions
of the draft Laws on State Finance, Treasury and Audit, currently in Parliament, and on
safeguardingpublic finances in a decentralized environment (para. 69).
73.
The Bank's AAA program will also include components of a medium-term nature,
such as:
*

Governance: The Bank's recent work on fiscal decentralization, civil service reform,
financial management, and corporate governance should be considered only the first step in a
long-term engagement with these issues-involving advisory activities supported by
analyticalwork.

* Implementation of the poverty strategy: Preparation of the poverty strategy in the short
term will need to be followed up with support for its implementation, especially at the
regional level. The Bank will also continue its agricultural policy dialogue, which it
considers a key component of a broad-basedpoverty strategy.
* Analytical work at the regional level: Work will be undertaken to develop a better
understanding of local institutions, local capacity, public expenditure programs, fiduciary
environment and the quality of public service delivery to the poor. This work will be
undertaken by cross-sectoral teams that engage with sub-national governments, civil society
groups , the private sector, and local communities. It will be aimed at developing a new
generation of lending operations at sub-national level that embody demand-responsive
policies and public service delivery as outlined in the previous section (para. 51).
* Design and implementation of a long-term financial sector strategy: The current focus
on bank restructuring will now need to make way for a broader and more medium-term
reform of the entire financial sector, including non-bank financial institutions, the capital
market, rural financial intermediation, and micro-finance.

38
Long-term development prospects: The Bank intends to initiate a joint work program with
Indonesian policy and research institutions and its international development partners to help
Indonesia prepare a long-term view of its development prospects focusing, among others, on
agriculture, environment, health, education, urban and spatial issues. The Bank's role will
primarily be one of facilitator and intellectual interlocutor, while the leadership will come
from Indonesian institutions supported by trust funds.
74.
The Bank is building a strategic partnership with the World Bank Institute (WBI)
focused on governance and capacity building but also including poverty and forestry. WBI
will support the Bank's substantive agenda in a few key areas (governance/anticorruption,
decentralization, forestry reform), help access the new technology-based global learning
networks that the Bank is developing, and access learning programs for external audiences (such
as parliamentarians, think tanks, civil society).
LENDING PROGRAM, TRIGGERS AND INSTRUMENTS

75.
The base case lending program could return investment lending to less than one
third of pre-crisis levels. In the "muddle-through" base-case scenario, lending would be up to
$400 million a year, as compared with average lending of about $1.3 billion a year during FY9097. This would include Indonesia's current IDA-12 allocation of SDR300 million (about $400
million), and assumes continued IDA access beyond FY02. If Indonesia's IDA allocation were to
be maintained at the level of IDA-12, this would result in an average 65:35 IBRD/IDA blend
during the CAS period. Any proposals for an IDA allocation beyond the IDA-12 period (FY0002) would be considered within the context of the IDA-13 replenishment. Minimum conditions
for the base case would be maintenance of macroeconomic stability, including prudent debt
management and progress on asset sales and privatization, minimum fiduciary safeguards for
delivery of public services with decentralization, and establishment of organizational
arrangements, scope, process, and schedule for developing a broad-based poverty reduction
strategy. Specifics of these minimum conditions are shown in Table 3.4 below. Lending would
be for projects in health, education, basic infrastructure, and community development. The types
of poverty-oriented projects in the base case are expected to be reasonably resilient as long as
macroeconomicconditions remain stable. No adjustment lending is foreseen in the base case.
76.
The CAS also anticipates possible "crisis" scenarios. As indicated above, the base case
scenario is expected to involve considerable volatility in policy and institutional performance. A
breakdown in Government's Extended Arrangement with the IMF as a result of major policy
slippage, including inadequate progress on bank and corporate restructuring, could lead to a
rapid erosion of market confidence and deterioration in economic conditions. A similar outcome
could result from political instability or a widespread breakdown in law and order. In these
adverse situations, the Bank would cease all new lending until base case conditions have been
restored. In the event of another macroeconomic shock, e.g., from lower world oil prices, slower
global growth, or volatility in internationalcapital markets, the Bank may be asked to contribute
to an international rescue effort with additional adjustment lending or support to crisis-response
programs. However, the Bank's response this time around would be limited by Indonesia's high
debt burden, as well as IBRD's high exposure in Indonesia (para. 89).

39

77.
The Bank is prepared to move to a higher lending case, if policy performance
improves ("performance" scenario). The change in government has offered significant
opportunities for fundamental reform. The Bank is working with Government in the various
areas of structural and governance reform, and in developing a poverty strategy. In case reforms
accelerate, and in line with Government's request, the Bank is prepared to raise lending to about
$1 billion per year from FY02. In such a scenario, increased investment financing needs for basic
infrastructure services (urban and rural) are envisaged as economic activity accelerates, besides
an accelerated expansion of community developmentand social sector programs given the higher
prospects for sustainability with a broad-based poverty strategy. A high performance
environment would allow for an earlier move toward programmatic lending-as early as FY02
for sectoral interventions (APLs for water and urban services). Indonesia would be eligible for
adjustmentlending in the high case, although it is unlikely to be needed given current budget and
balance of payments projections. The high-case program includes a small indicative amount of
adjustmentlending in FY01-02 (about $200 million a year) before it is phased out in later years.
78.
As part of the high case, the Bank would temporarily increase Indonesia's IDA
allocation. At the recent IDA Deputies meeting in Lisbon, Deputies broadly agreed that the
processes of reform and improving governance in Indonesia should be strongly supported,
including through enhanced IDA allocations as elaborated in the background note from staff.17 In
the meantime, Government has taken initial steps in the areas of poverty reduction and
governance reform. Based on adoption and sustained implementation of coherent action
programs in these areas, the Bank would increase Indonesia's current IDA share by about
US$200 million a year over the period FYO1-03.In the high case, the average IBRD/IDA blend
would be about 60:40 over the CAS period. The lending scenarios in the base case and the high
case are shown in Table 3.3.

Indonesia's IDA eligibility would be on a temporary basis. The reforms supported by
the higher IDA allocation would boost prospects for an accelerated economic recovery and

Assistance Strategy," circulated to the deputies on May 24, 2000.

enable Indonesia's return to full market access. Indonesia is expected to phase out from IDA as
economic growth gains momentum and its per capita GNP surpasses again the IDA threshold
($885 for IDA-12). Based on current projections this is not likely to happen for another four to
six years. Using current market sentiments as a guide and the increased uncertainties, Indonesia
is more likely to surpass the IDA threshold before it regains the status of a high-creditworthy
borrower with full market access.
80.
The high-case lending scenario is conditioned on a set of upfront reform actions plus
continued progress in key reform areas monitored by regular policy performance
assessments. For the high case, upfront actions involve a set of key Government actions in two
broad areas-macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, and governance and poverty
strategy. In the first area, Government will need to take actions aimed at improving
macroeconomic performance, accelerating bank and corporate restructuring, implementing its
privatization plan, and setting a medium-term direction of rice policy. The Bank will continue to
use the LOI as the primary instrument to assess progress on macroeconomic stability, bank and
corporate restructuring, and privatization (also see para. 81). Upfront actions in these areas will
comprise agreement on the appropriate policies and targets in the LOI. In the second area, key
conditions for the high case involve Government actions to strengthen public procurement and
financial management systems, and to initiate preparation of a broad-based poverty reduction
strategy based on multi-stakeholder consultations. These upfront actions for the high-case
lending scenario are elaborated in Table 3.4 below.
81.
The Bank will undertake regular semiannual policy assessments with Government
to determine continued eligibility for the high case and to set performance targets for the
next six months. Given the difficulty of setting upfront annual lending triggers for the CAS
period in Indonesia's uncertain environment, these semiannual policy assessments will provide
the basis to judge whether Indonesia qualifies for the high case scenario. The findings of the
review would be made available to the semi-annual CGI meetings for review by the Government
with the donor community. A satisfactory outcome of the review would mean that Indonesia
would be eligible for enhanced financial support from IBRD and IDA. Alternatively, if policy
actions fall short of agreed targets, Indonesia's eligibility will be revisited after six months.
These semiannual reviews provide the Bank and the Government a benchmark against which to
judge progress and a regular vehicle to discuss structural and social reforms. As part of these
reviews, the Bank will continue to use the LOI as the primary instrument to assess progress in
the areas of macroeconomic performance, bank and corporate restructuring and privatization.
Over time, as the scope of the LOI narrows, the Bank will review with Government the
feasibility to move toward a letter of development policy which would outline Government's
agreed commitments for social and structural reform not covered in the LOI.
82.
The Bank lending program foresees a mix of investment projects that respond to its
poverty focus and that would provide flexibility to respond to changing circumstances.The
program's core investment projects would support delivering better public services to the poor
through local governments that have demonstrated reform and community empowerment to
reach the poor. Project focus would include: (1) comnmunity-baseddevelopment programs (the
recent Kecamatan development and urban poverty projects provide good exarnples); (2) human
development (sub-national programs in health and education); and (3) basic infrastructure (urban
and rural). In addition, investment projects would support pro-poor policies for quality growth,

where appropriate (land administration and access to micro-finance). Particularly in a high case
scenario, the Bank intends to use Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) increasingly at the subnational level, rewarding those regions which undertake pro-poor reforms-both sectoral and
broad-based public sector reforrn toward transparent, accountable government. Such
programmatic lending is expected to have the largest poverty reduction impact by targeting
provinces and districts whose leaders have already taken pro-poor, pro-growth reform measures
(para. 54). This would require sub-national administrative institutions to be functioning in a
satisfactory manner-including maintenance of minimum fiduciary standards. A possible public

42
sector reform loan/credit is contemplated at the national level to help strengthen central
government capacity in a post-decentralizationera.
83.
As decentralization proceeds, Bank funds will be increasingly onlent to sub-national
governments. Although the Bank is still discussing the regulatory framework with Govermment,
it is likely that its lending will continue to be to the central government. Onlending will probably
take place on terms that reflect the borrowing costs to the central government as well as the
financial capacity of the local government. The average cost-sharing ratio in future projects
(three-year rolling average) would be kept at the 75/25 ratio for IDA blend countries. The Bank
will consider front-loading of disbursement percentages in individual projects if necessary in
view of possible counterpart funds constraints at local levels in the early stages of
decentralization.
84.
Beyond the restructuring of its existing clients, IFC will focus on interventions with
strong demonstration effects and positive impact on market perceptions. IFC has
commissioneda study to identify candidates for restructuring assistance. These projects typically
combine financial, operational and managerial restructuring, using a variety of instruments
loan/equity, quasi-equity and technical assistance. In addition to individual transactions, IFC is
exploring ways to leverage its limited resources at wholesale level through specialized
investment funds to respond to the urgent needs for equity capital in the corporate sector. As part
of IFC's crisis response, the Corporation will explore opportunities to help the restructuring
process with the recapitalization of private banks, establishment of restructuring funds or other
specialized institutions, investments in individual financial institutions, attracting strategic
partners where possible, and complementing its investments with capacity building through
technical assistance and twinning arrangements. A longer-term objective is to assist the
deepening of the Indonesian financial sector through institution building in housing finance and
mortgage-based securities products, securitization, corporate bond markets, and e-banking. In
addition, IFC is preparing a second trade enhancement facility to respond to urgent needs.
85.
In support of SME development, IFC intends to mobilize donor funds to finance a
decentralized SME facility to provide a range of services, and build financial infrastructure for
SMEs such as credit bureaus. It is looking for opportunities to invest in financial intermediaries
focusing on SMEs and micro-enterprises. It is also exploring investment opportunities in
resource-based industries, particularly oil and gas, and mining. Finally, IFC is interested to
promote private participation in infrastructure in areas where regulatory structures are
developing and where development needs are acute, such as water and transport. In a base case
scenario, IFC's new business in Indonesia is expected to be in the order of $140 to 180 million a
year for IFC's own account. In a high case, the level could be in the order of $220 million a year
for IFC's own account.
86.
IFC's investment scenarios would be affected by progress in key reform areas. IFC
activity level would depend on: (a) progress on developing the bankruptcy and legal regime for
protecting creditor rights; (b) progress on corporate governance (transparency and minority
investor rights); (c) further openings in the FDI regime; and (d) the depth of corporate
restructurings in terms of meaningful financial and operational restructuring taking place. A
satisfactory resolution to the issue of IFC's tax immunities will be critical to its ability to
continue operations in Indonesia.

43
CIVIL SOCIETY OUTREACH

87.
The Bank will continue to extend efforts to engage civil society. Since the crisis, the
Bank has engaged a much more active and vocal civil society. It had to answer to persistent
questions that its association with the previous regime contributed to high levels of debt and
corruption. Considerable time was spent with members of the NGO community to review aspects
of the Bank's program and discuss their concerns. The recent CAS consultations provided a good
forum to discuss the Bank's role in Indonesia and explain its position on these issues (para. 31).
Following the Kecamatan DevelopmentProject and social safety net adjustment loan models, the
Bank is also building in civil society monitoring of project implementation. The new generation
of demand-responsive projects would create much greater scope for involvement of all
stakeholders in project design and implementation. The Bank has invited interested
representatives to look at a sample of projects for ways to reduce possible corruption. Following
up on the civil society consultations, the Bank is open to an arrangement for a consortium of
"anticorruption" NGOs to act as watchdog over the use of funds in Bank projects, and to work
with regional councils comprised of civil society and local government and civil society, to
monitor projects during both planning and implementation. In view of the diversity of the NGO
community in Indonesia, it may take some time for such a consortium to emerge. The Bank has
also increased its disclosure of information and has recently launched a new external website.
The Jakarta-based Public Information Center is becoming more proactive in dissemination and
outreach, and the Bank is considering establishment of small regional information centers in
selected provinces. The media are used more actively in explaining the Bank's position, and the
Bank speaks out more openly when it differs from government positions. The Bank has also
developed closer ties with an active Parliament and its relevant committees. If anything, these
efforts will need to be intensifiedto maintain the Bank Group's relevance in the new Indonesia.
PROGRESS MONITORING

88.
The Bank intends to monitor country progress against poverty reduction indicators
once they are agreed in the Government's broad-based poverty reduction strategy.
Indonesia's historic approach to poverty overemphasized numerical targets, leaving many
important dimensions of poverty and well-being unaddressed (para. 9). But giving up on goals
would not be appropriate: without goals consensus in measuring progress would not be possible.
To help ensure that progress is being made on the broader concept of poverty, the Bank's draft
poverty report suggests a new set of objectives,but emphasizes that goals should be set as part of
the process of creating a poverty strategy which should be open to dialogue and debate among
the stakeholders. Table 3.5 gives details of these possible poverty reduction goals to be attained
by 2004. On the headcount of expenditure poverty, the proposed goal would reduce the
headcount to a slightly lower level than that achieved pre-crisis-halving the headcount from the
peak reached during the crisis. Based on CAS review feedback, the goals for "human
investment" and "infrastructure access" poverty measures have been scaled back somewhat from
the poverty report-given likely setbacks in these areas during the transition to decentralization.
These possible goals aim to advance by 2004 the bottom fifth of Indonesian's population (below
the 20t percentile by wealth or expenditure) to levels of human investment and access to basic
infrastructure,which have been achieved by the those in the lower-middle income strata (20t to
40 th percentiles). The Bank is also working with the Government to find ways to measure and

44
track "social poverty," including the number of poor and women who participate fully in
community life and in local political decisions that affect their lives.

BANKEXPOSURE
ANDRISKMANAGEMENT

89.
Bank exposure. By end-FYOO,Indonesia's outstanding debt to IBRD was about $11.8
billion-one of IBRD's three largest. This is lower that had been foreseen in the CAS Progress
Report, but remains close to the Bank's concentration limit of $13.5 billion for single large
borrowers. Net IBRD disbursements, which are likely to be positive this year, will turn negative
in the years to come, offset at least partly by net IDA flows (see Table 3.6 below). Even in the
high case this will be so from FY03. This is appropriatein view of the authorities' desire to limit
Indonesia's indebtedness, the Bank's greater focus on IDA lending and the sharp deterioration in
Indonesia's creditworthiness for IBRD borrowing compared to before the 1997/98 crisis. In the
base case, IBRD's exposure will fall to around $10.7 billion by the end of FY03 and in the high
case would reduce only marginally to $11.2 billion. Indonesia's continued high level of exposure
would pose very serious costs to IBRD's net income and balance sheet in the event that
Indonesia's precarious creditworthiness led to non-accrual during the CAS period.
90.
Financial risks. The financial risks to EBRDin Indonesia remain substantial during the
CAS period. By end-2000, total external debt service was estimated to be 40 percent of exports
of goods and services, and is projected to exceed 30 percent throughout the CAS period-even
after the reschedulings so far agreed, particularly by the Paris Club. Also at the end of 2000,
Indonesia's total external debt to both GDP and exports-at an estimated 102 percent and 278
percent, respectively-was considerably higher than the average for other IBRDIIDA blend
borrowers-74 percent of GDP and 199 percent of exports respectively, leaving the country
vulnerable to new shocks. Further details of key exposure indicators are shown in Annex B7.
Debt service to IBRD is projected to breach the exposure guideline of 20 percent of total debt

45
service to preferred creditors in 2003. The share of preferred creditors as a whole in public debt
service is also projected to remain high and to breach the guideline of 35 percent in 2001-03,
reflecting large payments coming due to the IMF.18 It should be noted that these ratios in
Indonesia's case are sensitive to oil prices. The generally high level of prices in the past year will
have been helpful, but Indonesia remains vulnerable to any renewed slippage in oil prices,
especially if this results from a more general slowdown in world trade growth, which would hurt
Indonesia's non-oil exports at the same time and shrink the current surplus more quickly.19

Country risks. As elaborated in the CAS, the Bank Group's assistance strategy in
Indonesia is subject to high uncertainty and risk. Broadly, the following major country risks may
be foreseen: (1) increasing political turmoil that may lead to a disintegration of the current
government and possible further moves to impeach the President; (2) increasing political
interference in the reform process, particularly in bank restructuring and sale of state assets; (3)
increasing limitations in administrative capacity and government leadership-in part brought on
by the complex decentralizationprogram-which would result in further delays in the economic
program and reform, and would adversely affect the implementation environment of Bank Group
projects; (4) an escalation of regional demands for independence, which may lead to further
social turmoil and would affect the ability for coherent macroeconomic (especially fiscal) and

46
structural policies; (5) growing nationalistic sentiments, which may affect policies and lead to
political pressure for limiting Bank Group involvement; and (6) a less favorable external
environment caused by more rapid decline in oil prices, or slowdown in world trade. These risks,
individually or in combination, may threaten more broadly the prospects for restoring
macroeconomic stability and growth by jeopardizing companies' ability to increase output and
investment, by leaving banks weak and unable to provide financial intermediation, and by
undermining fiscal and monetary control which could leave debt levels high, discourage inflows
of private foreign capital and lead to fresh strains on the rupiah, reserves and debt-servicing
capacity.
92.
The CAS takes account of these risks. The CAS is built around uncertainty and risk.
The base case is based on conservative lending levels compared to earlier years, and the Bank
would be ready to cease all lending in case macroeconomicor political stability is threatened or
fiduciary standards deteriorate. The Bank would focus lending on poverty-oriented projects,
which are expected to be more resilient to changes in macroeconomic and political conditions.
Adjustment lending is only foreseen in a high-case scenario and would be phased out by FY02.
AAA is focused on areas where risks are the highest and the potential to lower them the
greatest-such as fiscal decentralization,civil service reforms, judicial reforms, government debt
management, and public expenditure management. The Bank would also strengthen other risk
mitigating measures, such as: (a) continued intelligence gathering on social and political risks;
(b) more emphasis on regular contingencyplanning; and (c) improved risk analysis in new loans.

INDONESIA
SUMMARY OF WORLD BANK GROUP
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY'
Overview
The level of poverty in Indonesia and the vulnerability of the poor will not be
permanently reduced without sustained, broad based economic recovery and growth. This growth
can only be generated and sustained by private activity. But past patterns of development
contributed to the onset, the severity and the length of the financial and economic crisis.
Indonesia's potential will not be realized without a pattern of private sector activity that is very
different from the past. Indonesia cannot afford to miss the opportunity offered by the crisis to
make fundamental changes in the business environment and in the way business is done.
Indonesia's large corporations account for 60 percent of GDP. But 99.5 percent of
employment is in enterprises with less than 100 employees. The small and medium enterprise
sector is highly underdeveloped. The result of this is a lost productive potential from a "missing
middle" group of enterprises that in more economically developed countries is the driving force
for development. With the top ten families owning more than 60 percent of the corporate assets,
ownership concentration in Indonesia is higher than in other countries in the region. Close
relationships between corporations, banks and government, poor oversight by the regulators,
insider control and pervasive state ownership of economic assets have all acted against the
openness to competition and transparency that are necessary for sustainable growth and resilience
to shock.
The first priority should be for the banking and corporate sectors to speed up the
resolution of the corporate debt overhang so that financial flows for investment and working
capital can resume. Secondly, the many structural inefficiencies that led to the crisis and made it
deeper and longer lasting in Indonesia than elsewhere in Asia need to be overcome. Reforms are
needed to enable Indonesia to become a modern market economy and avoid future crises. This
means fighting corruption in the public administration and ensuring the rule of law through the
court system, reinforcing property rights and dispute resolution mechanisms, ensuring open and
transparent transactions through more competition and better corporate governance, and creating
a business environment where following the rules rather than crony capitalism is the norm. The
state needs to withdraw transparently from its over-extended ownership of productive assets and
allow the private sector to realize its potential as the driving force for growth. But at the same
time the state has to step up and take on its legitimate oversight role by strengthening the rules,
and the institutions that enforce them. This means improving supervision of the banks and
financial markets, creating independent regulators for public monopolies, developing and
enforcing competition law, and enforcing financial disclosure and audit of financial institutions
and public corporations. Thirdly, measures to ensure that the necessary growth is broad based
and sustainable will be necessary. This means firstly removing the current obstacles to small and
medium enterprise activity and promoting SME development. It also means building the
necessary physical and social infrastructure and ensuring that growth is environmentally
sustainable, particularly for Indonesia's forests, mineral and marine resources. Finally, Indonesia
will need to create the infrastructure and regulatory environment necessary to take full advantage
of the new information and communicationstechnologies.

The private sector was hit hard by the crisis
The crisis had a devastating impact on the corporate sector, particularly in construction,
financial services and manufacturing. The corporates had depended excessively on foreign
borrowing and very little on equity finance. In late 1997 a large part of the corporate and banking
sector became insolvent. Small enterprises, the majority of which are in agriculture, suffered less
than the corporate sector as they were not as exposed to the devaluation of the rupiah. They did,
however suffer from the decline in aggregate demand resulting from the crisis.
GDP recovered and grew by 4-5 percent over the year to the third quarter of 2000. The
incipient recovery was relatively well spread across the sectors, with investment gaining
importance over consumption, and non-oil exports contributing substantially. But the financial
markets have not yet recovered, due mainly to continued concerns about political instability and
regional violence and delays in corporate restructuring. The stock market in December 2000 had
lost one third of its value since December 1999. Since the start of the crisis 68 out of 237 banks
have been closed, and another 12 banks nationalized in an effort to stabilize the banking system.
As the banking sector begins to emerge, the Government is directly in control of 70 percent of the
deposits in the banking system, compared to 40 percent in Korea, and 23 percent in Thailand. The
bank recapitalization program has been extremely costly. A total of about Rp 650 trillion of
sovereign bonds have been issued and this to recapitalize the banks only to a capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) of 4 percent. Bank lending is resuming, up just under 6 percent in the first half of
2000 compared with the previous year, but lending is mostly for short term working capital rather
than for investment. Large non-performning loan portfolios are still holding back bank
profitability.
Indonesian corporate debt in late 2000 is around $117 billion - 70 percent of this is for
large private corporations and 30 percent for state-owned enterprises and SMEs. Of the total, 48
percent is owed to foreign creditors and more than 70 percent is denominated in foreign
currencies. Around 49 percent of corporate debt is distressed. Of the large corporate debt, threequarters is distressed and in need of restructuring. After a very late start, corporate debt
restructuring began to pick up towards the end of 1999. Around $15 billion in distressed
corporate debt has been restructured since the crisis began, and most of that during the year 2000.
A number of large debt restructuring deals are imminent and both creditors and debtors are
cautiously optimistic that, barring unforeseen problems, the momentum will continue.
There are many impediments to robust recovery and sustainable growth
Banking and corporate restructuring. Sustainable economic growth cannot begin until
banking and corporate debt restructuring have made substantial progress, and there is a long way
to go. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency's (IBRA) intemal governance needs
improvement and IBRA's last two annual audits included disclaimers of opinion. Following
some recent high profile transactions involving well connected conglomerates, the quality of
IBRA's restructuring deals is currently being questioned and there is an urgent need for IBRA to
adopt transparent debt restructuring principles, especially for its largest obligors. The slow speed
of divestiture of IBRA's assets is also causing concem not only because of the consequent delay
to the restructuring of the economy and but also because of the acute need for revenues from asset
sales to cover the cost of bank recapitalization. There are doubts about IBRA's and Govemment's
willingness to accept that realization from the assets to be sold will likely be much less than their
book value. The restructuring and privatization of Indonesia's state banks is an urgent priority for
the creation of a healthy banking system, but progress to date has been very slow.

CAS Annex 1
Page 3 of 5
In addition to the high profile cases, there are also concerns about the quality of many of
the other corporate restructuring deals concluded to date. They have relied excessively on term
extensions and debt equity conversions. Little real operational restructuring has taken place and
the risk is that many corporates could remain vulnerable to future crisis even after restructuring.
The bankruptcy process in Indonesia does not pose a credible threat to recalcitrant debtors and
much effort has gone into devising ways of getting around this, including granting IBRA
extraordinary powers to seize assets and giving the voluntary debt restructuring agency, JITF,
additional leverage to refer non-cooperative debtors to the Ministerial Committee, FSPC, for
referral on to the Attorney General. These measures have yet to be seriously tested, however and
it remains to be seen whether they will be effective. Meanwhile some progress has been made in
offering tax and regulatory incentives to parties concluding debt restructuring deals. Further
implementingrules are needed to make these measures fully effective.
Structural weaknesses. Restructuring the banks and resolving the debt overhang are only
the first steps. Action needs to be taken to remove a formidable range of structural impediments
and constraints to sustainable and equitable economic growth. These cannot be resolved
overnight but action to deal with them needs to begin and be sustained over time. These
impediments fall into several broad categories:
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

Poor governanceand corruption in the public sector;
The uncertainties surrounding the forthcoming decentralization process;
The absence of an effective court system and the longstanding need for legal and judicial
reform;
Poor corporate governance, particularly lack of information disclosure or enforcement
against offenders;
The need for effective rules and institutions to implement competition policy;
A less than welcoming climate for foreign direct investment; and
The extended role of the state and its crowding out of private sector activity.

Impediments to long term sustainable development. Broad based growth cannot happen
without development of the SME sector. At present SMEs face a number of impediments
including market distortions acting against them, excessive regulation, corruption and red tape,
ineffective support systems, low skills development and a banking system that lacks the capacity
or skills to lend to SMEs. Rural areas in particular remain underdeveloped as public sector
delivery systems have not provided farmers with effective services or access to micro-finance.
The effectiveness of attempts to privatize physical infrastructure in the 1990s were
limited by lack of independent regulation, by lack of competitive market structures and by lack of
transparency in many of the deals that were concluded. One consequence is the frequency of
high profile contractual disputes between the public utilities and their private partners.
Governmentpolicies do not yet favor transparent privatization of infrastructure and frequently act
to crowd out new private investors. Similar considerations apply in the health and education
sectors where private providers frequently are able to reach poorer sections of the population that
the public providers do not reach, and in other cases are able to provide better quality services at
lower cost. But government policies have discriminated against private providers.
In forestry, the distorted incentive framework, irresponsible behavior by timber
companies and lack of enforcement of regulations against offenders has led to a crisis of illegal
logging which is threatening the very existence of Indonesia's forests.
Finally, Indonesia is lagging behind neighboring countries in embracing the new
information and communications technologies. The legal and regulatory framework for e-

CAS Annex 1
Page 4 of 5
commerce does not yet exist. Government itself has not used the new technologies to advantage.
Important opportunities are being missed, in terms of the possibilities of making existing business
more effective, of opportunities for creating completely new businesses, and of the benefits from
increased transparency that would accrue to the population from putting government on line and
using new electronic and communications applications in education and other public services.
World Bank Group Private Sector Development Strategy
The World Bank Group's (WBG's) vision and strategy for development of the private
sector responds closely to that recently elaborated in Government's ten point economic recovery
program. It is based on solid analysis of the conditions on the ground in Indonesia and
continuous dialogue with and feedback from beneficiaries, our partners in the private sector, in
government, and among the donors. To sharpen up the relevance and focus of this private sector
development strategy, the VVBG held discussions during its preparation with focus groups of
private entrepreneurs, and also commissioned a business environment survey of private
businesses in Indonesia.
The medium term vision is one in which, firstly, the immediate aftermath of the crisis will
have been resolved, with a healthy restructured banking sector lending again for corporate
investment and working capital. Secondly, progress will have been made in resolving the
structural impediments to private sector led growth mentioned above. Private activity would be
based mainly on competition and effectiveness rather than on protective relationships between
government, the banks and the corporate sector. Thirdly, the private sector will be playing the
leading role in generating growth and fiscal resources and providing the public infrastructure and
services needed for sustained poverty reduction. The ownership pattern would be less
concentrated than in the past, but more broadly based on accelerated development of SMEs and
broader share ownership in the large corporations.
The role of the WBG. The WBG is taking advantage of the synergies resulting from the
recently implemented co-management of Bank PSD and IFC activities in the East Asia Region
and the joint WB/IFC Global Product Groups. We are being selective in our interventions,
operating in catalytic mode, supporting activities for which there is a strong government or
partner commitment, a demonstrated country need and where we have a comparative advantage.
The WBG is maximizing opportunities to leverage its scarce resources with those of other
donors and investors and taking care to avoid duplication of activities. Private sector
development is a cross-sectoral objective and, where possible, PSD activities are being
mainstreamed through the Bank's sector projects and other interventions. In a few cases, such as
banking and corporate restructuring, corporate governance, competition policy, SME
development and information and communications technology, the WBG is implementing free
standing projects, trust fund grants or advisory activities.
Crisis response activities. The Bank has worked closely with the IMF and the ADB since
the onset of the crisis, in supporting government's banking and corporate restructuring program
and will continue to do so until the crisis is over, with technical assistance, lending, trust funds
and analytical and advisory activities (AAA). IFC is supporting corporate restructuring by
actively restructuring problem projects in its own portfolio and seeking out candidates for
demonstration restructuring transactions.
Addressing structural weaknesses. In the areas of public sector governance and
decentralization, the Bank is leveraging donor resources through the multi-donor Govemance
Partnership and through trust funds to provide advice to government and we propose to continue
this assistance as a priority. In legal and judicial reform the Bank is playing the role of

CAS Annex 1
Page 5 of 5
coordinator of donor activities in response to a request from the Government. Trust funds and a
component of a Bank project will also support training activities for Commercial Court personnel.
In corporate govemance, the Bank through its AAA is sponsoring seminars and other best
practice dissemination events. The Bank also proposes to complete a benchmarking exercise of
Indonesian corporate govemance practices during the coming year. IFC is applying corporate
govemance best practices through its role as a shareholder in a number of Indonesian
corporations. The Bank is taking the lead and coordinating among the donors in providing help to
the new competition agency. In promotion of foreign direct investment, FIAS has provided a
number of missions and is ready to respond to further requests. MIGA's operations in Indonesia
were affected by a claim from one of its projects. As a result, it has suspended its guarantee
activity in Indonesia, but it is accepting applications of interest and is keen to support the
resumption of FDI in Indonesia. In privatization, the Bank has played a key advisory role in the
past but there is little receptiveness from Govemment at present. The ADB now has the lead in
this area.
Promoting long term sustainable development. SME development in Indonesia is a
priority area of assistance for the new Joint Bank/IFC SME Unit. The WBG has supported a
variety of SME programs and projects over the years in Indonesia. The focus at present is on
policy advice, improved delivery of business development services through a decentralized SME
facility, and the building of capacity within banks to lend to SMEs. In rural and urban
development, the Bank will continue to promote private sector development through its sector
projects and IFC will work through investments in agribusiness. In infrastructure, the Bank will
continue to promote privatization and private participation through its ongoing sector projects in
telecommunications, power and transport. IFC is looking for opportunities to invest in the
transport and water sectors. The Bank will seek means of promoting the private provision of
social services in health and education through its sector projects and AAA advisory activities. In
forestry, the Bank has supported reforms through its policy based lending and is leading the forest
policy dialogue with government and other partners. The WBG is ready to invest in the oil, gas
and mining sectors, based on sound policy and regulatory frameworks. In mining, the emphasis
will be on small scale mining activities in a decentralized environment. In information and
communications technology, the Bank is supporting preparation of a national networking strategy
including upgrading of the regulatory framework for e-commerce and supporting government on
line initiatives.
