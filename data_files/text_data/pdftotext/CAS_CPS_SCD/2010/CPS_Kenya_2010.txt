Executive Summary
Country Partnership Strategy for Kenya 2010-13
i.
Kenya’s Development Challenges. Since 2003, Kenya has shown that it can make
significant development progress, but also that longstanding challenges continue to hold it back.
Following peaceful elections in 2002, the Government introduced free primary education,
achieved sustained economic growth, reduced poverty, and eliminated a lot of red tape, but at the
same time it failed to deal decisively with corruption, inequality, political disruption, and the
vulnerabilities that hold it back. In 2007-08, the disputed outcome of presidential elections
triggered widespread violence, resulting in about 1,100 deaths and the formation of a coalition
government. Post-election violence, together with drought, high global food and fuel prices, and
the global financial crisis, brought per capita growth below zero in both 2008 and 2009. Kenya
is now recovering from these setbacks, but once again the principal goal of its government and
its people—sustained high rates of per capita growth—is elusive. In addition, progress in
achieving the MDGs remains mixed (Kenya will miss the poverty and health MDGs, but may
reach the education one); about 50 percent of the population still lives in poverty; inequality is
high, with access to services varying widely by region and by gender; and poverty, inequality
and social exclusion have fueled crime and violence. Governance also remains a key challenge,
with Kenya scoring well on voice, regulatory quality, revenue mobilization, public
administration, and macroeconomic management, but very poorly on rule of law and control of
corruption.
ii.
The.Government’s Program. In mid-2008, the Government prepared a long-term
development strategy, Vision 2030, which aims to transform Kenya into a globally-competitive
middle-income country by 2030. The strategy has three pillars: an economic pillar that aims to
achieve GDP growth of 10 percent per annum; a social pillar that aims to build a just society
enjoying equitable social development in a clean and secure environment; and a political pillar
that aims to build a people-centered, results-oriented, accountable democratic political system.
To operationalize Vision 2030, the Government also prepared a Medium-Term Plan (MTP) for
2008 to 2012. The CPS aims to support government efforts to implement the MTP and achieve
Vision 2030, building on stakeholder feedback and lessons learned in implementing the Country
Assistance Strategy for FY04-08. To do so, the Bank will bring knowledge and best practices to
help find practical solutions to Kenyan problems, working with local partners. It will also seek
to ensure that all Bank activities help to improve governance by building responsive, capable and
accountable state agencies. Concretely, this implies that the Bank Group will seek to understand
sector-wide governance challenges; improve supply-side accountability in fiscal management,
public procurement, government auditing, and the civil service; expand demand-side
accountability, particularly for beneficiaries of public services; set and enforce high standards for
managing Bank resources; and build coalitions for addressing governance and anti-corruption
challenges at the country level.
iii.
World Bank Group Strategy With this CPS, the Bank Group intends to make a
catalytic contribution to Kenya’s continuing transformation to a middle-income country. Over
the CPS period, the World Bank Group will contribute to achieving more inclusive growth by
supporting activities aiming to (i) unleash Kenya’s growth potential, (ii) reduce inequality and
social exclusion, and (iii) address resource constraints and environmental challenges.
Unleashing Kenya’s growth potential will involve efforts to improve the business environment;

expand core infrastructure, especially in roads, water and electricity (with a view to deepening
regional integration); enhance agricultural productivity, with a focus on food security; and
strengthen public sector management and sub-national governance. Reducing inequality and
social exclusion will involve increasing the access of the poor to basic education, health services
and water and sanitation, and improving social safety nets, given Kenya’s history of unequally
shared development. In addition, the Bank Group will help the Government to improve the
management of land and water resources, especially in key water catchment areas, and to address
climate-change risks and opportunities, given Kenya’s high dependence on rainfed agriculture
and its vulnerability to climate change. In line with the Bank’s governance and anti-corruption
framework, the Bank will promote good governance as a cross cutting theme by helping to build
more capable and accountable government at the national, local and agency level and to
strengthen core governance systems in procurement and public financial management.
iv.
The World Bank Group Program. The bulk of IDA financing to Kenya over the CPS
period will be in the form of investment lending, but a development policy lending series focused
on public financial management, business regulation, financial sector reform and demand-side
accountability is also under consideration. Over the CPS period, the Bank will consolidate
smaller projects into larger programs which the Government could scale-up with its own
financing. Average annual IDA and IFC commitments are expected to amount to about US$400
million (assuming that IDA16 commitment authority is at least the same as IDA15) and US$100
million respectively. The Bank will continue to work closely with other development partners in
the context of the Kenya Joint Assistance Strategy, as well as with civil society, the media and
other stakeholders. Strategic communications will seek to provide information to all
stakeholders, provoke constructive debate, and strengthen the hand of reformers as well as
beneficiaries seeking to hold service providers to account.
v.
Implementing the Program. The World Bank Group will organize its program along
the lines of eight core result areas. For each of these, the CPS anticipates plans to design, budget
and monitor an integrated program of AAA, lending, trust funds and partnership activities,
including through SWAps. The Bank will adjust its program depending on opportunities and
progress in the core results areas, integrating IFC and MIGA resources in areas that will be
jointly pursued. The Bank Group will also strengthen partnership activities through the
Development Partner Forum, which the World Bank co-chairs. In delivering the program, the
Bank Group will pay particular attention to strengthening portfolio implementation, furthering
the knowledge agenda, and leveraging resources through strategic partnerships and trust funds.
vi.
Managing Risks. The CPS strategy has risks, including political tensions as the
referendum on the constitution in mid-2010 and the 2012 elections approach; reversal of
macroeconomic achievements, particularly near the next elections; vulnerability to external
shocks and to climate change; terrorism; and project management and fiduciary risks, including
corruption. The CPS proposes actions to mitigate all of these risks—recognizing that failure to
engage effectively constitutes the biggest risk of all.

ii

Staff would appreciate views from Executive Directors on the following matters:


Do the three objectives of the CPS, and proposed activities, adequately reflect Kenya’s
development challenges?



Are the programs of the IFC, IDA and IBRD well integrated and mutually supportive?



Does the results framework provide for sufficient accountability?



Is there room for development policy lending in Kenya?

I.

Country Context
A.

Political Developments

1.
Kenya enjoyed decades of relative peace following independence in 1963, but
political differences have often caused growth to slow and ethnic conflicts to flare.
Multiparty elections have taken place since 1992. While elections in 2002 were peaceful, free
and fair, the most recent polls in December 2007 involved intense political rivalry, disappointed
expectations on the part of some, and sharply disputed presidential results. Widespread ethnicbased violence ensued, leading to about 1,100 deaths and 350,000 internally displaced people
(IDPs). In February 2008, the opposing coalitions came together through a national dialogue and
reconciliation process led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. This process resulted
inter alia in a grand coalition government and the creation of an office of the Prime Minister.
President Kibaki (who leads the Party of National Unity, PNU) retained the presidency while his
key rival, Raila Odinga (who leads the Orange Democratic Movement, ODM), became the Prime
Minister. While ethnic tensions still run through social and political life in Kenya, often beneath
the surface, a fragile stability had been maintained since the coalition government was formed.
2.
The national dialogue and reconciliation process continues to frame political
discussion in Kenya today. Progress has been made in addressing its four agenda items but
much remains to be done:


Agenda Item 1 involved immediate action to stop violence and restore fundamental
rights. It urged the Government to disarm militias, the police to act impartially, and the
media to adhere to a code of conduct. After the coalition government was agreed, the
violence largely stopped, but since then new forms have arisen; criminal gangs are
extending their activities; some communities are forming vigilante groups, arousing fear
and division; and resource-based conflicts remain a deep concern.



Agenda Item 2 involved immediate measures to address the humanitarian crisis and
promote healing and reconciliation. It aimed to have IDPs return home; political leaders
to encourage reconciliation; and the Government to establish peace committees as well as
a Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC). While the Government has
helped to resettle IDPs, about 20,000 IDP households remain in transit camps, fearing to
return home. At the same time, reconciliation processes remain ad hoc and incomplete.
A TJRC was appointed in July 2009, but its work has progressed slowly.



Agenda Item 3 involved resolution of the political crisis. While the coalition government
has held together, a proliferation of ministries and districts has raised costs and
inefficiencies. Moreover, because the coalition was formed to resolve political deadlock
rather than to implement a common vision, it has been hard for it to develop enough trust
and cohesion to agree on fundamental reforms: ethnic alliances often drive debate and
political opposition is weak.



Agenda Item 4 involved the resolution of long-standing issues, including land reform;
constitutional reform; poverty, inequality, and youth unemployment; transparency and
accountability; and national unity and cohesion. The challenges are enormous, given the
complexity of the issues, and progress has been mixed. On the recommendation of the
Kriegler Commission (September 2008), which found that the election was mishandled
by the political parties as well as the electoral commission, an interim electoral
commission was established in May 2009. Police and judiciary reforms have been
initiated, but they are modest in scope, and implementation lags. A National Land Policy
was approved by Parliament in December 2009. A new constitution is being drafted, and
in early 2010 the coalition partners agreed common positions with respect to the powers
of the executive and the level of decentralization; a referendum is expected in mid-2010.
Finally, there has been no progress in prosecuting the perpetrators of post-election
violence: although the Waki Commission (October 2008) found that specific individuals,
named in a sealed letter, organized the violence, Parliament refused to establish a local
tribunal to prosecute the suspects, and the matter is now before the International Criminal
Court (which received the sealed letter in mid-2009).

3.
Kenya is also influenced by events in neighboring countries, of which several are
experiencing instability. Somalia has not had an effective government for 19 years; low-grade
war continues to displace Somalis in south-central Somalia, and by January 2010 had driven
about 350,000 across the border into Kenya, which now hosts one of the largest refugee camps in
the world near Dadaab. In addition, some 50,000 refugees have crossed into Kenya from
southern Ethiopia and Sudan—where instability may grow with the approach of the 2010
Ethiopian elections as well as the 2011 referendum on southern Sudan’s independence.
Destabilizing spill-over effects from the region, including particularly from terrorist
organizations believed to be based in Somalia, remain a concern.
B.

Social and Poverty Trends

4.
Rapid population growth, urbanization and demographic transition will shape
Kenya’s development prospects for the next decades. This transformation will also affect
Kenya’s social stability, which remains fragile after the 2007-08 post-election violence. The
2009 census shows that Kenya’s population is growing by one million people every year, and
may reach 85 million by 2050. Starting in 2000, working-age Kenyans exceeded dependents for
the first time, and from 2020 to 2050 Kenya will benefit from a “demographic bonus”, as the
working-age population increases much more sharply than dependents. This provides an
opportunity to Kenya, provided that job creation keeps pace.
5.
Kenya is on track to achieve some MDGs, but not all. It is not likely to eradicate
extreme poverty and hunger (MDG 1), as per capita GDP growth rates have been too low and
erratic to reduce sharply the proportion of people living in poverty. Free primary education,
introduced in 2003, dramatically improved access and completion rates,1 so Kenya may reach
MDG 2, but there are still about one million primary school age children out of school and many
1

The net primary enrollment rate increased from 84 percent for boys and 83 percent for girls in 2006 to 95 percent
for boys and 91 percent for girls; the primary completion rate from 67 percent to 80 percent; and the transition rate
to secondary school from 60 percent in 2008 to 64 percent in 2009.

2

school leavers still have very low levels of learning achievements. With improved gender parity
in education, Kenya may also achieve one target of MDG 3. Although preliminary results from
the 2008-09 Demographic and Health Survey indicate that the child mortality rate fell from 115
in 2003 to 74 in 2007, and the infant mortality rate from 77 to 52, Kenya is still unlikely to
achieve MDG 4. The prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting has not changed much
during the last 15 years, and malnutrition remains a key contributor to half of child and infant
deaths in Kenya. Maternal mortality did not improve significantly in the 2000s, and so MDG 5
remains out of reach. By contrast, Kenya is likely to achieve MDG 6, as it has been able to
sharply reduce its adult HIV prevalence rate, due in part to successful awareness-raising efforts
that have led to less risky behavior.
6.
The Bank’s 2009 Poverty Assessment for Kenya showed that the overall headcount
poverty rate, using the country’s official national poverty line, fell from 51 percent in 1997
to 47 percent in 2005-06. The poverty rate was much higher in rural areas (50 percent) than in
urban areas (34 percent). Available poverty estimates predate the post-election instability and
recent food and international economic crises and consequently do not reflect their impact. Over
the decade to 2007, overall rural poverty fell, but more than half of households experienced
poverty at some point. Shocks appear to be an important driver of households falling into
poverty, or deeper into existing poverty. The most common shocks over the period 2000-05
were, in order of importance, food price inflation, droughts and floods, illness, and death in the
family, followed by the death of livestock. The Poverty Assessment also shows that the main
correlates of poverty are low income diversification, low access to credit, inequality in land
ownership, and poor infrastructure. Key drivers out of poverty are diversification of household
activities and access to roads that connect lagging rural areas to urban markets and urban slum
dwellers to opportunities elsewhere within their cities. Geographically, the main urban areas
have above average per capita income and faster declines in the poverty headcount. Per capita
income in the poorest regions is just 50-60 percent of the national average.
7.
Inequality is high in Kenya. Kenya’s Gini coefficient of 48 (2005-06) is similar to
Rwanda and Uganda, above Tanzania and Ethiopia (see Table 1), and higher than the 42.5 Kenya
registered in 1997. Rates of inequality are even higher for reported earnings and land ownership.

8.
Access to services varies widely across Kenya and is exceptionally poor in urban
slums. Nairobi and Central province generally fare better in access to social services, and so
human development outcomes. For example, the risk of infant death in Nyanza is six times
greater than in Central province; educational attainment in Coast, Northeastern and Western
provinces lags behind the center, very significantly at the secondary level; and while school
3

enrolment nationally is near gender parity, Northeastern province in 2008 enrolled 750,000 boys
but only 400,000 girls. Infrastructure services are also unevenly distributed. Recent gains in
electricity, sanitation and telephone ownership were concentrated in Nairobi and Central
provinces, though in Nairobi’s slums, for example, only 19 percent of households have access to
a private piped water connection, 22 percent to electricity, and 25 percent to a working drain
outside their house. Central, Eastern and Nyanza provinces saw gains in access to safe water,
but Western and Rift Valley experienced losses. While access to electricity nationally increased
by 50 percent over the last decade, Western and Nyanza provinces experienced drops in
coverage rates. Improvements in roads have been more widespread.
9.
Poverty, rising inequality and the social and economic exclusion of rural
populations also contribute to higher levels of crime and violence in Kenya. In the 1980s
and 1990s, rural livelihoods were sharply eroded, due to lack of access to land, declining human
capital (due largely to HIV/AIDS), and the corruption or collapse of formal institutions
(especially for agricultural marketing and services). Rural households responded by migrating
into urban slums or diversifying into off-farm and non-farm activities, though limited assets
restricted options and forced some into marginal activities such as squatting, charcoal
production, and illicit brewing. These livelihood shifts dramatically impacted the relations
between household members. New demands and opportunities arose in areas dominated by
women, such as food crop production, petty trade, informal services, beer brewing, casual labor,
domestic service, home care for the sick, and gathering forest products and firewood. By
contrast, livelihoods dominated by men, such as pastoralism and cash crop production, were
eroded, and many men began to feel disempowered and responded to these adverse
developments by diversifying their activities off the farm and increasing reliance on community
organizations. At the same time, youth with more education than their parents found themselves
without jobs or assets, and were forced to remain in their parent’s households well into
adulthood, resulting in intergenerational conflict over land, income, and family property. These
shifts also contributed to higher levels of crime and violence. Kenya’s homicide rate, at three to
six per 100,000 people, is basically unchanged since 1987, and lower than in many sub-Saharan
African countries, but offenses against people (assault and causing disturbance) and property
(theft, burglary, and robbery) are pervasive, constituting 60 percent of all crimes reported to the
police. While crime and violence remain concentrated in Nairobi and other large urban centers,
in recent years they have also permeated rural areas, reducing mobility, school attendance,
economic activity, quality of life, and trust within communities and in public institutions.
Moreover, it is the poor who are most affected by crime and violence, having fewer means to
cope.
10.
Gender inequality also remains a key issue in Kenya. Women account for only 30
percent of wage employment and 24 percent of civil service employment, mostly in lower
cadres. A woman is less likely to be employed, especially if young, and her income is typically
significantly lower than a man’s in the same job. Only 10 percent of parliamentarians and 17
percent of ministers are women, and female representation in productive organizations and
parastatals is small. While women contribute most agricultural labor, their access to land is
limited, and consequently they have less access to farm inputs, credit, and extension advice, and
limited involvement in cash-crop production. Women are also mainly responsible for household
duties, which can be onerous: indeed HIV/AIDS, climate change, and other livelihood stresses
are increasingly requiring women to spend more time to collect water and fuel wood and care for
4

the sick. Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that poverty among female-headed
households is about five percentage points higher than among male-headed households, and is
especially widespread in urban households headed by widows. Girls and women also suffer
from practices such as female genital mutilation, early marriage, and gender-based violence.
While temporary measures to improve girls’ access have improved gender parity in education
since 2003, gender disparity persists in rural and poor areas and in higher education, and female
literacy remains markedly lower than male literacy, especially in rural areas and urban slums.
11.
High levels of inequality explain why Kenya’s growth translates into limited poverty
reduction. While average consumption per capita increased between 1997 and 2006, it fell 0.7
percent for the poorest 20 percent of the population. If inequality had not worsened, the poverty
headcount would have fallen by almost 20 percent nationally (and 15 percent in rural areas),
instead of 5.5 percent nationally (and 3 percent in rural areas), as actually occurred.
Governance
12.
Kenya has a mixed record on governance. In comparison to its peers, it scores well on
voice, regulatory quality, revenue mobilization, public administration, and macroeconomic and
budgetary management. By contrast, Kenya scores well below the norm for lower-income
countries and for sub-Saharan Africa on rule of law and control of corruption. 2

On the positive side, public financial management (PFM) has been improved. The
government’s audit capacity has been strengthened, the macroeconomic framework linked with
fiscal planning, and an integrated payroll and personnel database introduced. That said, the
Government needs to do more work to roll out the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) and to improve cash management, achieve program-based budgeting, and
consolidate procurement reforms. There has also been some progress in public sector reform, as
the Results for Kenyans Reform Program (2004) introduced results-based management (RBM)
into the public service and contributed to significantly more openness and transparency in the

public sector as well as improved performance through innovations such as manager
performance contracts and rapid results initiatives. Nonetheless, much more needs to be done to
inculcate public service values across all parts of government.
14.
This mixed story – of solid progress in economic policy-making and halting progress
on governance issues – is captured in Kenya’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) ratings. Figure 2 compares Kenya’s CPIA ratings with IDA countries in sub-Saharan
Africa. Particularly notable is Kenya’s success with fiscal stabilization, budget management,
financial sector reforms and openness to the private sector. In terms of policies and
management, Kenya is one of the strongest macroeconomic performers in the region. Yet there
are also some important areas where Kenya lags, particularly in property rights, and to a lesser
degree gender equality and public resources supporting pro-poor programs. These are areas
where government leadership supported by external partners can begin to make a difference.
Finally, governance and transparency remain issues for Kenya, as they are for most of the
countries in the region. Overall, Kenya scores better than its peers because it has in place a
strengthening legal and institutional framework designed to enhance government accountability.
While many of these programs have yet to gain traction, an independent media and strong civil
society are seen as important partners in developing a culture of accountability.

Poor governance, and particularly corruption, remains a source of risk for any
investment in Kenya. Two episodes of grand corruption in the last two decades illustrate the
difficulties that elite capture presents in Kenya (see Box 1). On the positive side, the ongoing
national dialogue and reconciliation process has created opportunity and some momentum for
6

needed governance reforms, and many entities have been established to address key issues and
have begun their technical work.3 In addition, the Government has made progress in past years
in several areas. Key legislation has been passed,4 including an anti-money laundering law but
not including a much needed freedom of information bill. In addition, administrative reforms
have been implemented to outlaw political fundraising events, reform tax administration, and
simplify business licensing.
Box 1: Grand Corruption cases in Kenya: what has been done?
When observers discuss corruption in Kenya, the Goldenberg and Anglo Leasing scandals remain
prominent. What has happened since these scandals became known?
The Goldenberg scandal was exposed in 1993 by a whistleblower in the central bank.
Goldenberg International allegedly smuggled gold into Kenya from Zaire to take advantage of an exportpromotion scheme that allowed exporters who deposited US dollars with the central bank to receive the
equivalent in Kenya shillings, plus 20 percent. It is widely believed that a significant portion of the
exported gold was fictitious; that the local currency mark-up was 35 percent; and that the scheme netted
as much as US$600 million. This scheme was not probed until 2005-06, when a report prepared by
Justice Bosire recommended that the then Vice President and Minister for Finance be charged and the
then President investigated. The former Vice President, who was in 2006 the Minister for Education,
resigned, but the High Court ruled in July 2006 that he should not be charged and he was reinstated in
November 2006. The former President was not investigated.
The Anglo Leasing scandal has its origin in a Government effort in 2002 to obtain passport
printing equipment and forensic laboratories from Europe. A €6 million contract was originally to be
awarded to a French firm, but later a €31.9 million supplier-credit contract was awarded on a singlesource basis to a UK firm, Anglo Leasing, to do the same work. A 2004-05 investigation initiated by a
Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President found that Anglo Leasing was one of many ghost
companies (linked through directors’ names, addresses, and shareholders) that Government officials were
using to divert public money, through overpricing or non-delivery of goods and services; the associated
lease and supplier-credit contracts totaled about US$650 million. When the investigation’s findings were
made public, the implicated Ministers for Finance and for Justice resigned, but both were subsequently
reappointed; later, another implicated Minister was demoted and he and the previous Minister for Finance
lost their bids for re-election. In addition, three Permanent Secretaries who were implicated have been
charged and removed from office. The Anglo Leasing scandal was also the subject of special audits by
the Auditor General and the Parliamentary Accounts Committee.

These include the Committee of Experts on the Constitution, the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission, the
Independent Interim Electoral Commission, the Independent Interim Boundaries Review Commission, and the
National Cohesion and Integration Commission.

These include the 2003 Public Officer Ethics Act, which introduced a code of conduct and asset declaration for
public officers; the 2003 Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, which established the Kenya Anti-Corruption
Commission; the 2004 Government Financial Management Act; the 2004 Public Audit Act; the 2005 Privatization
Act, which increased accountability and transparency in the privatization process; the 2006 Statistics Act, which
established an independent statistics bureau; the 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act, which established the
Public Procurement Oversight Authority; and the 2009 Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act.

The Economic Context
C.

Recent Economic Developments

16.
Like much of Africa, Kenya began the 21st century with a decade of relatively
strong growth. From 2000-09, it averaged 3.7 percent. For the first time since the 1970s, most
Kenyans saw their incomes rising, albeit by only 1.0 percent per annum (although the poorest
groups saw relatively little change). Over 2002 to 2007, growth picked up in all key sectors of
the economy, including agriculture, industry and services, with tourism achieving a remarkable
22 percent growth per annum (measured in US$ receipts). This remarkable growth performance
has been attributed to the successful presidential transition of December 2002, which produced a
large economic dividend. Starting in 2003-04, there was a perceptible change for the better in
Kenya’s economic outcomes. Interest rates declined, external assistance started flowing in,
investor confidence jumped, and growth prospects improved. This positive outcome coupled
with a favorable external environment, macroeconomic stability and strong fiscal adjustment,
and a strong revenue effort combined with a remarkable reduction in debt as a share of GDP.
During this period of high growth, Kenya further strengthened its fiscal position and brought its
public debt down from 60 percent of GDP in 2000 to 40 percent in 2008. As a result of this
strong growth performance, incomes per capita increased and poverty declined from 53 percent
in 1997 to 47 percent in 2005-06. Nonetheless, unemployment remains a major concern,
especially among the urban youth (see Figure 3).

Unlike most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya’s growth does not depend
principally on agriculture. About 55 percent of GDP comes from services (transport, finance,
tourism, ICT, and trade), where the private sector has been especially entrepreneurial in
exploiting the country’s geographical advantages (particularly access to the sea through the port
of Mombasa and proximity to inland markets for its manufactures). Kenya also gained from the
introduction of the East African Community (EAC) customs union, with exports to the EAC
doubling over 2002 to 2007 (from about US$650 million to US$1.3 billion) and imports
quadrupling over 2004 and 2007. Nevertheless, limitations on access to credit, unreliable and
expensive electricity supply, logistical constraints (for example, inefficiency in and around the
port of Mombasa, dilapidated road infrastructure, and poor performance of the rail concession),
and high costs of doing business (due to taxes, corruption, insecurity, and local licensing costs)
also prevented Kenya from maximizing its potential for private sector-led growth.
18.
In 2008 and 2009, growth decelerated sharply, due to four major shocks. These
included the violence following the Presidential elections of December 2007, high international
food and fuel prices in 2008, the global financial crisis in 2008-09, and four consecutive failures
in seasonal rains, resulting in widespread drought. Kenya’s economy was projected to grow at
8.3 percent and to attain a 10 percent growth by 2012 in line with Vision 2030. Instead, the post
election violence brought growth to a low of 1.7 percent in 2008 and, combined with external
shocks, 2.5 percent in 2009.
19.
Kenya has been strongly affected by the domestic shocks over the last few years, but
it managed the international shocks very well. Kenya entered the global crisis from a
relatively strong macroeconomic position, benefitting from reforms in the banking sector and
budget management in the preceding years. To cushion the economy from a further downturn,
the government adopted an expansionary fiscal policy. The FY09-10 budget includes a fiscal
stimulus package and the budget deficit is projected at 6.6 percent of GDP (US$2.1 billion).
Total public debt will increase from 42 percent of GDP to 44 percent during the fiscal year, still
within sustainable limits. That said, post-election violence in 2008 markedly hurt both the
tourism industry (down 35 percent) and agriculture (down 5 percent). While tourism recovered in
2009, agriculture continued to contract in 2009 (by about 2.5 percent). Due to Kenya’s heavy
reliance on hydropower, the drought also resulted in shortages in the electricity and water sectors
(down 10 percent), which in turn hit manufacturing.
20.
During the global financial crisis Kenya’s current account deficit increased from 4.5
percent (2008) to 7.5 percent of GDP (2009). The overall balance of payments turned negative
as the trade balance widened further and service exports leveled off. To help Kenya cope with
the situation, the IMF provided US$200 million from the rapid access component of its
Exogenous Shock Facility in June 2009, and Kenya later received US$350 million from the
special and general allocation of SDRs that was made available to all IMF member nations.
21.
Kenya has managed its debt burden well. Keeping debt levels below HIPC Initiative
thresholds, Kenya never qualified to receive HIPC debt relief. Moreover, since 2003, strong
economic growth, prudent fiscal policies, and lower interest rates brought debt levels down from
60 percent of GDP in 2000 to 42 percent in 2009. As of end-2008, Kenya’s net domestic debt
stood at Ksh 340.4 billion, or 16.1 percent of GDP, and its nominal public external debt was
estimated at US$6.2 billion (20.4 percent of GDP). A debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
9

undertaken jointly by the Bank and the IMF in May 2009 found that Kenya would remain under
its indicative debt stock and debt service thresholds, under all alternative scenarios and stress
tests considered. While comforting, this does not provide grounds for complacency, as the DSA
also found debt sustainability to be particularly vulnerable to low GDP growth.
22.
There have also been notable improvements in strengthening the institutional
framework for debt management and the development of debt markets. A Debt
Management Department (DMD) was established at the Ministry of Finance in 2007 and a wideranging debt database has been installed and made operational. In June 2009, Kenya also
formulated a Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), with a target debt-to-GDP ratio of 40
percent. The MTDS is vulnerable to two risks: (i) that GDP growth is lower than projected; and
(ii) that potential unreported contingent liabilities are realized.
Kenya’s medium-term prospects
23.
Kenya is expected to grow by about 3.5 to 4.0 percent in 2010, continuing its
recovery since 2008 and resulting in a modest increase in income per capita. This would be
close to the projected average of 4.1 percent for sub-Saharan Africa, but significantly below
projections for its EAC neighbors and below the 5 percent growth achieved before the crisis.
The recovery will be driven by services (especially transport, communication, tourism and trade)
and to a lesser degree industry, with the overall growth rate highly dependent on favorable
rainfall (supporting agriculture) and the speed of the global economic recovery (supporting
Kenyan export and tourism markets in Europe). Although consumer prices spiked sharply
upward in 2008 and 2009, the Government has continued to manage inflation effectively.5
Assuming normal rainfall, drought impacts will end in early 2010, permitting a recovery for
agriculture and greater reliability in electricity and water supply. This in turn should enable
manufacturing to grow in line with domestic demand and regional growth (as the EAC and
COMESA are Kenya’s main markets). Industry, which has been led by construction in recent
years, should continue to receive some support from the stimulus package. Assuming that oil,
fertilizer and commodity prices remain stable at 2009 levels (and therefore that no significant
gains in terms of trade should be expected), but that exports and private remittances will expand,
the current account should also improve, though it will remain in deficit below 6.0 percent of
GDP in 2010.
24.
In addition, Kenya’s private sector should benefit from Kenya’s participation in
regional trading blocs. An EAC Common Market protocol signed in November 2009 will
allow for the free movement of goods, people and services and should open up significant trade
and investment opportunities in the region; monetary union, scheduled for 2012, would also
provide a boost. Kenya is also a member of the Common Market for East and Southern Africa
(COMESA) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The EAC-SADCCOMESA tripartite is working intensively to increase collaboration and launch a new East and

5

In October 2009, the Government also changed the methodology, which has been endorsed by the IMF, for
calculating inflation, to bring it into line with international best practice. This more accurate assessment of price
changes brought inflation from 18.7 percent in September to 6.6 percent in October, which is near the Central
Bank’s target of 5 percent. The new methodology also removes the upward bias of the previous one, creating more
certainty for business and labor and adding credibility to the Central Bank’s monetary policy.

Southern African Free Trade Area. IGAD, which covers the Horn countries, has to date focused
mainly on climate change and conflict resolution and is looking to increase its focus on
economic development.
25.
In the medium term, Kenya’s real growth is projected at 5.0 percent in 2011 and 6.3
percent in 2012, assuming full recovery (see Figure 4 and Table 3). For the period 2011-12,
agriculture is projected to expand at 3.0 percent annually and industry at 5.0 percent, mainly
driven by construction (given that the high cost of doing business for manufacturing will
continue to constrain that sector). Continuing with the recovery from 2010, robust growth is
projected for services, notably tourism, transport and telecommunications, trending with the
global recovery. Tourism performance will be boosted by aggressive source market
diversification under implementation by the key sector players; overall the sector is expected to
grow 6.0 percent in 2011 and 8.0 percent in 2012.

While Kenya has demonstrated that it can grow, it also remains vulnerable to both
external and domestic shocks, which constitute significant risks to its projected growth
path. The performance of the agriculture sector remains dependent on weather patterns and the
political cycle influences private sector expectations and investment decisions. Factoring in low
rainfalls and an uncertain political process leading to the elections in 2012, GDP growth is likely
to be much lower. In this conservative estimate, growth is projected at 4.5 percent in 2011 and
4.0 percent in 2012 (an election year), with a full recovery after 2013 (see Table 3).
27.
The government’s debt strategy has a target of 40 percent debt to GDP, and it
reached this target in 2008. Responding to the global financial crisis and other shocks, the
Government has enacted a fiscal stimulus which will increase debt levels temporarily. The
budget deficit increased to 6.3 percent in 2009 and is expected to decline again to 4.8 percent by
2011. Under the base case growth assumptions, these budget deficits would translate into a
renewed decline of debt levels to 41 percent by 2013 (see Table 3).

Country Development Program and Issues
A.

Country Priorities and Agenda

Vision 2030 and the Medium-Term Plan
28.
In mid-2008, the Government prepared a new long-term development strategy,
Vision 2030, which aims to transform Kenya into a globally-competitive, prosperous,
middle-income country within 22 years. The strategy has three pillars: an economic pillar that
aims to achieve economic growth of 10 percent per annum; a social pillar that aims to build a just
and cohesive society enjoying equitable social development in a clean and secure environment;
and a political pillar that aims to build an issue-based, people-centered, result-oriented and
accountable democratic political system.
29.
To operationalize Vision 2030, the Government prepared a more detailed MediumTerm Plan (MTP) for the first five-year phase, covering 2008 to 2012.6 The MTP aimed at a
quick recovery from the economic setback of 2008, by implementing macroeconomic and
structural policies that would accelerate real GDP growth from 7 percent in 2007 to 10 percent
by 2012. Fiscal policy would aim to reduce the fiscal imbalance and anchor debt at 20.4 percent
of GDP throughout the period; monetary policy to ensure low inflation; public financial
management reform to strengthen macroeconomic stability and improve public sector
performance and service delivery; and financial sector reform to increase national savings to
sustain growth. External sector policy would focus on increasing capital inflows to finance
growth and foreign reserve accumulation to buffer potential vulnerabilities. These policies
would facilitate the achievement of an increase in the level of investment by about 10 percentage
points over the medium term, of which about 40 percent would come from the public sector.
The MTP acknowledged that higher growth would require increased total factor productivity
which, in turn, could only be achieved through structural reform. Accordingly, it examined the
constraints to growth sector by sector; identified policy, legal and institutional reforms for
completion in the medium term; and proposed “flagship projects” to be implemented in key
6

Republic of Kenya 2008.

12

sectors. It also identified several cross-cutting governance issues that adversely affect growth in
many sectors, noting inter alia the need to fight corruption and simplify business procedures.
30.
A Bank-Fund joint staff assessment note (JSAN)—discussed by the Board on March
23, 2010—found that the MTP presents a reasonable program on a sector-by-sector basis,
but also that it is weak in setting priorities and too optimistic in light of past experience and
the shocks that occurred after it was developed. While the sector-specific plans are
compatible with the government’s other planning documents, many goals and programs lack
prioritization. In addition, most headline targets are unlikely to be met and so cannot serve as
measures to hold the Government accountable for success or failure; they are best seen as
expectations.
31.
A critical thrust of Vision 2030 and the MTP is to accelerate growth through
increased investment in infrastructure. The vision is to build modern, high-quality and
efficient infrastructure facilities to expand access to markets. Areas of emphasis include
rehabilitating the road network; upgrading the railways; transforming ports and airports to create
hubs for a modern economy; improving urban public transport; and expanding access to
electricity and safe water. To this end, total investments are expected to increase from about 23
percent of GDP in 2007-08 to more than 32 percent by 2012. For this to occur, private sector
funds will need to be mobilized, and the strategy aims to leverage Kenya’s robust private sector
to develop flagship projects in agriculture, finance, manufacturing, and business process
outsourcing. (The JSAN notes that interventionist capital-intensive approaches of this kind can
misfire, and that Kenya’s private sector may respond more fully to a level playing field that
supports more broad-based and sustained growth with potentially a wider spread of benefits.)
32.
Another key MTP objective is more equitable development through accelerated
rural development. Agriculture remains a key sector, due to its large economic contribution,
potential to create jobs, and proven competitiveness on world markets. The MTP and the newly
formulated sector strategy appropriately focus on policies and programs for enhancing food
security, productivity and value addition; developing arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs); and
strengthening producer organizations and their linkages with markets. Investments in irrigation
and livestock marketing infrastructure will be needed to unleash ASAL potential, and reform and
privatization of agricultural parastatals (e.g., for sugar and livestock) should be fast-tracked.
Unfortunately, as the JSAN notes, the MTP does not adequately accommodate downside risks
from the external environment, including weather-related shocks. Bringing 2008-09 performance
and downside risks into the MTP targets would bring projected average agriculture growth to
around 6.5 percent, assuming targets for 2010-12 are achieved.
33.
As the JSAN notes, the MTP’s discussion of financing could be strengthened. It
projects only a modest rise in domestic financing, since the target on the debt-to-GDP ratio puts
an upper bound on debt accumulation, and assumes that the budget can be reallocated to
accommodate spending on the flagship projects. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are to be
explored, but these will require due consideration to costs, financing, and tax obligations (under
certain circumstances long-term financial leases could be equivalent to non-concessional
financing) as well as further strengthening of the institutional framework (initiated with the
establishment of a PPP unit in the Ministry of Finance). The MTP also assumes a small increase
13

in aid and a large increase in private sector and commercial financing, with the introduction of a
sovereign bond in international markets expected to increase private inflows into the economy.
34.
The MTP also sets out appropriate goals for the education and health sectors. With
increased primary school enrollment achieved by the elimination of school fees, the MTP rightly
stresses steps to improve efficiency at all levels of the education sector. In the health sector, the
MTP aims to provide affordable high-quality health care to all Kenyans, to reduce the incidence
of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and to lower infant, child and maternal mortality rates
by rehabilitating health facilities, strengthening procurement and distribution of essential
medicines and supplies, and developing equitable healthcare financing mechanisms.
Unfortunately, detailed plans are lacking, and more thinking is needed to link actions and
reforms to the MTP’s laudable aims.
35.
Finally, while the MTP includes institutional arrangements for monitoring and
evaluating implementation, this will require strengthening the Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics (KNBS), which heads the National Statistical System (NSS). Reforms within KNBS
have been encouraging but remain incomplete; in particular, the agency has not made sufficient
progress in aspects of national accounts and external sector data, which are within its primary
responsibility. That said, key sources of information such as the 2008-09 Demographic and
Health Survey, the 2009 national population census, and a new round of the Integrated
Household Budget survey in 2010-11, should help to expand near- and medium-term analysis.
B.

Key structural and sectoral issues

36.
The proposed CPS will support the government’s efforts to achieve growth with
equity and environmental sustainability, in line with Vision 2030 and the MTP. Privatesector led growth will reduce poverty through creating jobs and generating the tax revenues
needed to support service delivery. But in Kenya growth also needs to be spread equitably so
that the poor can participate; and it needs to be environmentally-sustainable, given the enormous
pressures that a rapidly growing population is already exerting on Kenya’s fragile ecosystems.
37.
For a strong economic recovery and sustained per capita growth over the medium
term, Kenya needs to sustain and complete key structural reforms in a number of areas:


Macroeconomic management (including financial sector stability): Going forward, the
Government needs to maintain its strong record and ensure that future borrowing does
not compromise macroeconomic stability or crowd out lending to the private sector.



Cost of doing business: Kenya needs to resume efforts to reduce these costs. In the
2008 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), Kenyan firms reported an adverse business
environment due to taxes, corruption, insecurity, low access to credit, poor infrastructure7
and burdensome licensing requirements. Trade competitiveness is hindered by costs,
procedures and product standards. Lack of sustained reform also caused Kenya’s rank in
the Doing Business survey to fall from 72 in 2008 to 95 in 2010 (of 183 countries), with

7

For example, total losses incurred by Kenyan business in 2007 due to power outages, theft and breakage during
transport, payment of bribes and protection payments at 20 percent are much higher than total losses experienced by
middle income countries in Africa and by China and India.

14

weaknesses especially notable for paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing
contracts, registering property and starting a business—particularly in Nairobi, which
generates 50 percent of Kenya’s GDP. (If Kenya were to adopt nationally the best
practices already found in its cities, it would rank better than Italy or China.) Improving
the policy and regulatory framework, including in the financial sector, will provide
opportunities to enhance productivity and ensure sustainable and broad-based longerterm growth.


Infrastructure: Underinvestment in infrastructure, including maintenance, increases the
cost of doing business, undermines competitiveness, and adversely affects trade. The
2008-09 multi-donor infrastructure diagnostic for Kenya found that GDP growth would
expand by 2 percentage points with infrastructure similar to Mauritius, and that
investment in road rehabilitation, electricity generation, and water operations and
maintenance would provide the highest medium-term returns. In addition, the Poverty
Assessment found that improved infrastructure is associated with movements out of
poverty, and that improved water supply and sanitation would dramatically improve
human health, the environment, and the economy. Enhancing Kenya’s ability to raise
infrastructure finance from private sources, including through PPPs and corporate bonds,
is crucial to addressing underinvestment in infrastructure. While the PPP Regulations of
2009 created a PPP unit and established a Steering Committee responsible for ensuring
the quality of proposed PPPs and determining their liabilities to the Government, the
Committee needs to be made operational and a pipeline of pilot PPPs remains to be
identified.



Agriculture: There is an urgent need to achieve stalled policy reforms, clarify the
mandates of the sector ministries, and reform the commodity-based parastatals. The
Government’s high maize price policy needs review: it aims to support domestic
production, but in doing so enriches the 2 percent of households that realize half of maize
sales while impoverishing the 61 percent of households that are net maize buyers. More
can also be done to expand engagement with the private sector, promote off-farm and
non-farm (agribusiness) sources of growth, and improve fiduciary management in the
sector, including procurement.

38.
To sustain high growth, Kenya will also need to maximize the benefits from regional
integration. This involves ensuring that regional commitments are fully implemented, so that
non-tariff barriers cease to impede the free trade of goods, EAC citizens know their rights and
opportunities, and public officials on the front line (police and border post officials) adapt to the
new laws and regulations. Accelerating efforts to enhance financial sector integration, including
for payments systems and clearance and settlement systems, will also be important. The
renewed commitment to regional integration will boost trade, investment and economic activity.
39.
For poverty reduction to occur in Kenya, growth is not enough; it must also be
growth that reaches the poor. Only about 2 million people participate in the formal economy
(800,000 in the public sector and 1.2 million in the private sector) and enjoy the legal protections
and safety nets that such status confers. This group also tends to be vocal, politically connected,
and able to protect and expand its interests. By contrast, the remaining 20 million workers in
Kenya are in the informal economy; they are much less able to defend their interests, and with
15

limited savings and access to social security they are much more vulnerable to shocks. To help
ensure that growth is equitably distributed, attention needs to be paid to the following issues:


Access to basic services: Even before independence, Kenya struggled to control elite
capture, social exclusion, and skewed resource distribution. Equalizing investments in
health and education can help to correct this legacy. Free primary and secondary day
education constitute a good start in education, but further effort is needed to ensure
higher learning achievements. There are also challenges to increasing access to tertiary
education for youth. In health, much more can be done to strengthen health systems,
particularly in the three lowest tiers of Kenya’s six-tier system, and to ensure that
financial transfers are appropriately allocated among the tiers and across Kenya’s diverse
communities. In infrastructure, a special effort is required to connect the rural and urban
poor to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.



Social protection: A comprehensive social protection system is needed as part of a
balanced growth strategy to help address both chronic and transitory deprivation. At the
same time, effective targeting and strong monitoring and evaluation must be part of that
system, to help ensure that scarce resources reach the most needy and that programs are
as effective as possible. Work also needs to be done to develop a comprehensive safety
net strategy to address program fragmentation and strengthen systems.

40.
For growth in Kenya to be sustainable, it must also address resource scarcity and
environmental challenges. Natural resources are critical to the livelihoods of the 65 percent of
Kenyans who live in rural areas and also to the urban poor, who use wood and charcoal for their
fuel. But Kenya’s natural resource base is under stress. Population pressure, deforestation,
coastal modification, ongoing ecosystem degradation, unsustainable resource use and corruption
threaten vulnerable habitats and biodiversity and continue to contribute to landlessness, poverty,
social conflict and food insecurity. In the absence of an effective mitigation and adaptation
strategy, the impacts of climate change are likely to exacerbate the stress already experienced.
To this end, Kenyans need to focus on issues like:


Environment policy and management: Sustainable growth calls for policies that
address the economic, environmental and social principles of development. These
policies need to be agreed and implemented on a cross-sectoral basis, with a spatial focus
where possible.



Energy security: Improving energy security while also securing higher levels of
development will require maintaining energy prices at cost-reflective levels, taking into
account environmental aspects; adopting higher standards of energy efficiency; and
promoting greater regional electricity trade and expansion of renewable energy
generation.



Water security: Increasing water scarcity results in reduced water supplies and
hydroelectricity, growing competition, and potential conflicts over available water. This
threatens the country’s developmental goals, which are based on rapid economic growth
and urbanization, which in turn demand increased water. Moreover, losses from flood
and droughts are estimated at over 2 percent of GDP per year, constituting a serious
impact on Kenya’s competitiveness.
Hence, comprehensive development and
16

management of water resources is a priority. This will require adequate management of
the catchment areas, improved water harvesting and storage, and more expanded and
efficient water services, taking into consideration land uses and resource-dependent
communities.
41.
Finally, growth with equity and environmental sustainability will require good
governance. The Government has undertaken some governance reforms, but many challenges
remain. In addition to improving PFM and the public service, Kenyans expect the Government
to prepare a new constitution and to reform, in fundamental ways, the electoral system, the
security sector (including the police) and the judiciary, with a view to restoring efficiency and
popular trust and confidence in these degraded institutions. Kenyans also expect the
Government to contain insecurity and significantly reduce youth unemployment, which is
believed to contribute to criminal gang activity.
III.

Country Partnership Strategy for Kenya
A.

Lessons Learned from FY04-08 CAS and Stakeholder Feedback

42.
The Board discussed the last CAS (FY04-07) in June 2004 and a Progress Report
(FY07-08) in February 2007. The CAS Completion Report (Annex 16) provides an assessment
of that strategy’s success. The CAS objective was to promote “growth with equity and poverty
reduction”. The CAS Progress Report retained the objective and added a pillar to address
governance. From the Bank’s experience in implementing these strategies, we have learned the
following lessons:


The overall strategic direction of the CAS was appropriate. Macroeconomic stability,
infrastructure investments, improved health and education, and good governance are key
to growth and poverty reduction. In addition, the CPS will pay more attention to
structural inequalities and vulnerabilities.



Corruption remains a major portfolio risk. Between 2005 and 2009, INT and the
Government’s Internal Audit Department found evidence of corruption in Bank-financed
infrastructure contracts and local-level contracts (where elite capture is problematic). To
address this issue effectively, the Bank needs to work with the Government to limit
opportunities for corruption, remain vigilant for corrupt practices, and deal with them
effectively if found.



The Bank needs to improve its understanding of the political economy, particularly
in sectors where it finances operations and offers policy advice. While the Bank has a
good understanding of the formal laws, regulations and institutions related to its
activities, it often has less knowledge about informal relationships and institutions that
can influence reforms, thereby limiting its effectiveness as a change agent. Where the
Bank’s work suggests that reform will be strongly resisted, it needs to be patient and
work to change the circumstances, with a view to creating an opportunity for effective
intervention.



Continued strategic engagement is critical for success. The Bank has had a history of
on/off engagement, with withdrawal often prompted by corruption or political scandal.
17

This unpredictability has strained an otherwise productive 50-year relationship, pushed
project implementation off-track (often raising costs), and required repeated efforts on
both sides to rebuild trust. Criteria need to be developed to manage expectations on both
sides.


The Bank can help to improve economic governance, at national and sector levels.
Bank advice and policy dialogue has helped to improve PFM, including particularly in
energy, roads and urban water supply, helping service delivery entities to improve
profitability and create the fiscal space for investments in infrastructure rehabilitation and
expansion.



The Bank should focus on fewer sectors or sub-sectors and agree a sharper division
of labor with other development partners. Given current commitments and the Bank’s
own resource constraints, the Bank needs to consolidate activities and decide jointly with
Government and other development partners how to be more strategic and selective,
including particularly when, where and how to disengage.



Better monitoring and evaluation is needed to ensure that projects remain on track.
Closer implementation support, annual audits and annual flow-of-funds reviews are
needed.



More attention to knowledge transfer is required. AAA needs to be better aligned
with government analytical priorities, and it should precede the development of sector
operations to ensure that interventions target sectors where the Bank has a comparative
advantage.



The Bank’s results framework needs to be more clearly focused. The FY04-08
results framework, with more than 60 outcomes, was not useful in monitoring CAS
impact. A more streamlined framework, with measurable time-bound indicators and
outcomes that are under the Bank’s direct control, would be better.

The FY10 Client Survey and multi-stakeholder consultations
43.
The proposed CPS is based on broad-based consultations with central and local
government officials, parliamentarians, development partners, and representatives of civil
society and the private sector. As co-chair of the Development Partner Coordination Group,
the Bank continuously consults with the Government and other stakeholders on the details of its
programming. Together with other development partners, the Bank will contribute to efforts to
update the Kenya Joint Assistance Strategy (KJAS). In addition, the Bank undertook specialized
consultations for this CPS and a Client Survey to understand perceptions of the Bank in Kenya.
(For further details on CPS consultations, see Annex 15).
B.

Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy

44.
This new CPS will result in a number of adjustments to the World Bank program.
Specifically these include:


Increasing knowledge generation, in partnership with Kenyan research institutions and
think tanks, with the Bank bringing global best practice to bear on local issues. In
seeking to generate knowledge and help solve Kenya’s development problems, the Bank
18

Group will aim to provide timely and interactive advice on issues arising within the
policy dialogue, both at the sector and national levels.


Putting an even stronger emphasis on governance, through structured dialogue, political
economy analysis, technical assistance to improve Government-wide systems and
practices, and focused attention on governance issues at the sector levels. This will build
on significant institutional improvements already achieved, for example, in the roads,
water and energy sectors.



Ensuring that measures to promote growth take due account of equity, e.g., by focusing
on job creation for the poor, underserved areas, and equitable funding across regions.



Addressing resource scarcities and environmental challenges, including adaptation to
climate change, in all projects and activities.



Initiating an urban development program to upgrade slums, improve urban service
delivery, and help generate agglomeration economies.



Fine-tuning our business model so that our program is delivered by a fully-decentralized
client-focused team that engages with the client on a regular basis to ensure effective
implementation and greater development impact of the IDA portfolio.

45.
Kenya’s complex political agenda and global economic uncertainty imply that the
Bank Group needs to be flexible and ready to adapt to changing circumstances. In this
context, the Group’s investment and AAA program will be reviewed annually, on a rolling basis,
in structured discussions with the Government, with a view to defining medium-term objectives,
outputs, and outcomes in light of changing circumstances. Accordingly, while the CPS sets out a
detailed investment program for the remainder of IDA15, the program for IDA16 is indicative,
with details to be determined in consultation with the Government and recorded in a CPS
Progress Report planned for FY12.
46.
The CPS is a Bank Group strategy, integrating the activities of IBRD, IDA, IFC and
MIGA. The CPS assumes that Kenya will absorb its full IDA15 allocation and about one-third
of its IDA16 allocation in each of FY12 and FY13. Kenya’s allocation in FY10 is SDR 312
million (US$475 million equivalent), including additional resources made available through a
pilot IDA Crisis Response Window, and its allocation for FY11-13 is estimated to be about SDR
259 million (US$395 million) per year.8 IFC’s private sector strategy will complement IDA’s
public-sector work. As of February 2010, IFC had committed US$18.3 million in five projects;
it expects to commit about US$140 million for FY10 in more than 10 projects and to achieve a
committed and outstanding investment portfolio of about US$300 million by 2011. MIGA will
continue to offer its guarantee products. Given Kenya’s strong macroeconomic performance and
its large infrastructure needs, various guarantee instruments and the possibility of IBRD enclave
financing is also under consideration. While the CPS does not present low, base or high case
scenarios, any serious erosion of the policy environment or of macroeconomic management will
cause the Bank Group to adjust its strategy, including its investment levels; this adjustment
8

The FY11-13 allocations are indicative only and can change depending on: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii)
Kenya’s performance rating; (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of
IDA’s assistance to Kenya (grants or credits); and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. FY12 and FY13
indicative allocations assume a similar level of replenishment in IDA16 as occurred in IDA15.

19

would be discussed with the Government in the annual lending discussion, and the results of that
discussion would be communicated to the Board in a Progress Report (which would be
accelerated, if necessary).
Objective 1: Unleashing Kenya’s growth potential
47.
In Vision 2030 and the MTP, the Government aims to maintain macroeconomic
stability, ensure good public sector management, encourage private sector development
and improve core infrastructure. The Bank fully supports these objectives. Macroeconomic
management has been strong, resulting in relatively low inflation, a stable exchange rate, and
low interest rates. It is likely that this macroeconomic stability will continue.
Objective 1: Unleashing Kenya’s growth potential
Outcome 1.1: Improving Kenya’s business environment and competitiveness.
Outcome 1.2: Improving core infrastructure, especially in roads, electricity, and water
supply, with a view to deepening regional integration.
Outcome 1.3: Enhancing agricultural productivity, with a special focus on food security.
Outcome 1.4: Strengthening public sector management and improving sub-national
governance, especially in urban areas (where most of Kenya’s GDP is generated).
48.
Outcome 1.1: Improving the business environment and competitiveness. Kenya has
done a lot since 2002 to improve the business environment, including preparing and enacting
many laws. Business licenses were reduced; an e-registry launched; incorporation and property
registration costs decreased; the financial and commercial judicial framework was improved;
and, most significantly, a new land policy was approved. Public-private dialogue also improved
greatly: regular meetings now take place between the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA)
and the President, the Prime Minister, Parliament, and line ministries, and the industrialization
and competitiveness agendas are now firmly anchored in discussion in the National Economic
and Social Council. That said, Kenya’s rank in Doing Business fell as reform in Kenya stalled
while other countries moved ahead, and more can be done to link MSEs with larger enterprises
and to exploit regional markets as the EAC forms a common market.
49.
Reform also enabled the financial sector to grow rapidly -- it is the third largest in
Africa -- and improved access and stability, though vulnerabilities remain. Surging mobile
financial transfers, a growing banking sector, and expanding microfinance and lending to SMEs
dramatically increased the population served by formal financial services (from 26.4 percent in
2006 to 40.5 percent in 2009). At the same time, financial system stability increased
significantly and key reforms were passed, modernizing the sector’s institutional, regulatory and
operational framework. Kenya is now well-placed to exploit opportunities in regional financial
integration. That said, further reform can help to improve access to finance for underserved
sectors and also sustain sector stability. To overcome delays in enacting reforms, capacity
constraints in regulatory and supervisory institutions and bottlenecks in the Attorney General’s
office and in parliament also need to be addressed. The Bank Group will help Kenya in these
areas through:

20







Improving Kenya’s overall investment competitiveness, through reforms that will
reduce the cost of doing business. At the municipal level, this will include IDA support
to improving municipal management and competitiveness, with strong municipal
performers rewarded with financing for larger-scale investments—in part to demonstrate
what stronger performance can achieve. In addition, IFC will continue to help improve
firm competitiveness, particularly of MSMEs.
Accelerating reforms to strengthen the financial sector and make it more responsive
to Kenya’s business needs. The focus will be AAA informing crisis preparedness,
mobile banking, prudential regulation and supervision, operational infrastructure, and
regional integration. The Bank is also supporting demutualization of the stock exchange.
Improving logistics, trade across borders, and regional integration. The Bank Group
is helping to address major constraints such as weak ICT infrastructure, border controls,
traffic congestion in Nairobi and Mombasa, airport security, and standards and
certification issues—so that Kenya can participate more cheaply, easily and fully in
larger markets.
Box 2: Kenya in the East Africa Community

Kenya is the dominant economy in East Africa. It has the third largest financial sector in Africa, a
strong manufacturing base, and is critical for transportation and communications. What happens in
Kenya strongly influences the wider region. A Common Market protocol for the EAC was signed in
November 2009, on the EAC’s 10th anniversary. Allowing for the free movement of goods, people, and
services, this protocol should open up significant trade and investment opportunities in the region.
Monetary union is currently scheduled for 2012.
Achieving the benefits of economic integration requires Kenya and other EAC members to
address numerous challenges. A wide array of non-tariff barriers continues to impede free trade in goods
and add to the costs of doing business; an effective national monitoring committee and timetable for their
removal are essential. Transport costs remain high, due in part to the poor performance of the KenyaUganda rail concession, inefficiency at the port of Mombasa, and dilapidated highways and congestion
around Nairobi on the northern road corridor.
The Bank Group is helping to address many of these challenges, including through regional IDA
projects. IFC has been helping to restructure the Uganda-Kenya Railway concession. Through trade
facilitation projects, IDA has helped to establish the Africa Trade Insurance Agency and to rehabilitate
key infrastructure at the port of Mombasa and at border posts linking Kenya to its neighbors; and it is also
upgrading the northern road corridor in Kenya. An IDA-supported regional communications project has
supported the construction of a landing station for international undersea fibre optic cables and regional
backhaul infrastructure; and a new agricultural productivity program is helping to strengthen regional
centers of excellence in agricultural research and technologies, while a proposed regional health project
will test innovative cross-border approaches to communicable disease control. In addition, IDA is
supporting environmental management around Lake Victoria, through strengthening the Lake Victoria
Basin Commission, improving watershed management and strengthening point-source pollution control
and prevention. Finally, IDA investments in Kenya’s financial, energy and transportation sectors, though
not strictly regional, aim to ensure that regional impacts are fully taken into account—in recognition that
regional economic integration remains a promising gateway to improved prosperity.

21

Outcome 1.2: Improving core infrastructure, especially in roads, electricity, and water
supply.
50.
Transport: Efficient transport interconnection through a network of roads,
railways, airports, and ports is essential to support economic growth. Recent investments
have upgraded trade corridors, reduced urban traffic congestion, and modernized sector
governance (through establishing autonomous road authorities and a fuel levy to fund road
maintenance), but more needs to be done to complete the reforms underway, clear the backlog in
road rehabilitation, ensure value for money and improve road safety. In aviation, the
Government is expanding the Nairobi and Kisumu airports to support trade and tourism.
Efficiency at the port of Mombasa is improving through the introduction of 24-hour operations
and construction of a new container terminal, but transformation is unlikely until Mombasa
becomes a landlord port and stakeholders focus more strongly on strategic development of the
port and its surroundings. The port’s performance will also improve if the railway improves:
currently the railway operates at less than 50 percent of capacity and the concessionaire
introduced in 2006 has not brought the management expertise or additional capital needed. The
Bank has supported Kenya’s transport sector for many years and established an excellent sector
dialogue, and it can continue to contribute to knowledge with technical assistance and AAA
focused on strengthening the capacity of sector institutions in regulation, planning and
operations. The Bank Group will help Kenya to achieve the transport infrastructure it needs for
2030 by:







Continuing to help rehabilitate the northern road corridor, strengthen road sector
institutions, and develop opportunities for private sector financing. This will include
a model PPP transaction to finance tolled bypasses for Nairobi, using guarantees and
possibly IBRD enclave financing. Besides enabling truck traffic to avoid downtown
Nairobi, tolling will help to develop new road-financing options which, through time,
may enable some road companies to list on the stock exchange (opening up other
financing possibilities).
Helping to expand private sector participation in the port of Mombasa, with a view
to establishing it as a world-class landlord port. The objective is to reduce port dwell
times from seven days at present (from 17 several years ago) to just a few days, while
also managing the higher volumes that a growing region needs.
Continuing to support the expansion of JKIA, to strengthen its position as a
regional aviation hub. This will help both tourism and trade (e.g., of fresh produce to
Europe).
Helping to restructure the railway concession. IFC led the effort to concession the
railway, and both IFC and MIGA may be involved in the restructuring.

51.
Electricity: Adequate and reliable supply of affordable electricity is key to economic
growth, security, and delivery of social services. The comprehensive reform program initiated
in 2004 has reached farther than programs in most other Sub-Saharan countries. The sector has
been unbundled and the main public sector companies have significant private ownership. Key
oversight entities have been established which have good track records (e.g., on adjusting tariffs
and concluding power purchase agreements between public generation and distribution
companies). But it is clear that power-sector development cannot be achieved through public
22

investment alone. Large-scale private sector investments in generation and transmission will be
needed as well. Government policy and the regulatory environment strongly support private
sector participation, both in large scale and distributed generation projects. In addition,
procurement oversight mechanisms have been invoked on several major contract awards, leading
to greater confidence in the processes. Many positive outcomes have resulted, including 200,000
new connections annually; the addition of five IPPs to the grid by 2010 (25 percent of installed
capacity); the establishment of KenGen and KPLC as financially-viable public companies; and
significant reductions in system losses. The Government is committed to completing sector
reforms while addressing remaining challenges, including limited generation capacity (about
1,600 MW), high international energy prices, hydrological uncertainty, limited private sector
interest following the global financial crisis, and a poor record of timely execution of capital
investment programs by the public companies. The Bank Group will help by:




Mobilizing concessional and private sector financing to expand electricity
generation, with a preference for renewables and IPPs, as well as transmission and
distribution. This will help to meet the Government’s ambitious on- and off-grid
connection targets. In all areas, guarantees and IBRD enclave financing will be
considered. In addition, the Bank will seek to advance the interconnection of the power
systems of the East African countries.
Further strengthening key sector institutions.

52.
Water: Kenya is a water-scarce country, with rapidly-growing water demand. Its
per capita water endowment is about 600m3 per year; its storage capacity about 5m3; and only 55
percent of Kenyans have access to safe drinking water. Severe degradation of its five water
catchment areas has contributed to this water crisis. To meet rising demand, Kenya needs to
promote sustainable water development along with efficient water services management. To this
end, the Government has created new institutions that separate responsibilities for legislation and
policy making, regulation, asset ownership, and service provision, but these new institutions
need further strengthening for decentralized management to work. In addition, investments in
water services, watershed management and hydraulic infrastructure are needed. The Bank can
help Kenya by:





Identifying and developing a new water supply source for Nairobi. The city’s
population has doubled since the last reservoir was built in the 1980s, and water
shortages are common.
Further clarifying roles and responsibilities within the water sector by helping to
transfer water and sanitation assets to the water services boards.
Identifying private sector financing for small-scale municipal water supply systems.
An ongoing Water is Life program uses output-based aid for small-scale systems
targeting the poor and will be scaled-up.
Expanding irrigation, including through innovative demand-driven financing
mechanisms for small- and large-scale irrigation, involving PPPs to maximize leverage
and increase coverage.

53.
Outcome 1.3: Enhanced agricultural productivity, with a focus on food security.
Work is underway to improve productivity; expand irrigation, fish farming, and disease-free
23

zones; and provide smallholders with access to cheaper farm inputs. There has been some
progress in implementing sector reforms but some important ones, like eliminating the maize
producer price support, meet effective resistance from vocal losers. The fragmentation of sector
ministries in the coalition government has resulted in inefficiency, and procurement is still
associated with low expenditures and high corruption, especially in maize, sugar, meat and
fertilizer. Finally, budgetary allocations to agriculture remain low and tend to go to operations
and maintenance, reducing investments and spreading them thinly over the many ministries and
districts. The Bank has been active in the sector for many years, with mixed success. Ongoing
support aims at:





Reactivating stalled policy reforms, clarifying the mandates of the sector ministries,
and reforming the commodity-based parastatals (sugar, livestock and cereals).
Government intervention in the maize and seeds markets needs to be reduced, in order to
enhance the value of existing and encourage future private investment. Improvements
are also needed in the provision of services such as research and extension and inputs
such as seeds and fertilizers, including through private service providers.
Promoting farm and non-farm (agribusiness) sources of growth. To this end, IDA
and IFC will work together to promote market-based approaches.
Supporting investments in arid and semi-arid lands. Ongoing IDA and GEF
interventions will seek to promote adaptation to climate change and sustainable land
management.
Box 3: Gender Mainstreaming in the Agriculture Sector

Experience shows that gender issues are most effectively addressed early in project design and that
incorporating gender enhances the quality of operations and contributes to poverty reduction and
good governance. One example in the Kenya portfolio is the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and
Agribusiness Project (KAPAP), which integrates gender concerns in design, implementation, and
monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Gender strategies are developed for each project component,
targets are set for the participation of women in project activities, responsibilities for gender
mainstreaming are clearly specified, and sex-disaggregated information is gathered. The project also
includes specific investments aiming to strengthen women’s economic empowerment and
participation in decision-making processes, so that women can retain control of their income. Other
capacity-building initiatives include investing in participation and leadership skills training of women
in higher-level decision-making structures, and a mentorship program specifically targeted to
enabling successful agribusiness entrepreneurs among young women and men to reach out within
their communities. In collaboration with other development partners, KAPAP is establishing a robust
and systematic set of gender-disaggregated baseline data in agriculture and related sectors. This data
will provide input to the agricultural sector gender policy, and the Bank is maintaining a close
dialogue with the gender policy task force, to ensure that data meet the client’s needs. The Bank will
use the lessons learned from this experience in the agricultural sector to assist other sectors as well.

54.
Outcome 1.4: Strengthening public sector management, including at sub-national
levels. Vision 2030 and the MTP specify that the Government will promote results-based
management in the public service. In fact, service delivery and accountability have been
improving since the 2006 launch of public sector and public financial management reforms.
Public servants are beginning to focus on citizen-centered services and improved partnership
24

with other actors (e.g., civil society and unions). But much more remains to be done. The Bank
aims to help Kenya to improve its performance by:






Continuing to enhance transparency and accountability in PFM. At the national
level, the Bank will help to complete the roll-out of IFMIS, and it may help to roll-out a
financial management system for local authorities.
Improving public procurement, including through undertaking a procurement
assessment review to strengthen the institutional framework and management capacity,
enhance competitiveness, and improve system integrity and transparency.
Strengthening the capacity of selected oversight institutions. IDA will deepen work
already underway to strengthen the capacity of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) to
complete forensic audits. Where opportunities exist, it will also seek to strengthen the
capacity and professionalism of parliament and of the judiciary.
Transitioning the public service from a process to a results orientation and focus on
citizens’ satisfaction with service delivery, including through third-party monitoring.

Objective 2: Reducing inequality and social exclusion
55.
Vision 2030 and the MTP rightly emphasize the need for Kenya to reduce inequality
and social exclusion. CPIA ratings show that Kenya lags its EAC peers most visibly in the
indicators that measure policies for equity and social inclusion It is also in this area where the
MDGs (for health) are most off-track. The Government recognizes a need to improve access to
good-quality basic services in education, health, water and sanitation. It has also initiated efforts
to improve social safety nets, particularly for the under-covered urban poor, in light of the
vulnerabilities exposed by the 2008-09 crises.
Objective 2: Reducing inequality and social exclusion
Outcome 2.1: Improving access to health care, education and basic infrastructure services.
Outcome 2.2: Establishing comprehensive and scalable social protection mechanisms.

Outcome 2.1: Improving access to health care, education and basic infrastructure services.
56.
While progress in education has been good, the provision of health care and water
and sanitation services are lagging behind. The 2003 introduction of free primary education
dramatically lifted national education indicators, though large regional disparities remain. The
key issues now are teacher quality and distribution at the primary level, and access to secondary
and tertiary education, especially for girls. By contrast, the track record on health care is mixed.
Recent data show significant improvements in infant and child mortality rates, probably due to
increased child immunization and use of anti-malarial bed nets, but contraceptive prevalence,
though increasing, remains far below the MDG target, and skilled attendance at birth (44
percent) is largely unchanged since 1993. In addition, overall adult HIV prevalence increased
slightly over 2003 to 2007, indicating a need to strengthen preventative measures. Water and
sanitation remain seriously off-track. Only about half of Kenyans have access to safe water and
basic sanitation facilities, with the situation worse in slums and rural areas. Ensuring greater
equity in access to basic services is vital to poorer Kenyans, as it will help to enable them to
exploit opportunities to improve their livelihoods. The Bank Group will help Kenya by:
25







Supporting the Kenya Education Sector Support Program (KESSP). IDA will
continue to play a key role in strengthening financial management and accountability and
addressing issues such as access, the quality of instruction, and efficiency of education
spending. AAA will focus on making education and training more responsive to
businesses, with a focus on youth employment and entrepreneurship and higher access to
higher education.
Strengthening health systems. IDA is a key player in preparing a sector-wide approach
(SWAp) focused on strengthening health systems and will also prepare a regional project
to test innovative cross-border approaches to communicable disease control. In addition,
IFC will catalyze improvements in access to health-related goods and services in Kenya,
with an emphasis on the underserved.
Expanding access to water, in slums and in arid and semi-arid areas, as well as
access to sanitation in slums. A proposed slum-upgrading program will support
infrastructure investments in drainage, water and sanitation—but also access roads,
electricity and street lighting (with positive impacts on security).

57.
Outcome 2.2:
Establishing comprehensive and scalable social protection
mechanisms. Kenya needs to have systems in place to mitigate the impact of shocks,
particularly on the poor. Temporary shocks can have long-term consequences, both within a
family and across an economy. Social protection systems that help address these shocks are an
important part of developing a balanced growth strategy. To this end, Kenya has developed an
early warning system in the ASALs that allows assistance to be rapidly targeted in response to
weather-related food insecurity. It also recently developed cash transfer programs for orphans
and vulnerable children, the elderly, and the chronically food-insecure in the arid lands and in
urban slums as well as targeted programs for the disabled and unemployed youth. A low-cost
health insurance scheme is also being piloted. Scaled-up and coordinated, these programs can
provide a comprehensive system of social protection, and also lower the risk that destitute people
will resort to crime and violence to secure their needs. The Bank supports this important agenda
by working with the Government in the following key areas:




Developing and implementing a comprehensive social protection policy. This will
need to define priority target groups and a clear institutional framework with the capacity
to deliver social protection programming. It should also consolidate existing government
and donor investments in the sector and support increasing harmonization around a
government-led and financed program.
Supporting selected social protection systems. This includes support for the ASAL
drought management system, cash transfers for orphans and vulnerable children, and the
Kazi kwa Vijana (Work for Youth) program. In each area, IDA’s focus is on establishing
strong accountability frameworks, targeting mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation
systems. The overall aim is to show that it is possible to target the poorest households,
even in challenging environments such as urban slums and in the ASALs, in partnership
with NGOs and local communities, and also that transfers improve household welfare,
contribute to human capital formation, and generate local multiplier effects.

26

Objective 3: Managing resource constraints and environmental challenges
58.
The third CPS objective focuses on improving natural resources, with a special
focus on climate change and disaster responsiveness. Kenya needs to improve climate-related
disaster preparedness and response and adapt its institutions and policies to climate variability
and uncertainty—including rising sea-levels, increasing aridity and more unpredictable rainfall
and flooding. Attention will need to be given particularly to the arid and semi-arid lands, coastal
ecosystems, and agriculture-dependent communities on more marginal lands. Flexibility in the
face of a dynamic and uncertain environment will be key.
Objective 3: Managing resource constraints and environmental challenges
Outcome 3.1: Improving management of key natural resources.
Outcome 3.2: Adapting to climate change.
59.
Outcome 3.1: Managing land and water resources, especially in key water
catchment areas. The challenge is acute for Kenya, as 80 percent of its land is arid or semi-arid
and the population is growing by about one million people each year, in a context where the land
use patterns are not adequately sensitive to the ecosystem fragility. The Bank will help by:





Supporting the development and implementation of a comprehensive environment
and natural resources management policy that prioritizes these issues in national
planning and budgets and engages responsible agencies in a cross-sectoral manner, with a
focus on agricultural technology; infrastructure investment; energy, water, and
transportation policy and pricing; and management of the “water towers”—the Mau,
Aberdare and Cherangani Forests, Mount Kenya and Mount Elgin. It will also include
creating urban plans that demarcate environmental assets and sensitive sites and provide
support for improved urban environmental and land use management.
Providing technical assistance to land tenure reform and land administration
systems, with a particular focus on tenure regularization in urban slums.
Supporting investments that reduce vulnerability of farmers and pastoralists to
weather shocks through income diversification, livestock irrigation, and improved soil
and water conservation.

27

Box 4: Land Reform in Kenya, and the role of the Bank
Land use and tenure have been contentious issues in Kenya, which is characterized by high levels
of inequality and landlessness, illegal and irregular allocation of public land, and inefficiencies and
corruption in land administration and management. These issues are particularly vexing in the 20 percent
of the land that is arable. In 1960, as Kenya prepared for independence, seven million acres (or about half
of cultivated land) was in the hands of European settlers. A post-independence land reform program
transferred land from Europeans to Africans, but did not return land to all of those who were landless or
had been dispossessed. The resulting landlessness and concentrated land ownership were exacerbated by
political patronage and corruption, especially through illegal and irregular allocation of public land. As a
result, about 15 million people in rural parts of the country are landless or own less than two acres of land.
In early December 2009, Parliament adopted a new land policy. The policy inter alia seeks to
restore the historic claims of indigenous communities; develop new land tenure systems and laws;
recognize community, indigenous and customary land rights; and introduce land banking to ensure that
the state has land for emergency services.
The Bank has provided some assistance to land reform efforts in Kenya, including in preparation
of the new land policy. It also provided financial support to safeguarding, improving and computerizing
land records, developing a National Resettlement Policy, and sharing international experience in land
redistribution and restitution. In addition, a project is being prepared to support formalizing the land
rights of urban slum dwellers, with a view to upgrading their infrastructure and social services. Given the
complexity of land issues in Kenya, and the powerful vested interests in the status quo, land reform is
likely to take decades to accomplish.

60.
Outcome 3.2: Kenya faces many climate change risks and opportunities, which
could have profound consequences for its development. The Government has developed a
national climate change response strategy that sets out both adaptation and mitigation measures
to address: (i) climate variability stresses on agricultural and natural ecosystems; (ii) increasing
water shortages and regional differences in water availability; (iii) shortening growing periods;
and (iv) intensifying rainfall, which may increase the magnitude and frequency of flooding and
the destruction of infrastructure. Bank assistance under this CPS will help Kenya to promote
“climate-smart” development by:



IV.

Integrating climate risk management into national and local development planning
in agriculture and natural resource management in the ASALs (with GEF support).
Improving energy efficiency and ensuring energy security while also protecting
investments that aim to achieve higher levels of development. This will require
diversifying the sources of energy away from thermal sources to renewables; achieving
greater energy efficiency; developing high-density cities with good public transportation;
and supporting the traditional biomass sector (such that, e.g., charcoal exploitation is
sustainable).
Implementing the Country Partnership Strategy for FY10-13

61.
Experience shows that the economic, social and political circumstances of Kenya
may change unexpectedly and the Bank Group should respond with an appropriate
adjustment in the balance of instruments it deploys to assist the development agenda. The
CPS envisages a broad engagement in Kenya, with investment lending, DPLs, technical
assistance and AAA. If political instability or corruption were to undermine the management of
28

the IDA portfolio, it may be necessary to shift the balance of Bank Group support more towards
AAA and technical assistance, especially in areas where the Bank Group can effectively advance
a knowledge strategy.
Knowledge strategy
62.
In a rapidly-evolving global environment, the Bank’s relevance to Kenya will
increasingly depend on its ability to mobilize global knowledge and to connect it to local
networks. Sustained efforts to provide neutral and disinterested advocacy in Kenya’s best
interests have enabled the Bank more recently to emerge as a trusted, committed and pragmatic
partner. The Bank Group will strive to generate and use knowledge not only through its
analytical research but also through its lending—which offers a unique combination of financing
and technical knowledge in a product that is available from few other partners, public or private.
Moreover, all Bank Group activities, whether lending or non-lending, will aim to scale-up policy
and institutional reform, technological innovation, and improved project management.
63.
The Bank cannot confine itself to being an “expert”, but must operate in
partnership with the many Kenyan researchers and agencies that are bringing global
practices to bear in Kenya. Partnerships with the private sector could provide ways of using
cutting-edge global technology for development purposes. For example, the Bank plans to
partner with the mobile-phone industry and benefit from Kenya’s high mobile phone density (up
to 80 percent of Kenyans above 15 years old are projected to own a mobile phone in 2010),
exploiting opportunities to target cash transfers and collect just-in-time data on local conditions.
64.
The World Bank wants to be engaged in Kenya’s vibrant knowledge sector and has
the potential to play an important leadership role. The following three principles will shape
the nature of the Bank’s knowledge program:






The Bank will work as much as possible with local partners, inside and outside of
Government, including academia, think tanks and others. Over the medium term, the
Bank’s role will become one of adviser – particularly on international practices and
quality improvements – rather than taking the lead in doing the research directly.
Knowledge with impact involves strategic communication. In-depth studies will be
complemented with “just-in-time” policy advice and shorter and more frequent analyses
that are designed to inform local debate. Interactive dissemination (including blogs,
videos, and an interactive website) will be used more actively. The Bank Group’s
knowledge products will be evaluated by website traffic, media exposure and uptake in
official policy discussions.
Knowledge will inform lending, and lending will generate knowledge as well as provide
opportunities for experimentation. Our future knowledge products will be organized
around the three core engagements of the CPS: (i) unleashing growth; (ii) ensuring
equity; and (iii) improving environmental sustainability (see Table 4 and Annex 2), with
improving governance as an overall objective.

Lending
65.
The bulk of IDA financing to Kenya over the CPS period is expected to be in the
form of investment lending. This is appropriate, given the heavy concentration of proposed
lending in large-scale infrastructure, where IDA support to contract-level procurement and
financial management will help to leverage significant concessional and private sector financing.
In some of the social sectors—e.g., health and education—the Bank will develop and maintain
SWAps that involve sector-level budget support. Investments in water services, watershed
management are planned to help reduce the impact of climate change on water availability. In
general, in a climate of flat real budgets within the Bank Group, the country team will aim to
prepare fewer but larger projects to ensure that the Bank’s administrative budget adequately
covers all project preparation and implementation costs, while also supporting the policy
dialogue, technical assistance, and analytic work needed to maintain and expand our knowledge
base.
66.
While Kenya continues to face a number of governance challenges, a well designed
development policy lending program (DPL) can help address them. As in many other
countries with weak governance, DPLs can help the Government to plan its financing needs,
establish a framework for policy reform dialogue, and help reform-minded counterparts to
identify and implement key reforms, complemented by knowledge products and TA operations.
With the support of the Bank, the Government has embarked on a number of important
reforms—in public financial management, financial and private sector development, and service
delivery—that could be supported through DPLs. These reforms include upgrading the audit
system, rolling out IFMIS, passing an anti-money laundering law, reducing business start-up
times, and establishing a targeted transfer system.
67.
While continuing to adhere to strong macroeconomic policies, the Government has
also made important progress in public financial management, investment climate reform,
and service delivery in recent years. In particular, Kenya has established a strong track record
in the financial sector, which has increased access and improved stability. A first DPL series
would build on these ongoing reforms and a growing policy dialogue in these areas. If the
government continues to make substantial progress in these areas, the Bank, in consultation with
its development partners, may prepare a DPL during the CPS period (see Box 5).

 Implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).
 Further upgrading of the Internal Audit Department.
 Action plan in place for the implementation of the anti-money laundering law.

 Passing of key laws and regulations to support the private sector (e.g., companies act,
revisions to the banking act).
 Deepening financial sector governance through broadening ownership of the Nairobi Stock
Exchange and strengthening of the Capital Markets Authority.
 Improved trade facilitation, especially reducing the dwell time in the port of Mombasa.
Service Delivery
 Strengthening selected social protection systems, especially their targeting and monitoring and
evaluation.
 Developing and implementing a comprehensive social protection strategy.

68.
A number of completed and ongoing analyses could inform a future DPL program.
In 2009, the Government of Kenya, development partners and the World Bank launched a joint
program of public expenditure analysis which will result in a first joint public expenditure review
in 2010. In addition, public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessments have
been carried out twice (2006 and 2008) and a country procurement assessment review is planned
for FY11. In addition, the Bank has already completed a poverty assessment (2009), an
investment climate assessment (2008), and a country economic memorandum (2008), and it
recently launched a program of bi-annual Economic Updates.
Mainstreaming governance
69.
The Bank Group will seek to build responsive, capable and accountable state
agencies through all of its activities. In keeping with the Bank’s 2007 governance and anticorruption strategy, the Bank Group will remain engaged in sectors that are vital to Kenya’s
development. With Bank Group disbursements less than 2 percent of government spending, the
Group’s impact will derive mainly from its ability to influence and improve public spending, so
that it creates opportunities for poor people, provides better services, and improves development
outcomes. Concretely, this implies Bank Group work to:




Understand sector-wide issues: Where the Bank chooses to engage in a sector, it will: (i)
undertake sector-based political-economy analytical work to understand more precisely the
governance impediments to achieving each sector’s development objectives and (ii) work
closely with the Bank’s technical specialists to devise options to address these impediments,
drawing on global experiences of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
Such studies are already underway in the areas of land, agriculture, and transportation.
Continue supporting improved “supply side” accountability by pursuing reforms in
fiscal management, public procurement, government accounting and auditing, and the
31









civil service. This work remains at the heart of the Bank’s partnership with the Government
of Kenya, and would be supported in any development policy loan (see Outcome 1.4).
Expand “demand side” accountability mechanisms, both in Bank-funded and
Government programs. This will involve support to devolve and decentralize services
(e.g., through the planned municipal program); strengthen oversight agencies; and promote
transparency, participation and third-party monitoring of government activities. A twopronged approach will be pursued: (i) the Government will be encouraged to enhance
information flows and ensure private sector representation on key oversight entities; and (ii)
the Bank will help build the capacity of stakeholders to use this information to review
government and private sector activities, including especially in service delivery, to assess
performance and demand accountability. Where the Bank is supporting policy or
institutional reform, it will also seek to ensure that the reform brings visible improvements in
service delivery and so creates a new set of stakeholders that will help to prevent backsliding.
Undertake political economy work to determine where there are real reform
opportunities—which the Bank will support aggressively—and where opportunities do
not exist. The Bank will attempt to achieve difficult reforms only if there is a politicallycapable group of champions supporting the reforms as well as an environment that will
enable their achievement. Where the Bank pilots new approaches, the pilots will be scalable,
so that successful ones can achieve transformative impacts.
Set and enforce high standards for managing Bank resources. The Bank Group will
work with others -- in and outside government -- to fight fraud, corruption and poor
administration. Where corruption risks are high, it is important for the Bank to set high
standards, remain vigilant, investigate evidence of wrongdoing and take decisive action when
wrongdoing is found.9
Build coalitions for addressing governance and anti-corruption challenges at the
country level, through partnering with other donors, stakeholders such as parliament, and
organizations like Transparency International and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance
(KEPSA). In Kenya, the Bank will also work with the media, which has been very effective
in exposing wrongdoing and holding public agencies accountable, including at high levels of
government.

Mainstreaming gender

70.
The CPS intends to help the Government to reach its Vision 2030 objective of
achieving gender equity in power and resource distribution and meet its commitment
under the MDGs. The main challenge is to ensure that existing and new development programs
support recent positive trends. The Bank will continue to promote women’s empowerment in
productive economic sectors such as agriculture, water, and energy. In addition, it will continue
to work with the Government to establish the evidence base regarding the effects of gender
equality in poverty reduction operations, build the gender-mainstreaming capacity of its clients,
and partner with other stakeholders on gender equality and women’s economic empowerment.

9

This was done in September 2009, when the Government’s own Internal Audit Department found evidence of
fraud and corruption in two Bank-funded projects: implicated staff were dismissed, project finances were frozen
pending a thorough, misspent funds were identified for reimbursement to the Bank, and an action plan was
formulated—in consultation with INT—to open the path to a resumption of operations.

32

Supporting implementation
71.
The CPS transforms the Bank’s partnership with Kenya by explicitly recognizing
that the Bank’s service delivery model needs to become even more client-focused. From an
organizational viewpoint, the Bank Group is well-positioned to deliver the CPS program, which
stresses constant implementation support rather than episodic supervision efforts. Both IDA and
IFC are largely decentralized to Nairobi, and the supervision of almost all operations is currently
led from the field. In the case of IDA, 20 of 21 tasks are managed from the field in comparison
to just one task in 2004. Budgets are broadly adequate, though the flat budget environment is
forcing increasing concentration in fewer larger operations, with some loss in the Bank Group’s
ability to provide full-service cross-sectoral advisory support. While individual sector teams
remain responsible for their outputs, the core Country Team, represented by the sector leaders, is
managing for key results using a cross-sectoral approach. IDA, IFC and MIGA results are
integrated into the CPS results matrix, notably in infrastructure, agribusiness and the financial
sector, ensuring that the Bank Group works together to leverage private sector financing
wherever possible.
72.
IDA begins this new CPS cycle with a large ongoing portfolio, consisting of 21
projects (16 national and five regional) and a total commitment of about US$1.75 billion
(30 percent disbursed). Three credits exited and ten new credits entered the portfolio over FY0509. Low disbursement levels partly reflect inactivity due to the 2008 post-election violence as
well as a slow start for large infrastructure projects (with long lead times, from design to contract
award and then to payment of the contractor), but delays also result from complex project design,
cumbersome Bank and government procedures, and limited capacity in the responsible Treasury
department. A portfolio review in June 2009 helped to identify some of the issues slowing
implementation, and the Government subsequently agreed an action plan that includes closer
supervision, additional technical assistance, real-time problem-solving, and short-term
disbursement targets (to be tracked jointly by the Bank and the Government) to ensure more
rapid and effective absorption of Bank funds. The decentralization of the portfolio management
function and high level attention given by the Nairobi Country Office as well as Treasury also
supports this focus.
73.
The Bank Group will actively engage in efforts to build the technical capacity of
implementing agencies, including measures to improve quality at entry and project
implementation. This will focus particularly on projects in problem status, so that mitigating
measures can be taken in a timely manner. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to
government agencies to strengthen fiduciary and audit functions, and will attempt to be more
strategic, engaging only in areas where the Bank has a definite comparative advantage, strong
partners, and joint commitments to deliver results. Where operations have been successful,
teams will continue to pursue additional financing, reducing transaction costs and accelerating
the delivery of needed investment resources. Teams will also be allocated modest resources to
develop project ideas and to make the business case for new operations.
74.
Project supervision will remain intensive, with enhanced implementation support.
Infrastructure investments and CDD projects represent a higher share of the portfolio, requiring
more focused supervision to address quality issues and corruption risks. Supervision will be
enhanced through: (i) introduction of risk-based approaches; (ii) more resources for risky
33

projects; (iii) better physical verification of works through on-site visits and focus on GAC
aspects of the project; and (iv) a greater reliance on civil society organizations in monitoring and
implementation. Results will be monitored through a series of Portfolio Performance Reviews, to
be conducted regularly with the government. Given the corruption risks that exist,
implementation support will also extend to post-procurement contract management to ensure that
goods and services represent value-for-money and are properly delivered and installed. Greater
emphasis will be placed on compliance audits and on effective handling of complaints. In
addition, business and civil society organizations will be actively engaged to identify and
marginalize companies that are known to underperform.
75.
The Bank will use results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to assess how
Bank activities are contributing to results on the ground. Monitoring progress will also
enable corresponding adjustments in the Bank’s lending and non-lending programs. The Bank
will also contribute to Kenya’s own capacity to manage for results. The Bank will support this
through:
(i) Strengthening project supervision, including: incorporating lessons learned from the
CAS CR in the design of new projects (particularly in PFM and agriculture), physically
verifying works, and making full use of the Nairobi-based team;
(ii) Undertaking analytical work on the impact of public policies and investments, for
example, in roads;
(iii) Monitoring CPS results, using the Country Program Monitoring Tool and annual
CPPRs;
(iv) Using evidence-based analysis, including benchmarking from international surveys
(BEEPS, Doing Business) and performance ratings (CPA, PEFA); and
(v) Improving multimedia efforts to raise awareness about results through stories of
successful impact.
76.
In line with the Bank’s overall strategic directions, it will also be important to
continue progressively to move towards the use of country systems in Kenya, recognizing
that it will take time. Bank projects will now shift to using the Treasury system for maintaining
designated accounts (the Treasury system has been assessed and complies with basic Bank
requirements). Other financial management responsibilities are handled through regular Bank
procedures, and project implementing agencies have overall satisfactory financial management
arrangements. As the Government improves its financial management systems, including
auditing, the Bank will assess its ability to utilize them.
Fostering stronger partnerships
77.
The Bank has established strong partnerships with Kenya’s development partners.
The key donors, in terms of financial transfers, are the US Government (mostly off budget),
followed by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, DFID and the European Union,
though some donors who do not publish their aid, like China, are thought also to be within this
group.
78.
The Bank plays a key role in government-development partner coordination. The
Donor Coordination Group (DCG), jointly chaired by the World Bank and a bilateral
34

Ambassador, meets monthly to discuss political and economic developments and to reach
consensus for addressing them. In addition to these high-level fora, about a dozen sector groups
coordinate development partner support in specific areas behind the government’s program.
Currently, the Bank leads or co-leads four of the groups (urban and local government, health and
HIV/AIDS, private sector development, and gender). Most groups meet quarterly with
government counterparts, in a gathering chaired by a Permanent Secretary. In addition, the Bank
is organizing a twice-yearly meeting of a Partnership Forum, which brings together key
government officials and all development partners (including the UN and non-traditional
partners such as China, India and various Arab states) to discuss Kenya’s development
challenges and opportunities (the first such meeting was held in November 2009).
79.
A major achievement in the effort to harmonize development partner support was
the launch of the Kenya Joint Assistance Strategy (KJAS) in September 2007. This is a
joint strategy of 17 major development partners, including the World Bank, for 2007-12.10 It
aims to align development partner assistance with country objectives and facilitate common
implementation mechanisms. It also contains targets for harmonization, in line with those set out
in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The KJAS partners have signed partnership
principles with the Government, which form part of the KJAS. In light of the significant changes
in Kenya’s circumstances since the KJAS was finalized, it will be revised and updated in 2010.
80.
A fundamental goal of the KJAS is to improve the development impact of available
resources by promoting a more effective division of labor among development partners,
better aligning assistance with government programs, and coordinating assistance more
effectively among the partners themselves. KJAS partners have agreed to rationalize their
engagement in sectors, and some have decided to delegate management of their funds to another
partner. This has reduced the burden on government of dealing with multiple development
partners. In tandem, partners have consistently sought new modalities for delivering aid more
effectively. They are increasingly coordinating sector support through SWAps, including for
public financial management reform and education, and are trying to form a SWAp in health as
well. In addition, they have adopted joint financing arrangements for government institutions
such as the National Environmental Management Authority and the Agriculture Sector
Coordination Unit. Development partners have also committed increasingly to use government
systems to manage their development aid, in step with improvements with the quality of public
financial management, and they are also increasingly carrying out analytical work jointly. In
light of these commitments, and as KJAS integration strengthens, the Bank Group will seek ways
to exit, in an orderly fashion, from sectors where it does not take the lead or its contribution is
more marginal, so that it can be more selective and consolidate its support in areas where it can
be transformative.
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
81.
Kenya has an active and vibrant CSO sector, with over 1,000 registered CSOs and
thousands of other welfare groups and associations that cut across many sectors and issues.
10

The KJAS partners are Canada, Denmark, the European Commission (EC), Finland, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, the African Development
Bank, and the United Nations.

35

The most active ones are focused on governance, human rights and impunity, democracy, media,
land issues, public sector performance, human development, HIV/AIDS, women rights and the
environment. A few are particularly vocal on budget issues, corruption and abuse of office, the
constitutional review, post-election violence, and the rights of displaced persons. Some of the
CSOs are established, with good governance structures, and have developed strong partnerships
with local and international institutions in their field of operations.
82.
The Bank regularly and extensively engages CSO leaders in dialogue and
consultations, including consultations for the CPS and pipeline projects. A wide cross
section of CSOs was involved in the many rounds of consultations during the preparation of this
CPS in late 2009 and early 2010. This active engagement focuses on sharing knowledge,
enhancing dialogue and receiving feedback on critical development issues. The consultations
have most recently focused on the relevance of the three strategic themes of the CPS to Kenya’s
development challenges. Future work will seek to enable CSOs, professional organizations and
other non-state actors such as the media and the private sector, effectively to demand
accountability, including through making innovative use of Kenya’s growing proficiency in
information and communications technology.
Strategic Communications
83.
The communication function lies at the heart of the CPS. Carefully and completely
carried out, a strategic communication plan to accompany CPS implementation will provide
information for all stakeholders, inspire their curiosity to know more, and provoke debate. To
this end, many of the Bank’s projects will support increased stakeholder feedback and
involvement in order to improve development outcomes. Further, many policies (for example, in
social and health sector reforms) would benefit from transparency and public participation on
how they are being implemented and how citizens can make the most use of them. Therefore,
the Bank will scale up its communications strategy on its own work, and assist the Government
in doing so more broadly. This could, for example, include working with the Government and
other donors to regularly host workshops and seminars around key policy issues for a wide
audience. The Bank Group will also use a wide range of interactive dissemination techniques
which will include blogs, texts, videos, and an interactive website to promote its analytical work,
including the bi-annual Economic Updates. The Bank’s knowledge products will be evaluated
by website traffic, media exposure, messaging, and uptake in official policy discussions.
V.

Managing Risks

84.
The CPS will be implemented during a period of considerable risks and uncertainty.
Political risks feature most prominently. The 2012 elections as well as a referendum on the
constitution, expected in 2010, are two important political milestones that could, if poorly
managed, inflame tensions, jeopardize peace and security, and derail the ability of the Bank
Group to deliver on the CPS program. While most observers believe that the current coalition
government will survive until the next elections, they also believe that tension, infighting, and
conflict will become more pronounced as the referendum and election approach, with the result
that deep reform will become increasingly difficult to accomplish. Under these circumstances, it
is important for the Bank to focus on what is possible, help sustain momentum within the
government’s economic development program, build support for reforms across all parts of the
36

coalition government as well as with civil society and the private sector, and remain flexible in
its own programming so that it can adjust its approach in response to changing circumstances. In
the unlikely circumstance that the Government becomes unable to function normally—for
example, due to widespread violence associated with the constitutional referendum or the 2012
elections or a collapse of the coalition government—the CPS Progress Report would be
accelerated and a new strategy articulated in light of that development.
85.
There is also a risk that macroeconomic achievements will be reversed, particularly
as new elections approach in 2012. Public officials may opt to support lower-priority projects
that are believed to have electoral benefits, in a context of relaxed fiscal discipline. Working
closely with the Treasury, the IMF and other donors, the Bank will seek to ensure that costbenefit analyses are undertaken and applied and that appropriate macroeconomic policies remain
in place throughout the pre-election period and beyond.
86.
With an economy that is relatively integrated into the EAC and the global economy,
Kenya is vulnerable to external shocks. The global financial crisis depressed the prices of
Kenyan commodity exports and negatively impacted growth, especially in tourism. At the same
time, Kenya in 2008-09 felt the full impact of a global increase in oil and fertilizer prices, which
greatly exacerbated already serious shortages of maize. While Kenya should not (and is unlikely
to) abandon its efforts to integrate more fully into the global economy, prudent macroeconomic
management, such as it practiced in the early and mid-2000s, will remain key to providing the
fiscal space for the Government to adjust appropriately to external shocks when they occur.
87.
Kenya is also vulnerable to climate change, due in particular to its reliance on
rainfall both for agricultural growth and energy production. Extremes of drought and
flooding are becoming increasingly common, and Kenya’s high historical reliance on
hydroelectric power concentrated on a single river course (the Tana) needs to be reduced. To
help Kenya to adapt to the destructive impacts of climate change, the Bank Group will strengthen
its support for government efforts to manage the environment, adapt economic and social
structures that better accommodate changing environmental circumstances, and diversify
electricity generation away from hydroelectricity to other green sources such as geothermal.
88.
Another external shock that may impact Kenya is terrorism—given its history of past
terrorist attacks, the significant presence of international agencies that have been terrorist targets
in other countries, and its proximity to countries believed to harbor terrorist organizations. To
help mitigate the risks of terrorist attacks, the Government is working closely with international
intelligence agencies to monitor terrorist movements and take appropriate action as needed.
89.
The Kenya program also remains subject to project management and fiduciary
risks. In the current environment of political uncertainty and corruption, program-specific risks
assume even greater prominence. To mitigate these risks, the Bank plans to provide training and
undertake risk-based supervision missions to help build capacity and ensure adequate controls
are in place for financial transactions and accuracy in financial reporting, audit and
disbursement. In addition, the Bank will apply lessons learned from the CAS Completion Report
on the risks to implementing agricultural and PFM projects, in particular. Steps to mitigate these
risks are discussed in the sections on the portfolio and on governance. In the event that political
37

or fiduciary risks seriously undermine the integrity of the portfolio, the program may have to be
cut back or otherwise revised.
VI.

Conclusion

90.
Kenya did well over 2003-07, and it can do better still. Starting in 2003-04, Kenya
embarked on reforms that brought about the first sustained period of per capita economic growth
in three decades, reduced poverty significantly, reduced infant and child mortality rates,
introduced free primary education, and eliminated a lot of bureaucratic red tape, thus enabling
businesses to invest, grow and create jobs. But, as the setbacks of 2008-09 show, past success is
no guarantee of future success: many countries have done well for a period only to stagnate
later. For Kenya to continue to grow and reduce poverty, it will need to secure the passage of a
new constitution with the checks and balances that Kenya needs; continue to make the
infrastructure investments needed to secure future growth; and establish a stronger business
environment, inter alia by dealing decisively with corruption (the issue that, for many
stakeholders inside and outside of Kenya, is the key for Kenya’s prospects). It will also need to
ensure that growth is equitably distributed and environmentally sustainable. In many of these
areas, no one knows exactly what sort of policy and institutional reforms will work best in
Kenya. Research remains a crucial input into the Government’s policy debates, and the Bank
Group—by embedding global knowledge and experience in its research, technical assistance,
lending projects and transactions—is better positioned than most of Kenya’s development
partners to introduce innovative solutions to Kenya’s development problems and evaluate the
results so that Kenya can learn what reforms are successful and should be scaled-up. The World
Bank Group is pleased to support Kenya’s development and will work hard with the Government
to bring lasting prosperity to all Kenyans, including particularly the poor.

Annex 4: World Bank Group Program Integration
IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA are working together to respond to the challenges Kenya faces in
implementing its development program. The Bank Group is more effective when its constituent parts
focus on their comparative advantages in delivering both public and private goods and program
innovation through a mix of instruments and funding. Cooperation will focus on:
The financial sector: The joint framework includes increasing access to financial services,
furthering regulatory reform, and developing capital and local securities markets (including ongoing
ESMID efforts), with a goal of supporting key economic and social development needs, including
infrastructure and housing development, and investments for pension and insurance funds. In
addition to addressing the cross-cutting issues, specific operations will provide access to finance to
SMEs, energy, and bond market transactions, including an IFC local currency bond.
Business and investment climate: IDA and IFC, including through FIAS, will continue to deepen
support in these areas, particularly relating to sub-national doing business, trade logistics and tax
management.
Infrastructure: IFC interventions will complement ongoing IDA operations, and PPIAF will
increase its role in improving PPPs in infrastructure. Priority sectors will include road transportation
(completing transactions in the sector and procuring and implementing PPS within the existing legal
framework) and the electricity sector (working with sector institutions to expand geothermal
generation as well as transmission). Significant improvements in program delivery as well as better
allocation of risks and division of labor between public and private sectors will contribute to overall
program effectiveness.
Health: The focus will be on improving the enabling environment and creating opportunities for
private-public partnerships in health care provision, as part of the broader Health in Africa Initiative
(HAI), which provides integrated investment and advisory services to support private health
institutions and governments interested in leveraging the private sector to achieve national health
goals. An Equity Vehicle for Health in Africa, which is being managed by Aureos Capital, was
recently launched to increase access to equity finance for health businesses. Kenya is one of the
priority countries for the investments by the US$57 million fund.
In education: IFC will continue to work in the education sector, alongside IDA. It will support the
development of student loan schemes, as well as invest in the private secondary education sector.
IFC would enter into individual risk participation agreements with banks in respect of portfolios of
education loans, to provide much needed support to schools serving low and middle-income
populations which, due to their relatively small funding needs, IFC cannot reach through its direct
lending instruments.
Agribusiness: IFC will scale up its agribusiness operations (including food processing and
distribution), complementing IDA’s efforts to increase domestic food production. IFC is developing
new approaches, including wholesaling through banks with financial markets, to help extend its reach
to smaller producers, and support short term finance extended by commercial banks, and it is
contemplating development of a Global Food Fund to address short- and medium-term constraints in
the global food-supply chain.

□ MIGA will also continue to offer its guarantee products. During the CPS period, MIGA will
initially focus on public-private partnerships infrastructure such as the Nairobi toll road
project; several energy generation and distribution projects in cooperation with KPLC and
KenGen; and the restructuring of the Kenya/Uganda railway that links Kampala to Mombasa.

Annex 12: Country Financing Parameters
Date: December 21, 2007
The country financing parameters for Kenya set out below have been approved by the Regional Vice
President for Africa and will be posted on the Bank's internal website.
Item

Parameter

Remarks/Explanation

Cost Sharing
Limit on the proportion of
individual project costs that the
Bank may finance.

Up to 100
percent

Recurrent Cost Financing
Any limits that would apply to
the overall amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may
finance.

No countrylevel
limit.

Local Cost Financing

Yes

The Bank may finance up to 100 percent of the
costs of individual projects, but will only do so after
considering the context of these operations, the
extent to which counterpart finds are available, and
the implications for the overall portfolio. In
general, Bank financing is expected to be below 100
percent, especially in sector wide approaches
(SWAps). More specifically, the Bank could
finance up to 100 percent for social sector projects.
The Bank may also finance up to 100 percent of
project costs where no other sources of financing
are readily available. The Bank may also finance
100 percent of projects aimed at policy reform and
capacity building.
The Bank will continue to monitor the overall fiscal
situation, and the Government's continued
demonstration of commitment to sound fiscal
management, and its implications for recurrent cost
financing. In determining Bank financing of
recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank will
take into account sustainability issues at the sector
and project levels, including demonstration of the
temporary nature of financing needs; and the
Government's ability to sustain recurrent costs once
Bank financing is complete.
Kenya meets the two requirements for local cost
financing. The Bank may therefore finance local
costs in the proportions needed in individual
projects.

Are the requirements for Bank
financing of local expenditures
met, namely that: (a) financing
requirements for the country's
development program would
exceed the public sector's own
resources (for example, from
taxation and other revenues)
and expected domestic
borrowing; and (b) the
financing of foreign
expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing of individual projects
Taxes and Duties
Are there any taxes and duties
that the Bank would not
finance?

None

The Bank considers taxes and duties do not
constitute an excessively high share of project costs.
If Kenya's tax and customs regime changes
significantly during project implementation, this
parameter will be reviewed and revised as needed.

Annex 15: FY09-10 Client Survey/CPS Multi-Stakeholder Consultations
1.
Background. A Client Survey was conducted in September 2009, which was timed to
provide some initial client perceptions prior to the face-to-face stakeholder consultations on the
CPS. The survey was designed to assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of
how stakeholders in Kenya view the Bank, as well as use the data to inform the CPS
consultations process that the Country Team was about to embark on. The survey asked about:
overall attitudes towards the Bank; the importance of specific areas of the Bank’s work and the
Bank’s effectiveness in those areas; the respondents’ level of agreement with the way the World
Bank does business; general issues facing Kenya; and the Bank’s communication and outreach
efforts in Kenya.
2.
Process. A wide sample of stakeholders of the World Bank in Kenya was invited,
through mailed questionnaires, to provide their opinions of the Bank’s assistance to their
country. Participants in the survey were drawn from among national government officials or
staff, local government officials or staff, members of Parliament or staff, government-owned
corporations or financial institutions, agencies implementing Bank-supported projects, bilateral
and multilateral development agencies, private sector organizations or businesses, civil society
organizations, the media, and members of academe or research institutes. A total of 250
stakeholders participated in the Client Survey (25 percent response rate), mostly from the
Government. The analysis of the results was conducted by the World Bank team at headquarters
which supports client surveys globally.
3.
Results. The FY09 Client Survey results in Kenya indicate that overall: (i) the Bank
was well regarded in Kenya; the Bank’s work in the country was valued; and that stakeholders
were eager for the Bank to be involved in the most critical development challenges facing the
country. The Bank was assessed as being relevant, obtaining results and working in close
relationship with other partners to align its program, aligning its work with stakeholders’
development priorities and for its work on poverty. The Bank was valued mostly for its work on
poverty. The Bank was considered responsive and collaborative with other donors.
4.
Areas of Focus. In terms of areas of focus, the stakeholders ranked poverty and
corruption as the two most critical development priorities in Kenya. Stakeholders clearly
recognized the linkages between corruption and poverty. In their view, corruption and jobs
emerged at the top of the list of interventions that would contribute most to poverty reduction.
The results of the Client Survey demonstrated that the Bank has a clear role to play through
knowledge, research in supporting efforts to reduce corruption and poverty.
5.
Value to the Client. The Bank is most valued for providing resources to finance
development projects. The Bank’s knowledge is highly valued but more needs to be done to
disseminate to a wide range of stakeholders. The Bank’s greatest weakness is a lack of
understanding of the political economy context in which it has to operate and its bureaucratic
way of conducting business that leads to many delays. The Bank’s inability to communicate its
decisions on the program to the Client was also noted as an important area of weakness.

63

CPS Formulation and Consultation Process
6.
The CPS process was launched in Nairobi through a retreat of the members of the
Country Team who formed the CPS Core Team in April 2009. The discussions on the CPS went
through various stages of brainstorming, debating, working group discussions, government and
external consultations and internal reviews. A CPS leadership team and core team served as the
focal point for the work, which at times, involved a larger selection of the Country Team.
7.
Following is a summary of the key milestones throughout the 10 month CPS consultation
and formulation process. In addition to the key activities mentioned below, several meetings
were held in Nairobi in September, November 2009 and January 2010. External consultations
were carried out on a bilateral basis with development partners and other stakeholders, as well as
internal consultations on the results matrix through virtual meetings. These are not captured
below.

8.
The multi-stakeholder consultations were the main instrument for early consultations
about the key challenges and possible CPS themes. Building on the experience in the past CPS
period and on its regular outreach and dialogue activities, the Bank Group organized multistakeholder consultation workshops across the country in September, November 2009 and
January 2010. These workshops involved national and local governments, civil society, the
business community/private sector, academia, labor groups, human rights organizations, think
tanks, youth groups and other development partners.
9.
Discussions were guided by focus questions intended at drawing participants’ views,
observations and feedback regarding the previous CAS. Feedback was also sought with regard to
their opinion of the tentatively proposed three strategic themes of the next CPS 2010 – 2013
below:
i.
ii.
iii.

Unleashing Kenya’s growth potential;
Reducing poverty, inequality and social exclusion; and
Managing resource constraints and environmental challenges.

Background
10.
Process. Three separate consultations were organized with Nairobi-based NGOs,
academia, think tanks, civil society, private sector and other development partners.
Consultations were held with local government representatives, local NGOs, local business
community in Garissa (Northeastern Kenya) and Kisumu (Nyanza Province).
11.
The consultations provided a venue for a meaningful exchange of views with government
and various stakeholders on the critical development challenges as well as policy options and
programs that would address these challenges. They also helped increase government’s and
stakeholders’ understanding of the Bank’s work in Kenya. Questions were discussed with the full
group of participants and referred to the political economy environment, the causes of worsening
poverty, the adequacy of the proposed strategic themes for Kenya’s development challenges and
the impact of a weak governance environment. A consultant organization facilitated the
workshop, and key staff from the World Bank participated in the discussions.
12.
Results. The issue of governance surfaced throughout all three consultations. In the
discussion on poverty, two causes were identified: bad governance, and lack of livelihood and
employment opportunities. In the discussion of the failure to deliver public services, impact of
65

the 2007 post election crisis, food insecurity due to the maize scandal, corruption, and weak
citizen participation. A wide range of solutions were recommended, including electoral reforms,
strengthening local governments, streamlining the bureaucracy, decentralization and better
mechanisms to monitor community development funds (CDF), and increased investment in
human capital. The priority areas recommended for the new CPS were along the same theme of
governance: electoral reforms, transparency, and improving local governance. Also identified as
priority areas were education, health, and social protection. The Bank, the participants said,
should not engage in any form of political intervention.
Summary of Stakeholders’ Views
Perception of the Bank:
13.
The perception of the Bank among the ordinary Kenyan worker is still that of a
patronizing entity with a tendency for conditional lending.
Results/Impact: Perspective from Stakeholders under key themes.
 Stimulation of regular consultations between Government and private sector.
There has been progress in formal consultations between the Government and the private
sector. The quarterly Prime Minister’s Roundtable and the related ministerial
stakeholders’ forums as well the Speaker’s forum and the envisaged forum with the
Judiciary were singled out as critical avenues that have recently emerged as a result of the
Bank’s emphasis on accountability in governance and resource utilization.
 Success of Free Primary Education. The Bank’s support of free primary education
(FPE), particularly provision of an effective mechanism for tracking expenditure and
reducing avenues for corruption has had a strong positive impact. In addition to
enhancing accountability, it had resulted in better technical capacity in financial
management at school level by requiring schools to publicly display breakdowns of how
FPE funds are utilized.
 Support of energy has had positive multiplier effect. In the energy sector, the planned
expansion of the OlKaria Geothermal project is a critical catalyst for boosting private
sector production. Emphasis on geothermal power as opposed to hydropower is
responsive to the country’s urgent need to expand its supply of clean energy while
moving away from the current over-reliance of hydro-power, which has resulted in
frequent power rationing, disrupting economic activity.
 Infrastructure development has spurred growth. Ongoing support for infrastructure
including the transformation of the Mombasa Port into a 24-hour Port and the
rehabilitation of the Northern Transport Corridor are having a huge positive potential to
boost not only Kenya’s but also regional economies particularly in the Great Lakes
region.
 Support for water sector has boosted efficiency. Technical support to the water sector
has provided a framework for managing the entire water resource management and
provision. It has also improved efficiency in management of water as a utility service.
 Gains are evident in health sector. In health, support through the ongoing Total War
Against Aids (TOWA) has provided resources to grassroots organizations.

66

Challenges and opportunities
14.

Political uncertainty

Post-election violence, uncertain politics, a deteriorating environment and the prevailing
drought that has led to a huge threat of famine constitute challenges for the Bank’s work in
Kenya.
 Labor standards slacken as rural electrification escalates demand. In the labor sector
the ongoing rural electrification is bringing about tangible benefits in the improvement of
livelihoods around the country, the need to decentralize has resulted in engagement of a
multiplicity of contractors some of whose hiring practices are not up to acceptable
standards. As a result, there have been instances of exploitation of the Kenyan worker
that the Bank needs to be conscious about within its projects.
 Closer monitoring and evaluation could enhance impact of anti-poverty work. After
more than 40 years of lending, poverty levels in Kenya have remained stubbornly high
raising questions as to the effectiveness of the Bank’s monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms.
 Focus on materials could strain schools and teachers implementing Free Primary
Education. The Bank’s emphasis on provision of learning materials and technical
support for financial accountability has not kept pace with the need to focus on issues of
staffing, therefore leading to situations of over burdened teachers in many public schools.
This could compromise quality and undermine the aspirations of achieving FPE.
 Private sector seeks better structured consultations around laws and policies
Though the institutionalization of a consultative approach at the Prime Ministers’ Office,
ministerial, legislative and judicial levels had achieved marked success, there is still room
to create additional avenues for the involvement of the private sector towards influencing
laws and policies that would favor the business community.
 Governance/Civil Society. Consultation with actors in the Governance and Civil society
Sector took place between September 2009 and January 2010. Represented institutions
included universities, human rights organizations, the media, NGOs and faith-based
organizations. The focus was on the impact of the World Bank’s work on governance
from their respective perspectives.
 Fragile coalition. At the outset, it was noted that the consultations were taking place
against a backdrop of national fragility occasioned by the post-election violence.
Additionally, the resulting coalition government appears indecisive in its fight against
corruption, tackling the sensitive issue of regional imbalances, uncoordinated
management of devolved funds and a slow pace of reforms, particularly regarding
Agenda 4 of the national accord. Yet, the Government in its Medium Term Plan and in
Vision 2030 is targeting to reduce social exclusion generally and poverty levels from 46
percent in 2006 to 28 percent in 2012.
15.
Perception of the Bank: the Bank was perceived by this group of stakeholders as being
over reliant on the “technocratic approach” as opposed to policy support and institutional
strengthening. Yet, in Kenya, reforms tend to be anchored on incumbent individuals as opposed
to being anchored in policy and institutions, leading to a situation where exit of individuals often
leads to the abandoning of desirable initiatives that they were spearheading.
67

16.

17.

It was also observed that the Bank:


Is apparently struggling with its own governance issues in terms of representation of
developing countries on its Board of Directors.



Appears to be supporting too many reforms in a country whose capacity to successfully
complete required reforms may be overstretched.



Might not be taking a holistic approach in its support of certain sectors. In energy for
example, it was observed that though support of generation and distribution is very
timely, the cost of energy has gone up hence compromising gains achieved in poverty
reduction projects supported by the Bank.



There appears to be lack of consensus about what social exclusion means.
Results/Impact:

 The Bank can better harness its strong capacity for research and analysis.
The Bank’s strong capacity in research and analysis which it has integrated into it
projects has resulted in more efficient use of available resources.
 The community driven approach is bearing fruit. Innovative and successful
approaches in the Bank’s work have achieved the desired impact. Notable is the emphasis
on community-driven development as demonstrated in the Western Kenya Community
Driven Development and Flood Mitigation Project (Western Kenya CDD and FMP), the
Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP) and work to support development
of community foundations.
 The Bank’s approach has stimulated some level of positive institutional reform
The Bank’s emphasis on accountability has led to some progress in efficient delivery of
resources and services. It has resulted in some level of desired institutional reforms.
18.

Challenges and opportunities
 The Bank is limited on extent to which it can influence the political realm. Fragility
of the country itself constitutes a challenge to the Bank but the Bank is limited by its
mandate not to engage in the political sphere and is encouraged not to interfere.
Coordination of activities with bilaterals who face no such constraints is one way to keep
some programs moving when the political environment poses a constraint to Bank
activities.
 The Bank can bring its global experience to bear in delivery of devolved funds.
Despite the apparent poor coordination of devolved funds such as the Constituency
Development Fund and the Kazi Kwa Vijana (Work for Youth) initiative, the Bank,
because of its experiences in supporting the delivery of similar initiatives elsewhere can
provide information and learning that can help inform the improved delivery of these
initiatives. In effect, such initiatives would have higher chances of bringing about the
desired impact towards combating youth unemployment and its associated repercussions
such as rising insecurity (both urban and rural) and other social ills.

68

 The Bank can utilize civil society networks more in order to extend its reach
Stakeholders noted that civil society, including faith-based organizations such as the
National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), has vast infrastructure that can be used
to reach out to and support the youth. The Bank can explore how it can better partner
with civil society and churches to provide information and other forms of empowerment
to young people.
 Innovative ways of using the media to support youth programming are needed
A notable challenge was the observation that the power of the media has not been used
well enough to empower young people. Young people have unique ways of accessing and
utilizing information. For example, support for televised sports can be one such avenue
because experience has shown that media that transmit popular sports such as the English
Premier League (including communally supported subscription to Satellite pay TV in
rural and urban informal settlements) provide forums through which young people can be
engaged.
 Dearth of accurate data for more focused interventions to support youth. Another
key challenge regarding youth programming has been the dearth of data to determine the
scale of the problem of unemployed and unskilled young people. Rough figures show that
more than 300,000 young people fail to proceed to secondary schools. In four years, this
translates to more than 1.2 million young people who are virtually unemployable. At the
same time, the needs of young people living in different parts of the country are not
similar. Without this information, it is difficult to plan effective interventions. An
opportunity for the Bank might be supporting development research, possibly through
universities, as means of collecting accurate data regarding the status of youth
unemployment and attrition as a basis for formulating effective interventions.
Donors/Development Partners
19.
Consultations with donors represented in Kenya were held in between September 2009
and January 2010 at the Bank’s Nairobi office. All of them expressed their appreciation of the
Bank’s “new” consultative approach, which they urged the Bank to institutionalize. Among the
donors represented were the European Union, the Canadian International Development Agency,
the Netherlands Embassy, Embassy of Finland, USAID, DFID, AfDB, Embassy of Norway,
Embassy of Italy, Embassy of Germany, and UNDP.
Perception
20.
The donors perceive the Bank as having a higher capacity for research and analysis than
the rest of them. They also think it has a higher convening power and more clout than other
donors.
Results/Impact- as perceived
21.
The Bank’s participation in health and education, particularly through injection of
mechanisms for increasing accountability for funding has had a tremendous positive impact.

69

The Bank’s support of infrastructure development: The Port, Roads and in energy (Olkaria
Geothermal Project and the planned second water dam) has made wideranging positive impact in
boosting the country’s capacity for growth.
The Bank is crowding out donors in some sectors (health, education) given the large portfolio.
The Bank should focus its activities where other donors do not have a comparative advantage,
e.g. infrastructure.
Challenges and opportunities
22.
Given the Bank’s superior capacity for research and analysis, the Bank has the
opportunity to share information with other donors in order to help them leverage resources
available to Kenya and ensure that the competitive advantage of each donor is harnessed.
Case Study of Kitui District
Nzambani Water Project
The Project is a partnership between ALRMP and Nzambani
Secondary School. It was completed in 2007 and is located
in Kyanika Sub-Location, Nzambani Location, Chuluni
Division in Mutitu Constituency.
It entailed the
rehabilitation of borehole and the construction of a pipeline
to enable water to be pumped to an elevated reservoir. The
water then flows to two water kiosks located within a radius
of 5 km from the school. The World Bank’s investment was
Ksh 2,835,031.50 (about US$40,000) and the local
community has contributed an estimated Ksh. 759,000.00
(about US$10,120).
Impact: The project serves 1,000 households (6,000 people)
including two secondary schools with 440 pupils. During
drought, it serves 1,500 households totaling 9,000 people.
The mean score for Nzambani Secondary School in national
examinations has gone up and water borne diseases in the
community have gone down.
Kyambezi Shallow Well
The project was completed in 2006 and is located in
Kyanika Sub-Location, Chuluni Sub-location in Mutito
Constituency. Its objectives are two-fold: to improve
availability and access to water for domestic and livestock
use and; growing vegetables and raising forest seedlings.
The World Bank’s contribution was Ksh. 105,600 (about
US$1,400) while the community’s contribution was
estimated at Ksh. 100,000 about US$1,300).
Impact: the project supports approximately 50 households
(300 people) and has reduced the distance of drawing water
from 5 km to 1 km. The water is used domestically, for
growing vegetables and raising seedlings.
The above projects provided a snapshot impression of the
impact of the World Bank-supported Arid Lands Resource
Management Project (ALRMP) whose impact in Kitui was
evidently very high.

70

23.
The issue of preservation of
water catchment and expansion of the
forest cover has proved to be
particularly fraught with constraints
for all actors. Given its well
acknowledged convening power,
there is an opportunity for the Bank
to help facilitate a joint process to
conserve not only the Mau but other
water catchment areas around the
country.
Implications of the Stakeholders
Feedback for the World Bank
24.
Aligning the new CPS with a
supportive external communication
strategy. The Bank should make a
more proactive effort to change the
old perception of it as being too
strongly bent on giving conditional
lending to countries. This perception,
which dates back to the 1980s when
the Bank advocated structural
adjustment in developing countries to
make them more competitive, is not
relevant today and is an inaccurate
description of the Bank’s current
work in these countries. However, to
change that perception, it is important
that
the
Bank
adopt
a
communications
strategy
that
emphasizes outreach and sustained

external communication of the Bank’s approach of consultative engagement in defining a
program for a particular country. As such, the new CPS for Kenya can benefit from a supportive
communication strategy in order to enhance the public’s appreciation of the Bank’s work and the
unique circumstances under which it engages with countries.
Harnessing the Bank’s clout/convening power

25.
All the stakeholders, including importantly other donors, are in agreement that the Bank
has exceptional clout and convening power that the others on their own cannot master. This is a
feature that presents a huge opportunity for the Bank as it prepares the next CPS.
26.
More specifically, donors feel that the Bank needs to have a clear strategy for engaging
with other donors which could be built into the next CPS in order to ensure that donors leverage
each other and that their respective competitive advantages get harnessed.
Research and analysis
27.
The Bank’s documented record of accomplishment and emphasis in research and analysis
(the three As) was roundly acknowledged by all the stakeholders as a critical tool for leveraging
available resources so that all the actors: the Government, donors, private sector, civil society
and even the media can take more informed decisions with regard to development decisions.
Signaling
28.
Related to the capacity for research and analysis is the ability to signal other actors on the
best areas of development to which resources ought to be directed at any given time. The Bank
can also help signal or raise “red flags” whenever it encounters evidence of financial
malpractices and corruption.
Opportunity for more holistic support of auxiliary institutions
29.
The support offered by the World Bank to make the Port of Mombasa a 24-hour Port is
getting undermined by the fact that other auxiliary support services such as security and banking
services are not themselves in the 24-hour frame of operation.
30.
This could be an opportunity for the Bank to explore ways of strengthening these services
in order to enhance the pace of doing business at the Port. It would be a good opportunity for the
Bank to familiarize itself with institutions that could be impediments to its efforts in this regard
and explore how they can be appropriately supported.
The Bank can explore work with civil society actors with regard to youth programming
31.
Civil society, academicians and other actors in the governance sector expressed a strong
view that the World Bank’s interest in supporting youth programming could be better advanced
by the use of existing civil society networks, including those belonging to faith-based
organizations such the NCCK.
71

32.
These efforts would supplement work that is already being done with other actors such as
the Ministry of Youth Affairs.
Global experience and local presence
33.
The Bank has a unique opportunity as a multilateral donor, to bring its vast global
experiences to bear towards resolving local challenges.
The need to build capacity of Parliament
34.
Feedback from the private sector indicated that there is an opportunity for the World
Bank to support Parliament, possibly through training of MPs on how to analyze bills that come
before them in order to ensure quality debate before laws are enacted and that new laws are
supportive of efficiency in the business environment. The Bank could exert positive influence on
Parliament by providing TA to support these activities.
Support of social research
35.
The Bank can support research possibly through universities aimed at generating data
regarding the extent of youth unemployment, attrition from the educational system and other
impediments to youth participation in development. This data would then inform interventions
aimed at supporting young people who constitute more than 60 percent of the Kenyan
population.
36.
In the same vein, research can be supported to explore how the media, including new
media such as mobile phones, the internet and satellite TV could be better used to reach out to
young people and women as distinct groups and to give them voice.
Second Round - World Bank CPS Consultations – January 2010
37.
Additional consultations were carried out with the following groups: Donors, media,
Nyanza Economic Forum, Private Sector, Think Tanks and Academics, Youth Groups, Civil
Society, Faith-Based Organizations and Women Leaders.
Results
38.
All the groups placed governance, accountability and transparency at the top of their lists.
They also saw the connection between food insecurity and leakages in maize marketing. They
observed that the Bank has a comparative advantage to help in reforming the sector to limit
opportunities for corruption. Some of the groups (faith-based organizations) want the Bank to be
more involved in shaping policies that will help Kenya meet the challenge of a growing
population with one million youth expected to enter the labor force every year with few relevant
skills. There is a need to place greater emphasis on practical training and better education to
equip the youth to be competitive for the labor market. The KKV, a government-sponsored
program set up to provide jobs to the youth needs to be redesigned and the Bank can help. Some
noted that ethnic politics is at the heart of the lack of governance in Kenya and is partly
72

responsible for the unbridled population growth in the country. Ensuring greater accountability
and governance requires better public financial management. A summary of the issues raised by
each group is summarized below:
Civil Society
39.
Ensure strong links Ensure strong links between the MDGs (particularly those that are off
track) and the Bank program;
- Support institutions that are demanding accountability from political parties, including
following up on their manifestos;
- Support green energy;
- Ensure greater governance and transparency;
- Understand risks of ongoing reforms (constitutional reforms) and take step to mitigate
these;
- Help push for reforms of the National Cereals Marketing Board to ensure greater food
security and reduce leakages in maize marketing; and
- Improve the functioning of CDF funds (CDF, Kazi Kwa Vijana).
40.
Womens’ Groups want to see direct involvement of beneficiaries in projects and asks
that the Bank better focus its programs and study results prior to moving on to the next project,
e.g. if engaged in slum upgrading, complete the project, evaluate the results prior to designing a
follow-up operation; set standards for road building, i.e. use international procurement standards
to control costs; focus on strengthening accountability mechanisms; review relevance of
education – there are too many school leavers who are unemployed because they do not have the
skills set in demand by the private sector; focus in delivering higher levels of investments to the
arid and semi-arid lands that make up 85 percent of Kenya’s land mass. The Bank is not
sufficiently active in those regions and does not sufficiently contribute to poverty reduction and
reducing inequalities at the regional level.
Faith-Based Organizations
41.
The discussion centered around population growth and its impact on the future prospects
of Kenya, young people and their need for jobs, an education system that yields a high dropout
rates with drop outs not having access to more practical training that would prepare them for the
labor market. This fuels high rates of criminality among the youth. Core infrastructure is
perceived as key to job creation and growth and the Bank’s role is critical in mobilizing the
financial resources needed to fund such a large investment program. The Bank needs to demand
greater accountability from the Government for the financial resources it receives.
Private Sector/Think Tanks
42.
The Bank needs to find approaches that will yield better results in strengthening public
financial management. Kenya needs to move ahead on business regulatory reforms and not slide
backwards as it has been doing. In agriculture, it is important to shift emphasis from production
to marketing given the critical importance of the value chain. Finding a way to encourage
private sector investment in infrastructure is important but how to assign risks is an issue.
73

Agriculture and SMEs are key to poverty reduction. It is important that the Bank ensures that
gains made in macroeconomic management in the 80s/90s are not reversed. On infrastructure,
Kenyans may not be willing to pay for a toll road. The Bank needs to better understand the
political dimensions of the projects it finances.

Annex 16: Kenya CAS Completion Report (FY04-09)
Date of CAS: May 19, 2004
Date of CAS Progress Report: February 16, 2007
Time covered by CAS CR: FY04-09
Executive Summary
1.
The CAS Completion Report covers the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) period
FY04-07 and the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) period FY07-09, which was aligned with the
Government of Kenya’s medium- and long-term development strategies. The program was built
along four basic themes: (i) strengthening public sector management and accountability; (ii)
reducing the cost of doing business; (iii) reducing vulnerability and strengthening communities;
and (iv) investing in people. Within each theme, the CAS aligned Bank support to the three
pillars of the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERSWEC),
i.e. economic growth, poverty reduction, and governance and identified outcomes to which Bank
assistance was designed to contribute.
2.
Overall, CAS achievement is regarded as moderately unsatisfactory, with 45 percent of
CAS outcomes achieved, 10 percent not achieved, and 45 percent partially achieved. The CAS
program was ambitious to begin with, originally with 50 CAS outcomes and 68 progress
indicators, aligned with an average of 14 active projects per year. Despite a large portfolio of
spanning all major sectors with average commitments of about US$860 million, the Bank
disbursed only about US$90 million – or 10 percent of the portfolio envelope – per year. Some
of the highest disbursing sectors, e.g. agriculture, transport, and health, only showed mixed
outcome achievements with the exception of education where most outcomes have been
achieved. Other sectors, e.g. water, finance and private sector, and energy, show satisfactory
outcomes despite relative low levels of disbursements.
3.
Project approval was subject to periodic interruptions associated with negative events in
the country, often governance issues not related to any Bank project, and the program was underdelivered in nearly every year. The largest fluctuations in planned lending resulted from three
development policy operations, which all reached relatively advanced stages of design but were
not delivered. Quality of the portfolio was relatively low with an average of about 3 problem
projects per year.
4.
The CAS CR has found three central lessons: (i) increased participation of both men and
women (on the local and constituent level) leads to better results; (ii) implementation of
programs must be comprehensive and multi-faceted in design and monitoring, and be resistant to
external interruptions; and (iii) increased involvement of the private sector can help to drive
development outcomes. Areas of improvement for the future include increased engagement with
stakeholders, better alignment of indicators, outcomes, and projects with CAS objectives, and
reinforced policy dialogue including greater flexibility to ensure a consistent lending program.
Box 6 provides a broad assessment of Bank and Government performance during the CAS/CAS
PR period.

Box 6: Bank and Government Performance during CAS Implementation
What did the Bank do well?






Sector Dialogue: In many sectors, the Bank has been able to build trusting relationships and improve
reporting mechanisms, which allowed it to lead comprehensive sector reforms. The Bank did not shy away
from solutions such as strengthening reform efforts and project administration based on country systems. The
Bank successfully managed to operationalize already advanced reform processes and managed to support
implementation prepared and assisted by others. The Bank provided timely analysis and real time feedback on
important government efforts.
Donor Coordination: The Bank has generally been able to enhance donor coordination by playing a lead role
in key sectors. The Bank engaged in various pooling arrangements with donors and successfully leveraged
donor financing on top of Bank resources. Project preparation and supervision were carried out in consultation
with co-financiers.
Bank Assistance: The Bank demonstrated some flexibility in addressing implementation bottlenecks and
carried out timely project restructurings when needed to enhance the impact of Bank assistance. The Bank
generally ensured thorough project preparation and supervision, which was facilitated by effective
decentralization of key technical staff.

What did the Bank not do well?


Overall portfolio performance was low and the Bank’s projects did not disburse on time. Disbursement
forecasts have generally been too optimistic and implementation often slower than expected. The Bank’s
standard processes, including the need for prior review of procurement decisions, contract price adjustments
and other contract changes are burdensome and cause significant delays. In some cases, Board approval was
obtained before completion of design studies and bidding documents.

What did the Government do well?





Reform Efforts: Government generally agreed on comprehensive reform efforts rather than piecemeal
approaches. It successfully advanced policy and institutional reforms with a very positive track record in some
sectors including in areas with modest external support.
Results Focus: Government in many sectors accomplished increased openness and results-orientation. It
introduced fundamental elements of results-based management and demonstrated its commitment to the rapid
results approach to improve outcomes in service delivery.
Partnerships: Government committed to donor arrangements to support its reform agenda.
Implementation:
Government increased financial management and procurement capacities at key
implementing agencies. It committed to coordination across ministries despite difficulties.

What did the Government not do well?


While reform efforts have been impressive, there has been a lack of consistency between sector policies. There
is still need to make sure there is no contradiction between the overall policy framework and individual sector
policies. Policy leadership at the top levels of government need to improve. Government expectations with
respect to development targets still need to be more realistic. While implementation capacity improved, some
project units were initially not familiar enough with Bank procurement processes causing slow implementation
and disbursement. However, project teams have become more experienced and coordination difficulties
between implementation agencies and Treasury are beginning to fade.

Introduction
5.
The Bank’s Board endorsed a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Kenya in June
2004 for the period FY04-07. A CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) of February 2007 had the dual
function of evaluating progress and also extending the CAS period until end FY08. A new CAS
was planned for June 2008, but it was delayed as the implementation of the country program
suffered delays due to the political crisis of late-2007/early-2008. However, project preparations
and implementation during FY09 did continue roughly in line with the CAS/CAS PR. This CAS
Completion Report (CAS CR) therefore covers FY04-09 which is referred to as the “review
period” throughout the document.
Overview
6.
This CAS CR assesses results along the lines of the CAS/CAS PR framework. Individual
CAS outcomes are assessed in the context of four themes and along three IP-ERS pillar. The
complete framework is presented in Annex 17 and summarized in Figure 9. The next section
will highlight government goals, CAS objectives, and IDA lending trends followed by and
assessment of overall results and lessons. This is followed by a more detailed assessment of
progress under each CAS outcome by theme and strategic long-term country outcome. The last
section discusses portfolio performance and delivery of the CAS/CAS PR program.
Government Goals
7.
In 2002, the Kenyan Government launched a five-year development plan, the Economic
Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS), followed by a complementary
Investment Program (IP-ERS) in March 2004. The IP-ERS centered on three interlinked pillars:
(i) accelerating sustained economic growth underpinned by a stable macro-economic
environment; (ii) enhancing equity and poverty reduction to improve the welfare of Kenyans;
and (iii) improving governance to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery
and to create an enabling environment for sustainable business growth and development. The
IP-ERS also contained a comprehensive results framework aligning priority programs with
Kenya’s longer-term development targets, including the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). In 2007, Government launched a long-term development plan, Vision 2030. Vision
2030 continues the ERS focus on economic, social and governance/political development. To
implement Vision 2030, Government prepared the first of a series of five year rolling Medium
Term Plans, covering 2008-12.
8.
In addition to their medium-term and long-term development plans, the Government
prepared the “Governance Strategy for Building a Prosperous Kenya” (GSPK) in 2006. The
GSPK introduced a new approach to tackling governance in Kenya by accepting two
fundamental lessons. First, refinements in legal drafting, anticorruption campaigns or new
commissions and committees do not achieve positive results unless they are backed by a broader
governance framework with broad participation by, and support from, the Kenyan public.
Second, in this broader framework, emphasis on the cross-cutting theme of transparency could
make significant progress in many dimensions of governance and anticorruption and may be
more consistent with prevailing political realities. In January 2007, the Government announced
a one-year Government Action Plan (GAP). GAP measures covered public sector management
reforms, increased transparency and accountability, access to information, reducing the cost of
doing business, and increased community participation.
77

Bank Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes (FY04-09)
9.
The 2004 CAS was closely aligned with the IP-ERS including a detailed results
framework with CAS outcomes that drew selectively from the IP-ERS. The CAS focused on
four basic “themes”: (i) strengthening public sector management and accountability, parastatal
reform, and monitoring and evaluation capacity; (ii) reducing the cost of doing business and
improving the investment climate, including support for restructuring the financial sector,
promoting private sector development, improving infrastructure, and reducing barriers to trade;
(iii) reducing vulnerability and strengthening communities, including support for increased
agricultural productivity and competitiveness, improved environmental management,
strengthened local governments, and reducing poverty in the poorest rural areas and urban slums;
and (iv) investing in people, including support for an improved understanding of poverty, the
health sector, the education sector, and the national fight against HIV/AIDS. Within each theme,
the CAS aligned Bank support to the three pillars of the IP-ERS, i.e. growth, poverty reduction
and governance.
10.
The Bank strategy was updated in the 2007 CAS PR and aligned with Vision 2030 and
the governance objectives as outlined in the Governance Strategy for Building a Prosperous
Kenya/Governance Action Plan (GSPK/GAP). The CAS objectives remained unchanged but
attention to equity and governance was significantly enhanced. Reflecting greater attention to
equity, the support program was aimed at targeting more directly the poorest people. Lending
was given a more geographic focus with analytic work providing the basis for activities to target
areas with reduced access to development resources. Regarding governance, emphasis was
placed on supporting a subset of shorter-term priority actions in the GAP while maintaining a
longer-term focus. Areas included government transparency, greater access to information, more
stakeholder involvement, improvements in public financial management, strengthening the
regulatory framework of parastatals, reducing the cost of doing business and improving
governance in various government programs. The CAS PR continued the results framework of
the CAS at the same time adjusting it to the new priorities and strengthening the use of
indicators. For example, the CAS PR introduced a range of targeted results on governance to be
in line with the GSPK/GAP. Some less relevant indicators were “retired”.

As Figure 4 highlights, the Kenya program has a tradition of stop and go based on
external factors, such as political development and governance issues, and their impact on the
delivery of the lending program. During the review period, the 2002 elections and democratic
transfer of power followed by a 2003 Consultative Group meeting led to relatively consistent
delivery and higher levels of lending, albeit still lower than during some previous years.
Delivery of the lending program reached a new low during 2006, when the Bank decided to put
new lending on hold following various corruption charges during previous years including the
2004 Anglo Leasing affair and the 2005 “Githongo Dossier” revealing the involvement of
government officials in the scandal. The Government of Kenya agreed to Bank’s regional and
country managements’ suggestion to request a Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) carried
out by the Bank’s independent Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) in early 2006, which
Box 7: The 2006 Detailed Implementation Review
In October 2005, the Africa Region management and the Kenya country unit agreed with the Kenya Ministry of Finance
to ask INT to carry out a Detailed Implementation Review of key Bank-financed projects. The DIR was discussed with
ministries in late-2005 and eventually launched in January 2006. The review came on the heels of a governance review of
three Bank projects issued by Deloitte and Touche in July 2005 and was considered one exercise in a broader effort to
launch a more intensive and rolling governance review of the Bank’s portfolio.
The review focused on four operations: (i) Free Primary Education Support Project (FPESP) including an assessment of
the fraud and corruption safeguards in its successor project, the Kenya Education Sector Support Program (KESSP); (ii)
Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project (KHADREP); (iii) Kenya Decentralized Reproductive Health and
HIV/AIDS Project (DARE); and (iv) Northern Corridor Transport Improvement Project (NCTIP).
A first draft of the DIR was issued by INT in July 2006 with a finalized report issued in August 2006. A redacted version
of the report was shared with the Government of Kenya in September 2006. The DIR findings under each project were as
follows:
 FPESP: A satisfactory level of accountability from the local communities to the national ministry contributed to
the proper use of funds under FPESP. Key elements were the transparent provision of comprehensive
information, the use of efficient systems for flow of funds and strong local accountability mechanisms.
 KESSP: Governance was found to be generally acceptable with strong risk mitigating measures, which allowed
IDA support to progress without further delay. However, fiduciary safeguards in KESSP could be strengthened.
 KHADREP: Irregularity indicators exhibited in the contracts related to internal procurement conducted by the
National AIDS Control Council (NACC) included fraud, corruption and collusion.
 DARE: Credible information and evidence of widespread corruption was found throughout the project that
implicated the Ministry of Health.
 NCTIP: Multiple indicators of collusion identified under the project suggest that collusion may have taken
place, but no evidence of collusion was found.
The Bank team prepared a management action plan in response to the DIR, highlighting several immediate and
intermediate actions to address the issues raised. In addition, the CAS PR’s focus on governance aimed to support
Government’s efforts to establish better risk management controls system-wide and at project level. Key achieved
governance actions include: (i) putting in place of effective risk mitigation measures under the new HIVD/AIDS project
(TOWA) including a complete restructuring and governance reform of the NACC; (ii) anticorruption strengthening at the
ministry of health including significant improvements in procurement and financial management; (iii) governance
improvements in the road sector, including setting up of three autonomous road agency to streamline ownership,
management, accountability, and financing of all road networks; (iv) in-depth review of procurement and financial
management arrangement in planned and ongoing operations; (v) external expert panel of sector specialists to provide
independent review on the quality of the Bank's governance and anti-corruption measures in recently prepared projects;
and (vi) engaging INT in project design.

79

found irregularities in some projects (see Box 7). The eruption of violence after the December
2007 elections resulted in another significant stop in the lending program with new lending on
hold until March 2009. Within the last months of FY2009, the Bank successfully managed to
defy this trend with record new lending of US$463 million, the highest level of new
commitments in 20 years.

While there has been great fluctuation in new commitments, there has also been a trend
of decreasing disbursements. As shown in Figure 5, the share of disbursements over
commitments declined steadily from 23 percent in the early 1990s to only 7 percent by the end of
the decade. In 2001, the year before the first multi-party elections, disbursements reached a
record high of 24 percent disbursements over commitments, only to decline to new record lows
after the new government was in place. Disbursement shares were in the single digits for three
out of six years during the review period.

In addition to an overall decrease in disbursement levels, the past decades saw a relative
shift in the sectors with the highest levels of disbursements. While the beginning of the 1990s
was dominated by the finance/private sector, economic policy, education and agriculture were
the more dominant sectors during the rest of the decade. Since 2004, there has been a shift to
infrastructure (transport and energy) and agriculture together with relative high levels of
disbursements in human development (health and education).

As shown in Figure 7, health and education were the highest disbursing sectors during the
beginning of the CAS period (FY04-07), with transport and agriculture leading disbursements
during the end of the CAS period and throughout the period of the CAS PR (FY07-09).
Agriculture has been the dominant sector in terms of level of disbursements throughout the entire
review period. The sector ranked among the top three disbursing sectors during each of the past
six years. Education and transport came in second both featuring among the top three disbursing
sectors for four out of six years.
Overall Results and Lessons Learned
15.
Overall achievement of CAS outcomes is regarded as moderately unsatisfactory. The
CAS identified 50 outcomes11, of which only 45 percent were achieved, 10 percent were not
achieved, and 45 percent were partially achieved. The CAS contribution to IP-ERS pillars and
themes is shown in Figure 9. The only CAS theme that achieved more than 50 percent of CAS
outcomes is Theme 2 (Reducing the Cost of Doing Business), and as such, is the only theme that
may be rated as satisfactory. All other themes should be rated unsatisfactory since less than
half of their outcomes were achieved. Theme 4 (Investing in People) has the second highest
percentage of outcomes achieved and a relatively high percentage of partially achieved
outcomes, due to strong results in the education sector and mixed results in the health sector;
Theme 1 (Strengthening Public Sector Management and Accountability) shows the highest
percentage of partially achieved CAS outcomes due to moderate results in public sector
governance, but also has the lowest percentage of achieved outcomes; and Theme 3 (Reducing
Vulnerabilities and Strengthening Communities) shows the highest percentage of outcomes not
achieved due to mixed performance in the agriculture sector.
16.
Regarding IP-ERS Pillars, Pillar 3 (Governance), has the highest percentage of outcomes
achieved at 50 percent, and only six percent of the outcomes were not achieved. Pillar 2
(Poverty Reduction) has the second highest percentage of outcomes achieved, but also has the
highest percentage of outcomes not achieved at 18 percent. Pillar 1 (Economic Growth) has only
40 percent of outcomes were achieved, but has the highest percentage of partially achieved
outcomes.

To facilitate this analysis some outcomes were merged to reach a total of 42 CAS outcomes.

As Figure 8 demonstrates, there is no necessary correlation between high levels of
disbursements and outcome achievements on the sector level. Agriculture has the highest level
of disbursements over the review period with 30 percent of the total share. However, the sector
only achieved under half of its outcomes, with another third remaining not achieved (the highest
of all sectors). Transport and education are the next two highest disbursing sectors, both equally
disbursing 21 percent. While the transport sector had mixed performance and only achieved one
quarter of its outcomes (one of the lowest of all sectors) with the remainder of outcomes partially
achieved (the highest of all sectors), the education sector showed strong performance and
managed to achieve over two thirds of its outcomes without any outcomes not achieved. Health,
the fourth highest disbursing sector, showed poor results with 25 percent achieved outcomes (one
of the lowest of all sectors) and 25 percent outcomes not achieved (second highest of all the
sectors). The best performing sector is energy with only 5 percent of overall disbursements, but
80 percent of outcomes achieved and zero outcomes not achieved. Water also managed to
combine relatively low levels of disbursements of about 5 percent with a strong performance
achieving two thirds of sector outcomes with zero outcomes not achieved (same as in education).
The lowest overall disbursements are in finance/private sector, public sector and economic
policy – all sectors with a focus on policy dialogue and quality analytics rather than major capital
investments. These sectors all performed on similar levels with about 50 percent of outcomes
partially achieved.

Box 8: Output based aid under the Microfinance for Water Services Project
The FY07 CAS Progress Report profiled innovative programs aimed at improving access to
financing to be evaluated during the CAS period for impact, lessons learned, and scope and
modalities for scaling up. Through collaboration from Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid
(GPOBA) and other partners, Kenya piloted an output-based microfinance program for
community-managed water projects with the purpose of increasing sustainability and funding
predictability. The project aims at developing an alternative financing mechanism for water
supply and rural infrastructure to contribute towards the realization of the Millennium
Development Goals and the global agenda for poverty alleviation.
In the project, subsidies were given to approximately 21 Ceramic Water Purifier (CWPs) in
rural and peri-urban areas to increase access and efficiency of water supply services. Each CWP
sub-project is pre-financed through a combination of its own resources (20 percent) and a loan
from the K-Rep Bank, a local micro-finance bank. Upon successful completion of the project
and certification of the delivery of outputs by an independent auditor, a partial subsidy of 40
percent of total project cost is made to the CWP to repay a part of the loan from the K-Rep
Bank. K-Rep Bank has hired staff to closely monitor the implementation of sub-projects. It has
also negotiated discounts of 35 percent to 60 percent for bulk supply of materials for subsidized
sub-projects, helping to mitigate the construction cost increase.
The total cost of the project is US$2.15 million and is expected to reach about 60,000 people.
Disbursements have been made to 12 out of 21 water supply projects, reaching 34,000
beneficiaries. The project is currently being scaled up to target a total of 55 projects
(representing a total investment of US$5.6 million) with funds from the EU Water Facility. The
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) also provides capacity building support and overall
supervision of the project and the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) has
provided project development grants to communities wishing to apply for loans from K-Rep
bank.
OBA minimizes fiduciary risks by: (i) transferring the performance and operational risk to the
service provider, and (ii) paying the pre-agreed subsidy after the outputs have been
independently verified, providing assurance and evidence that funds have been used for the
intended purpose, and an incentive to the utility to perform efficiently and transparently. The
project demonstrates that microfinance has an innovative and beneficial role to play in
financing small water infrastructure in the country by recognizing that:
Increasing the sustainability of small community-managed water supply projects through
improved system efficiency, effective management, and improved accountability and good
governance.
It aims to develop a business product to be used to leverage entry into other rural infrastructure
sectors (e.g. electricity, private schools).
Expanding project outreach to provide further customer growth through financial products
linked to the project (e.g. agricultural inputs, housing improvements, etc.).

Based on a detailed review on CAS outcomes, the following lessons emerge:
Community participation not only helps to achieve results, it also provides strong
governance support and reduces the negative impact of national crisis on beneficiary
communities. In addition, taking proactive measures to address the priorities of both women
and men have further enhanced the relevance of the Bank’s programs. For example, during
the implementation of the Arid Lands Project, elite captures at the community level became
clear. Improved participatory methodologies were adopted to address this issue. Moreover,
the project's community orientation contributed to resolving inter-ethnic conflicts, increasing
voice and advocacy for the beneficiaries, and deepening national political awareness of the
extreme problems faced in the arid and semi arid regions of Kenya. Another experience is
evident in the water sector. In 2006, a range of locally based stakeholders launched a Citizen
Report Card (CRC) initiative in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu to assess citizens’
experiences with water supply, sanitation and solid waste services. The CRC drew attention
to problems, facilitated corrective action, promoted exchange of ideas and approaches, and
helped identify good practices. Finally, transfer of funds to schools supported improved
efficiency and ownership. Funds received by schools have been correctly recorded and
properly used. A large majority of the schools have put in place systems that ensure
transparency and value for money.
Strong constituencies helped secure good results in sensitive areas. For example,
important progress has been made in reducing private sector costs in the area of international
trade: the transit time from Mombasa to Kigali has gone from 19 days to nine. This is
strongly supported by the business community. In 2005 Kenya legalized the Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) which resulted in a drop of international phone traffic and some
reduction in international call prices. This eliminated telecommunications services as major
constraints faced by the private sector according to surveys.
Concerted actions by the international community do assist to find positive responses.
Therefore, joint actions could help advance the development agenda. For example, the
substantial improvement in the institutional performance of the National AIDS Control
Council (NACC) has been confirmed by evidence. This positive institutional impact was
partly due to the active Bank engagement and support working together with other donors.
Further dialogue to involve the private sector in large investment capital for
infrastructure should emphasize steps to improving the legal framework for
privatization and ensuring that the overall political, macro and business environment
are not perceived by the private sector as unduly high risk. This is crucial to advance
private participation in the energy sector, in ports operations, including container operations
at Mombasa and in the telecommunications sector.
Periodic interruptions in lending associated with negative events in the country, not
necessarily related to the project, delay implementation and prevent from achieving
CAS outcomes on time. This is the case even if projects are subsequently implemented with
some measure of success. There is a need to minimize such interruptions by reinforcing the
policy dialogue and by avoiding, to the extent possible, that specific events impact the whole
lending program. These interruptions explain, to a large extent, why so many outcomes have
been (only) partially achieved. The proposed Judicial Performance Improvement Project was
originally planned for FY07. It is now scheduled for FY09, a delay that negatively affected
the achievement of a CAS objective. Also, activities under the Northern Corridor project
were delayed and the Additional Financing covering cost increases had been planned for
FY08 but was not approved until the third quarter of FY09.
86



Monitoring and reporting on results indicators improved during the CAS period.
However, there is still the need to better align projects and CAS indicators and to
monitor all CAS outcomes. For example, there were no sufficient indicators to measure the
effectiveness of public spending. Similarly, in the Decentralized Reproductive Health and
HIV/AIDS Project no systematic monitoring of project indicators had taken place making it
difficult to assess progress.
Box 9: Highlights of CAS Outcomes by Theme

CAS Theme 1: Strengthening Public Sector Management and Accountability [Unsatisfactory]
 The fiscal framework has been improved; domestic borrowing and the fiscal deficit were
reduced. There is some evidence for improvements in the poverty effectiveness of public
spending.
 There is more access to information and some progress in disclosing court proceedings and
reducing backlog despite delay in Bank support. Notably, there was an improvement in
access to legal information on prior cases within 24 hours which potentially increases speed
and transparency of court proceedings.
 The regulatory frameworks for parastatals improved. There has been some progress on
privatization, but parastatals remain a fiscal burden.
CAS Theme 2: Reducing the Cost of Doing Business and Improving the Investment Climate
[Satisfactory]
 Financial intermediation deepened; credit provided to the private sector increased. Access to
financial services reached increased segments of the population. Regulatory and
institutional framework for the financial sector also improved, including setting up of key
regulations for microfinance, credit cooperatives, which benefit in particular lower segments
of the population.
 Regulatory and institutional frameworks for roads, energy and water have been
strengthened. Access to modern energy services increased, electricity became more reliable
and is being used by more customers. Water services in Nairobi are more reliable and less
costly and water security in water-scarce communities was enhanced. Travel time along the
Northern Corridor road reduced.
 Competition in the telecommunications markets was expanded and costs reduced making
telecommunications no longer a major obstacle for doing business. There has been a
reduction in the cost and time to start a business, to obtain construction permits and to
complete exports. As a result of government-wide licensing reforms supported by FIAS, the
investment climate advisory service of the World Bank Group, the burden imposed by
licenses on businesses has been reduced.
 There is evidence for some increase and sustainment of formal employment.
 There is evidence that women face more severe barriers to starting and running businesses
than do their male counterparts.
CAS Theme 3: Reducing Vulnerability and Strengthening Communities [Unsatisfactory]
 There has been slow progress on environmental management.
 An effective drought early warning and response system was put in place and capacity of
communities in drought affected districts was strengthened.
 An institutional framework and pilot activities for agriculture reach and extension was set
87

up. Agriculture market reforms were supported, but there is no clear impact on smallholder
incomes.
CAS Theme 4: Investing in People [Unsatisfactory]






Health indicators improved with decreases in child- and infant-mortality, although not
necessarily all through Bank support. However, there is evidence of high maternal mortality
which was badly affected by the post-election violence and institutional problems in the
health sector.
There has been progress in education achievements: increase in primary completion
(especially for girls), transition rates and some progress in the quality of education. Unlike
other sectors, outcomes in the education sector typically involve long gestation periods and
extended timetables for results.
The fight against AIDS is benefitting from better governance in implementing institutions
and overall prevalence fell during the review period.

Detailed Results
Theme I: Strengthening Public Sector Management and Accountability
Public Sector Management
CAS Outcome: Significantly reduce net domestic borrowing [Achieved]
19.
The country’s net stock of domestic debt was reduced from 21.4 percent of GDP in
2003/04 to 18.4 percent in 2006-07 meeting the Government’s fiscal and policy targets for net
domestic borrowing. Despite the global crisis, the net domestic borrowing would be limited to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2007-08. Therefore, the stock of domestic borrowing is unlikely to grow
as a percentage of GDP. Other indicators that the CAS aligned with this outcome were also
achieved. These include integration of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
process with the annual budget process, which, in turn, has resulted in improved alignment of the
MTEF with the IP-ERS as well as an increase in the share of the budget allocated for capital
expenditures. Development expenditures increased from 3 percent of GDP in 2003-04 to 4.4
percent in 2006-07. All these appear to have impacted positively the country’s longer-term goals
to which these outcomes were aligned, especially with respect to the goal of reduction in the
country’s fiscal deficit. In fact, the overall fiscal deficit has been reduced from 3.7 percent of
GDP in 2002-03 to 1.7 percent in 2006-07. However, the budget deficit did increase as a result
of the sharp increase in expenditures in 2007-08 to an estimated 4.8 percent of GDP for 2007-08,
still lower than originally thought for the year. The global crisis is likely to have impacted these
results.
20.
The Bank contributed significantly to improvements in Kenya’s fiscal framework through
technical assistance and innovative analytical support. The Institutional Reform Capacity
Building TA (FY06), among other things, focuses on strengthening public financial management
systems, strengthening oversight institutions and improving responsiveness to public expenditure
policy priorities. Core analyses became increasingly sophisticated and tailored to the country
environment. A Public Expenditure Review (FY04), focusing on strengthening the medium88

term perspective in budget-making, was followed by Bank participation in the Public
Expenditure Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA-FY06), which reviewed financial
management systems, processes and institutions. The Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
(FY06) provided a joint assessment of budgeting, public financial management and procurement
to improve expenditure management. There has also been strong support from the Financial and
Legal Sector TA (FY05) to strengthen the public debt management office at the Ministry of
Finance (now officially a unit), with major results thus far and others ongoing. This office has
benefitted as well from support from the World Bank Treasury in the context of the supervision
of this operation.
CAS Outcome: Improve poverty and growth effectiveness of public spending [Partially
Achieved]
21.
Since the introduction of the ERS in 2002, a major economic policy objective included
refocusing public spending from non-productive to productive purposes oriented toward growth
and poverty-reduction. Priority sectors include agriculture, infrastructure, health and education.
Spending in infrastructure as percentage of GDP increased significantly during the review period
followed by a minor increase in agriculture spending. Health and education spending on the
other hand decreased slightly. Combined spending on ERS priority sectors increased at the same
rate as total public expenditure in 2002-03 and 2006-07, remaining at about 58 percent. More
recent estimates are not yet available.
22.
The CAS indicator to measure progress under this outcome was for budget allocation to
“poverty targeted programs” not to fall below 4 percent of GDP. The CAS did not specify the
exact measure for this indicator but the concept of ‘core poverty programs’ (CPPs) introduced in
2002 aims at protecting poverty-friendly spending. Revised CPP criteria from 2003-04 seek to
cover pro-poor programs that increase incomes of the poor, improve their quality of life,
security, and promote equality. CPPs share of overall budget increased from 10 percent to 14
percent during 2003-07. The CAS did not include other specific monitoring indicators but the
less than desired transparency in the procurement process is bound to have affected the
effectiveness of public spending at central level (see below). However, a more positive picture
emerges in partial assessments. For example, reporting mechanism strengthened the quality of
expenditures in education. Transfer of funds to schools did improve efficiency and ownership.
According to an audit report, in most cases, funds received by schools have been correctly
recorded and used for intended purposes. A large majority of the schools have put in place
systems that ensure transparency and value for money.
23.
The Bank’s analytical work contributed positively to poverty-friendly and growth
effectiveness of public spending. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM; FY08) discussed
the allocation of fiscal resources to infrastructure and social spending in health and education.
The Poverty mapping exercise (FY06) combined census information with household survey data
to estimate poverty and inequality with detailed geographic precision. The Kenya Poverty and
Inequality Assessment (FY08) was originally planned for FY06 in anticipation of the 2005-06
Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and Participatory Poverty Assessment
(PPA). Over the period 2005 through 2008, the Bank together with DFID, USAID and GTZ
provided technical support to the data collection, compilation and analysis of KIHBS and PPA
by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. The official KIHBS and PPA final reports were
89

published in 2007, including the release of KIHBS micro-data for use by research and academic
institutions.
CAS Outcome: Improve transparency in budget reporting [Partially Achieved]
24.
Transparency in budget reporting remains a challenge but has improved over the period,
which was confirmed in the recent PEFA (October 2008). The assessment found a trend towards
better political involvement and openness of the budget. Key reforms to provide an enabling
environment were laid during the review period, including: (i) the 2003 Public Officers Acts,
which introduced a code of conduct and compulsory filing of annual declarations of assets and
income for public officers; (ii) the 2003 Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, which
established the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC); (iii) the 2005 Privatization Act,
which helps to increase accountability and transparency in the privatization of parastatals; (iv)
the 2006 Statistics Act, which established and independent statistics bureau. In addition, various
administrative reforms have been implemented including outlawing harambees (political fund
raising events), establishing the ministerial code of conduct, introducing performance contracts,
reforming tax administration and simplifying business licensing regimes.
25.
The key CAS indicator under this outcome was an improvement in ratings under the
Public Expenditure Management Assessment and Action Plan, which increased from meeting 3
to 6 out of 15 indicators in 2003-06. In addition, the CAS aimed for an introduction of the
Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) in at least two ministries and IFMIS has since
been introduced in all but two ministries. According to the 2008 PEFA, “the roll-out of the
system is a tremendous improvement in terms of data integration and access as compared to the
previous situation”. However, the payroll system (IPPD) is currently not integrated in IFMIS.12
Nevertheless, the IPPD provides most other data expected from a personnel database. The
payroll and personnel databases are regarded to be fully integrated in IPPD. A risk-based
internal audit approach, including establishment of ministerial audit committees, has been
adopted by all ministries. Internal and external payroll audits have been undertaken for several
ministries and entities, e.g. the Ministry of Health. The internal auditors have performed payroll
audits on the IPPD system. Errors and anomalies in the records relating to earlier omissions are
now easier to identify. Relevant information generated by the IPPD is used by the IFMIS and
could not otherwise been captured.
26.
Nevertheless, the civil service payroll contains some allowances including a weak link
between job performance and remuneration, which reduce transparency and effectiveness in
budget reporting. The lack of transparency will require more training and a thorough
management review, areas which call for strong political commitment. While all these factors
are observed, it must be acknowledged that some steps are being taken to improve the civil
service. Over the past four years, Kenya has introduced some of the key elements of a resultsbased management (RBM) system, such as Service Charters and Performance Contracts (PCs).
Kenya received a UN reward primarily for the implementation of PCs in the civil service (2007)
and a recent evaluation report, commissioned by the public sector reform donor group concluded
12

The IPPD is not integrated with IFMIS since it has a different and centralized database structure. The systems are
also built on different technical platforms: IPPD is a tailor-made system while IFMIS is an adjusted standard
package solution on an Oracle database structure. Payroll data is entered manually into IFMIS following printouts
from IPPD.

90

that progress had been made in moving towards a RBM system in the public service. These
reforms have initially largely focused on institutions, rather than civil servants, but the reforms
are clearly a prerequisite for a performance based remuneration system.
27.
Progress in key aspects of procurement transparency remains slow but important
institutional reforms, e.g. the new procurement legislation and the Public Procurement Oversight
Authority (PPOA) established in 2007 are in place. Over the past year PPOA has produced a
number of reports and reviews shedding light on procurement practices and that are posted on
the PPOA website. The new legislation and publications have enabled non-state actors to inform
themselves about public procurement, including a recent report from the National Taxpayers
Association on the use of CDF funds. Moreover, the PPOA working in cooperation with
stakeholders in the private sector at an advanced stage on the introduction of e-procurement. The
Banks has provided ICT support to this process. However, there remains limited progress in: (i)
increasing the share of pre-qualified companies doing business with Government; (ii) publishing
of information on government procurement contracts; and (iii) blacklisting of companies found
to be involved in corrupt practices.
CAS Outcome: Greater Access to Information [Partially Achieved]
28.
Some limited progress towards this outcome has been achieved. There is greater access to
information and an independent statistical system has been established. Partial progress had been
achieved in connection with the disclosure of court proceedings.
29.
The Transparency and Communications Infrastructure Project (FY07), a Kenya
component of a wider regional communications infrastructure program, contributed to an
increase in internet user penetration to 1.7 million with tele-density reaching about 12 million (or
35 percent of the population). However, no progress been made on electronic recording of
events originating with e-government applications. The modest target for 2012 is to process
100,000 applications. While the project contributes to building communications infrastructure
with an impact on overall access to information, it does not necessarily affect freedom of
information. In fact, the Statistics Act of 2006, while promoting some degree of transparency,
includes a controversial provision for censoring private opinion polls. Public access to
declarations of assets by public officials remains an unmet objective. The Financial and Legal
Sector TA Project (FY05) and the Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT, established under
the MSME Competitiveness project) have supported periodic surveys of financial services
(Finscope/FinAccess), first carried out in 2006 and recently updated in 2009. The Central Bank
has institutionalized these surveys as of 2008, which are now going to be part of its regular
reporting services. In addition to the latter, the Central Bank with initial FSDT support has been
reporting quarterly reports on bank charges and lending rates for each of the banks in the system
improving transparency, which arguably, would also helped lower interest rates through
increased transparency and competition amongst banks.
30.
Progress has taken place in disclosing proceedings in the High Court and Court of
Appeals. Disclosing these proceedings is important for setting jurisprudence in Kenya. The
proceedings are published on hard copy and on-line by the National Council of Law Reporting,
an independent agency affiliated with the Judiciary of Kenya. There has been no progress on
disclosing proceedings at the magistrate level although some work in that regard is being done.
While disclosing the High Court of Court of Appeals court proceedings is important for the legal
91

profession, disclosing magistrates’ proceedings is even more important for the “clients” of
judicial services (the public at large) since the majority of the cases are filed and resolved at the
magistrates court level. The majority of the citizens who do not go to appeal need to be informed
on judicial processing and adjudications. A Norwegian grant administered by the World Bank
was supposed to automate the recording of court proceedings thereby expedite the disclosure of
information, however it experienced implementation obstacles partly due to procurement
constraints and also due to the administrative arrangements of the grant. The Trust Fund has
since closed, but the related activities have been taken over by the FLSTAP.
31.
Very preliminary steps have been reported regarding the establishment of new courts
and/or the introduction of improved procedures to reduce the backlog of cases. There were one
million cases pending at the end of 2006. The World Bank provided support to two of the
judiciary's committees, the Expeditious Disposal of Cases Committee, and the Rules Committee.
The Rules Committee prepared draft rules and amendments to the Civil Procedure Rules have
been submitted to the Chief Justice for approval. These rules, once administratively approved by
the Chief Justice, will provide ways to expedite cases and timelines for resolving litigation.
Some minor amendments to the rules require a constitutional amendment and legislative reforms
(which are likely to create some complications). However, these amendments have been
submitted to the Attorney General for final review and submission to parliament for approval.
The proposed Judicial Performance Improvement Project (JPIP) currently under preparation will
continue with steps to reduce the backlog of cases. Reducing the backlog will also demand more
efficient process-management. The JPIP will forward this objective by fully implementing a
case management system, by providing training to judges and by carrying-out additional
programs to “clean” pending cases (some may have now expired due to the time elapsed).
Meanwhile, a pilot case is being developed to facilitate full implementation of the case
management system as part of the Financial and Legal Sector TA (FY05). Also, the Federation
of Women Lawyers Kenya (FIDA), with assistance from the World Bank, has promoted genderresponsive legal reforms and developed a self-representation manual on matters pertaining to
land, child custody, and alimony specifically targeted to women who have limited access to the
legal sector.
32.
Corruption in the judiciary does not appear to be as big a problem as once thought and
there are indications that the judiciary in Kenya is not perceived with the same contempt than
other national institutions. The stature that judges enjoy was implicitly acknowledged in the
appointment of the Supreme Court Justices to the Commission investigating the latest instance of
political and ethnic turmoil. However, the lack of resources does affect the quality of judicial
services which nevertheless seem to be in high public demand. Judicial decisions are not
overturned on appeal in large numbers, suggesting that the quality of the lower courts’ judicial
decisions is less arbitrary. On the other hand, people in the informal and rural sectors do not
always appreciate the intervention of judges in criminal cases because they tend to limit their
decisions to imposing penalties without awarding economic restitution, which is often at the core
of the demands. Additional guidance and training offered by the judicial training institute partly
set up with assistance judiciary resources, FLSTAP and the project preparation funds of the
proposed JPIP will remedy this situation.

CAS Outcome: Greater stakeholder involvement [Partially Achieved]
33.
Government has over the past year enabled a very inclusive budget process welcoming
comments from key stakeholders during regular budget hearings usually in March. New
legislation will change the time-table for the budget process (and the budget format) to allow for
more timely and effective parliament contribution.
34.
Despite some isolated efforts, no substantive progress can be reported regarding the
creation and use of community-level mechanisms and involvement in monitoring public
procurement. There were some important initiatives implemented while several other initiatives
by the Bank in association with other donors’ did not materialize. The Freedom of Information
legislation with whistle blower protection has not been enacted yet.
35.
Some initiatives for information sharing and feedback modalities have started in the
water sector with the “Citizen’s Report Card on Urban Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste
Services in Kenya”. They reinforced some success in the sector while facilitating policy
management. In 2006, a range of locally based stakeholders launched a Citizen Report Card
(CRC) initiative in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu to assess citizens’ experiences with water
supply, sanitation and solid waste services. The CRC draws attention to problems, facilitates
corrective action, promotes exchange of ideas and approaches, and helps identify good practices.
The Kenya Alliance of Residents Associations (KARA), a locally based organization,
coordinates this initiative on behalf of a wider, multi-stakeholder forum called the Nairobi City
Consortium.13 In Nairobi, corruption in provision of water services between those directly
connected to mains and utility staff was reported at only 5 percent in this survey. However, at
focus group discussions held before the survey, many participants reported that petty corruption
was occurring. Where payments are made by landlords, the possibility that bribery is occurring at
the interface between landlord and water company staff opens up. All these involvements, while
important, are restricted to the informative stage so far.
CAS Outcome: Improvement in Public Financial Management [Not Achieved]
36.
PFM improvement has been unsatisfactory during the CAS period since the main PFM
Reform program has stalled for the last four years, due to major implementation challenges
within government relating to the effectiveness of the PFM Reform secretariat and also due to
weak coordination and leadership on the part of donors. The National Audit Office (KENAO) is
operational as established within the Constitution and the Public Audit Act. The Office reports to
Parliament and is responsible for auditing all public sector entities, including Bank-funded
projects. Audit reports are current and published on the KENAO website. However, the impact
of these audits seems minimal. The audit for the year ended June 2006, for example, includes
details of inaccurate appropriations, unauthorized reallocation of funds, irregularities in
procurement, equipment being used for ineligible purposes and irregular disbursements of certain
funds. Due to a number of unexplained discrepancies, omissions of expenditures from the
accounts and lack of documentation to support some of the figures, the auditor was not able to
express an opinion on the financial statement. Something similar happened with the FY07 audit.
13

The survey reported high satisfaction with respect to: (i) water supply (67 percent); and (ii) availability and
cleanliness of public toilets (66 percent). Satisfaction was low with respect to (i) water kiosks (45 percent); (ii)
sewerage services (45 percent); (iii) rubbish collection services (30 percent).

93

While the information is posted on the Internet, it is unclear how much debate or action to
eradicate improper practices they actually prompt. Lack of action on these matters seems to
reinforce a sense of impunity.
37.
The CAS also called for implementation of government’s Business Licensing Report, a
program championed by Ministry of Finance and other center-of-government institutions, and
supported by FIAS, the investment climate advisory service of the World Bank Group (joint
WB-IFC). In 2006-07 the government launched an ambitious licensing reform program, which
quickly led to the elimination of 110 business licenses and the simplification of a further eight,
reducing the time and cost of obtaining building licenses, registering a company and obtaining
various general and sector licenses. Recent ongoing reforms (in late 2008) include the adoption
of laws simplifying the Single Business Permit imposed at the local authority level. At the end
of the multi-year program, it is anticipated that more than 600 of the existing 1,300 licenses will
be simplified or eliminated. As a result of the licensing reforms, the burden imposed by licenses
on businesses has been reduced by 19 percent from a 2006 baseline of US$327 million to
US$265 million in 2008. It is expected that by 2012, full implementation of the licensing
reforms will streamline the licensing system and reduce the costs imposed on the private sector
by 48 percent from the baseline in 2006, at no cost to public policy goals. In addition,
introducing competition among land assessment officers (allowing private practitioners) has cut
the time needed to complete land valuation from one month to one week. The licensing reform
program is still far from complete, but the promising initial stages undertaken during the CAS
period have led to the setting up of a broader multi-year FIAS investment climate (IC) program,
managed out of the IFC Nairobi office and in close cooperation with Treasury, Office of the
Prime Minister, Ministry of Local Government and other key public and private sector
stakeholders. The IC Program will continue to support the ongoing implementation of the
licensing reforms, support the adoption of a regulatory reform strategy, introduce targeted Doing
Business reforms at the national and subnational levels, operationalize an electronic registry of
licenses, and tackle other areas identified by stakeholders as priority areas for regulatory
streamlining as well as improving investment generation (investment policy and promotion and
special economic zones) and trade logistics. The 2008 Doing Business report recognized Kenya
among the top reformers worldwide for this effort. An ambitious ongoing initiative (the rapid
results initiative) has been contributing for further reforms with marked success. Some
additional progress has been achieved regarding the average cost of complying with business
start-up regulations (which should not exceed US$100 and two weeks by 2010). Costs as a
percentage of income per capita declined from 46.1 percent to 39.7 percent between 2008 and
2009. The Bank contributed in this area through policy dialogue linked to the Micro, Small, and
Medium Enterprise Competitiveness Project (FY04) and the Pension Reform Dialogue (FY07).
Parastatal and Regulatory Reform
CAS Outcome: Reduce fiscal burden of transfer to parastatals [Partially Achieved]
38.
Parastatals continued to be a fiscal burden although some successful privatizations
provided fiscal relief. While the privatization bill was enacted already in 2005, the privatization
program was discussed by Cabinet only in December 2008 and a Privatization Commission,
making the privatization act operational, was not established until January 2009. Government
issued a Kenya Shilling (KSh) 20 billion bond to the National Bank of Kenya in June 2007 to
offset the insolvency of the bank relating to accumulated non-performing loans (NPLs). Another
94

Ksh 8 billion bond was issued in December 2007 to offset Telkom Kenya Limited (TKL)
liabilities (including pension fund) in preparation of privatization of the company. Initial public
offerings (IPO) have been achieved in the energy and telecommunication sectors including: (i)
sale of a 30 percent share in Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) in May 2006
raising US$108 million; (ii) sale of 51 percent of government shares in TKL to France Telecom
in November 2006 raising US$390 million; and (iii) 25 percent of the government’s stake in
Safaricom14 in June 2008 generally considered a success15 with about 750,000 subscribers and
raising approximately US$800 million. Privatization moved slower in the banking sector with a
strategy to initiate the sale of government shares (in addition to shares held by the national social
security fund) in the National Bank of Kenya submitted to cabinet only by November 2008 (see
also sector specific discussions below). However, this privatization is going on a fast track pace
(exempted by law from additional procedural steps in the new framework), with the Government
in the process of hiring transaction advisers.
39.
The Financial and Legal Sector TA (FY05) provided extensive reports supporting these
efforts. The FY08 CEM analyzed the institutional framework for public private participation in
infrastructure, liquidity in the market for these projects and other issues related to infrastructure
finance. Ongoing policy notes are further detailing this analysis. In addition, the Public Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) provides further support (noted below) in addition to
work by the IFC’s Efficient Securities Markets Institutional Development (ESMID) program
supporting development of local corporate bond markets for east African countries, but also
strengthening of capital markets in general.
Strengthen Regulatory Framework of Parastatals [Achieved]
40.
Outcomes in this area seem moderately satisfactory. Important gains have been made in
the water sector and in the abolition of the Tea Development Authority. As discussed in more
detail below, improved policies were implemented in some marketing boards and they may have
had a positive impact on misappropriations. However, no audit on marketing boards appeared
have been published by the National Audit Office. There is no evidence that governance has
improved. Some legal amendments are still needed for channeling private participation into
roads and energy. For more detailed discussions on progress in strengthening the regulatory
framework for transport, energy and water sector-specific discussions under Theme II.
Monitoring and Evaluation
CAS Outcome: Annual PRSP progress reports of increasingly good quality [Partially
Achieved]
41.
Only two Annual PRSP progress reports were produced with an increase in quality but
limited effect on policy decisions. According to the CAS, indicators to measure PRSP progress
were supposed to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). The
Government’s first IP-ERS Annual Progress Report (APR) for the period FY04 was submitted to
the Bank/IMF staff in July 2005. A second APR, covering FY05, was submitted in September
14

Safaricom used to be jointly owned by TKL and Vodafone Kenya with 60 percent respectively 40 percent of
shares. TKL’s stake was transferred to the treasury after the privatization of the company.
15
Share prices initially rose from a KSh 5 offer price to about KSh 6.5 but plunged recently to about KSh 3.25.

95

2006. A Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) covering both APRs was issued in February 2007.
The JSAN noted progress in monitoring and evaluation between the two reports and pointed out
the focus on results reporting. Indicators were identified to facilitate assessments by
government, civil society, and development partners. In addition, it highlighted that the targets
for performance indicators in the second report were better defined and more realistic than in the
first report. However, the JSAN also regretted delays in issuing of the both reports by
government (without, however, explaining the delay in issuing of the JSAN). This limited their
role and impact on setting the policy agenda. No JSAN has been issued lately.
CAS Outcome: Access to public information and quality of data improved [Achieved]
42.
The Development of the National Statistical System (NSS) Project (FY07) is contributing
to the CAS objectives, although it is still in its initial stage. A fairly adequate institutional
framework is in place with the establishment of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS)
which legally enjoys some independence, with responsibility of establishing linkages among
statistical data producers and users. Through the project, official statistical agencies within NSS
have been provided with appropriate computer hardware and software, and staff members from
these agencies have been trained in data collection and the use of statistical software programs.
As a result, KNBS publications are increasingly being released to the public through the media,
and their findings and recommendations are published by the media, and they form part of the
public debate on poverty and economic trends in the country. More policy-makers and
researchers beginning to use statistics from NSS agencies for operational purposes. (See also the
section on access to information above.) Of particular importance was the noticeable
contribution of StatCap towards building capacity in the collection of sex-disaggregated data
resulting in the National Gender Data Sheet (2009) which contained an updated and
comprehensive set of sex-disaggregated data in key sectors.
Theme II: Reducing the Cost of Doing Business and Improving Investment Climate
Restructuring Financial Services
CAS Outcome: Deepened financial intermediation [Achieved]
43.
Progress under this CAS outcome has been positive as evidenced by increased access to
finance by the private sector. Overall credit to the private sector increased from 23 percent of
GDP to about 27 percent to date. In addition, there has been significant progress in solving the
issue of NPL, which decreased from 26 percent during the time of the CAS preparation to about
7 percent in 2008. It is worth noting that a large part of the fall in NPLs can be attributed to the
government’s recapitalization of the National Bank, see above. This allowed the bank to writeoff its large portfolio of NPLs. While the privatization of the bank remains in limbo, the danger
remains that the bank will accumulate NPLs again. Both indicators – private credit and the size
of the impaired loan book – were part of and closely aligned with the Financial and Legal Sector
TA (FY05), which aims among other things at ensuring broad access to financial and related
legal services (see also below). The project was also expected to contribute to major
improvements in the payments systems, which eventually took place without the support of the
project, but significantly improved the modernization of the system. This was achieved with the
introduction of real time gross settlement systems for large payments. Another supported aspect
is related to regulations for mobile banking.
96

44.
A major component of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME)
Competitiveness Project (FY05) focuses on strengthening financial and non-financial markets to
meet the demands of MSMEs. While progress in the improving the business environment
component continues to be unsatisfactory (see further below), there has been substantial progress
in the access to finance component and the enterprise skills and market linkages component. The
component co-finances: (i) a Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Trust, created in the context of
the loan design, aimed at deepening and expanding the reach of financial services and products
that are available to MSMEs; and (ii) a risk capital fund in Kenya and associated TA facility
aimed at catalyzing new risk capital instruments (mix of debt, equity and quasi-equity) tailored
for SMEs. Both subcomponents show positive progress with currently 60-70 percent of financial
institutions receiving grants from the FSD Trust meeting or exceeding their business plan targets
for MSME outreach and portfolio quality. The risk capital fund has supported 32 deals as of
June 2009, for a total investment portfolio of approximately US$3.6 million at a zero loan loss
rate.
45.
Kenya’s financial system also proved to be resilient to the 2007-08 post-election crisis,
which had very little impact on bank NPLs. The availability of credit provided through other
providers, such as savings and credit cooperatives and micro finance institutions (MFIs), is
significant, and good progress has been made during the CAS period in establishing legal and
regulatory frameworks for both these sub-sectors. Laws have been enacted for both sub-sectors,
the regulatory frameworks for deposit-taking and non-deposit-taking MFIs have been established
and the Ministry of Cooperatives is working towards establishing a regulatory framework for at
least the larger SACCOs. The FLSTAP and MSME Competitiveness (through FSDT) projects
played a key role in the drafting and passing of the SACCO Societies Act 2008 and the
Microfinance Act 2008 - including direct support to two MFIs which became the first two
deposit taking MFIs to get conditional licensing under the new regulations - and the official
publishing of new regulations guiding the licensing and operations of Credit Bureaus. Other
efforts towards implementation of these Acts are underway with FLSTAP support. The FSAP
update will start in September 2009 and will cover key related issues as well further build a
knowledge base to design further reforms as needed.
46.
As relates to latest developments on the financial markets – both internationally and
locally – Kenya’s economy is witnessing a significant slowdown as the fall-out from domestic
developments – residual effect of Kenya’s post-election conflict early in 2008 and the ongoing
food crisis – has been exacerbated by the direct and indirect impacts of global financial crisis.
GDP growth in 2009 is now projected at 3.6 percent, from an earlier estimate of 5.8 percent. The
current account deficit has almost doubled to US$2.1 billion and the capital account has suffered.
These factors combined with a slowdown in tourism earnings and heightened risk aversion
caused significant depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against the US dollar during the third and
fourth quarter of 2008.
47.
The Kenyan financial system was able to withstand the immediate significant
deterioration in exchange rate as the crisis unfolded. The continuing decline in equity prices
reflects concerns about the governance of the market, and the failure hitherto of the authorities to
address these. However the second round effects are proving to be more pronounced. The
banking system appears to be well capitalized based on reported soundness indicators. Increases
97

in the level of NPLs are likely on account of further slowdown in economic activity, with
particular concerns for tourism and construction.
48.
While the net foreign exposure of the banking system is low, as in other countries banks
are increasingly facing difficulty and higher costs in funding themselves abroad, particularly
with longer maturities. Conditions for corporate funding in the local market have also tightened.
CAS Outcome: Expanded access to financial services [Achieved]
49.
There has been good progress toward this CAS outcome evidenced by an increase in the
proportion of adults using financial services. The CAS interpreted this outcome in terms of
access to financial services by the general population, beyond established entrepreneurs. Data
from the last survey on demand of financial services (FINACCESS/FINSCOPE) show a
significant expansion in the proportion of adults that uses financial services provided by formal
financial service providers from 16 percent in 2006 (as the baseline provided in the CAS) to
about 33 percent in 2008. This result implies a banking penetration to lower income sectors, in
addition to a substantive contribution by M-PESA, a popular Safaricom service, which allows
transfers of money using a mobile phone. This indicator is part of the results framework for the
Financial and Legal Sector TA (FLSTA) (FY05), although it has to be acknowledged that the
direct impact of the activities funded by the project on the impressive improvements in Kenya’s
financial outreach have been quite modest. The project’s results framework anticipated a 20
percent increase of accounts in the financial sector. In reality, the amount of accounts in the
Kenyan banking sector increased by about 180 percent (from about 2.2 to 6.1 million). Despite
significant progress on outcomes, the FLSTA project has faced various shortcomings during the
review period. Initial problems with project management have been resolved, although
challenges remain with respect to procurement processing and disbursements, which are being
addressed under the ongoing preparation for restructuring.
CAS Outcome: Enhanced economic governance in banking sector [Partially Achieved]
50.
Bank assistance to achieve the CAS outcomes has given mixed results. Some
restructuring of financial services has taken place with a view to enhancing economic
governance in the banking sector. The FLSTA (FY05) contributed to progress, including
providing assistance to drafting of revised legislation in a number of key areas, which still
remains to be presented and approved by Parliament, given back-log in legal drafting at the
Attorney General’s office. Risk-based supervision has been initiated at the Central Bank and the
Insurance Act has been amended to establish an autonomous Insurance Regulatory.
Amendments to the Banking Act, Building Societies Act, and a Companies Bill have been
drafted but not yet submitted to the Attorney General's office. The Proceeds of Crime and AntiMoney Laundering Bill, 2008 has been drafted but parliamentary approval is still pending. The
legal framework for Credit information sharing among the banks has been established and the
authorities issued regulations in September 2008 for credit bureaus, with the licensing process
underway. An autonomous insurance regulator, the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) was
established, including support from the project with further strengthening ongoing. A significant
agenda remains outstanding as regards reform of the governance and investment management
practices of the National Social Security Fund and establishing a fiscally sustainable public
sector pension scheme.
98

Private Sector Development
CAS Outcome: Telecom costs reduced. [Partially Achieved]
51.
There has been considerable success in liberalizing the telecom sector, but costs remain
relatively high. Liberalization accelerated during the review period with the partial privatization
of the fixed-line incumbent TKL as well as the IPO for Safaricom Limited (see above), the first
licensed mobile operator.16 Since 2004, additional competition to provide telecommunications
services has been generated by the licensing of four Internet backbone suppliers, seven public
data operators, and five commercial Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) operators. In 2005,
Kenya was among the first African countries to legalize the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),
which actually resulted in a drop of international phone traffic (both outgoing and incoming) due
to the increased use of VoIP. However, costs of international calls on a mobile phone decreased
only marginally from an average of Ksh 99.79 per international call in 2004 to Ksh 93.95 in
2007. While the 2003 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) cited telecommunications services
as one of the major constraints faced by the private sector, the 2007 ICA did no longer cite them
as a major obstacle for doing business.
CAS Outcome: Improved environment for private sector investment. [Achieved]
52.
The Cost of Doing Business Report did record several improvements over the review
period, notably the reduction in the cost and time it takes to start a business. It also recorded a
reduction in the cost of dealing with construction permits and a reduction in the time for exports.
Cost of starting a business has fallen from 54 percent of income per capita in 2004 to 40 percent
in 2008; time to start a business reduced from 60 days in 2004 to 30 days in 2008, leading to
recognition of Kenya as a “global Top-10 reformer” in 2008. The 2008 ICA provides further
insights into key reforms needed, which has been informing both the authorities and the Bank on
the design of policy actions.
53.
However, the Bank’s contribution to these outcomes is not obvious. The MSME project
has a business environment component geared at reducing the cost of compliance with business
regulations for the formal sector and creating incentives for informal MSMEs to graduate to
higher levels of formality. Implementation of this component was considerably delayed and
rated unsatisfactory. In addition, the project’s results framework uses different indicators than
the ones suggested in the CAS PR which makes it further difficult to assess the Bank’s
contribution.
54.
As mentioned before, key recommendations of the Business Licensing Report were
implemented with some substantive progress achieved. Further progress is underway through a
multi-year Investment Climate Program by FIAS, in close cooperation with related Bank projects
and key government and private sector stakeholders. Introducing competition among land
assessment officers (allowing private practitioners) has cut the time needed to complete land
16

More licenses were issued to Celtel in 2000 and Econet Wireless Kenya in 2003.

99

valuation from one month to one week. Progress is yet to be achieved regarding the average cost
of complying with business start-up regulations (which should not exceed US$100 and two
weeks by 2010). The Bank contributed to achieving these objectives through the MSME Project
and the Pension Reform Dialogue (FY07).
CAS Outcome: Generate employment in formal sector [Partially Achieved]
55.
No data or evidence suggests that this outcome was achieved. Nevertheless, the number
of formally registered MSMEs may have increased by at least 25 percent by 2007 over 2004
level. Important progress has been made in reducing private sector costs in the area of
international trade: the transit time from Mombasa to Kigali has gone from 19 days to nine,
exceeding the target set under the Regional Project (Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation of
2005). Given the importance of regional trade, this increases job demand and is strongly
supported by the business community. There has been some progress, too, in establishing
Community Based Systems (CBS) in the Port of Mombasa although the system is not in
operation yet. Implementation of the business environment component that was designed to
contribute to the creation of a one-stop shop to facilitate business registration and to create a
unified tax system for MSMEs of the relevant MSME Project was delayed, but was undertaken
by other laws or initiatives beyond the Ministry of Industrialization. The MSME
Competitiveness project has supported formal employment directly through the risk capital fund
(929 jobs created and/or sustained as of June 2009) and indirectly through skills development
activities aimed at increasing productivity and production in the leather, cotton, coffee and
pyrethrum sectors in the value chain subcomponent. There is also evidence of improvements in
terms of acreage, better investments, better prices etc. on the value chain sub-component
(especially for coffee and cotton).
Infrastructure
CAS Outcome: Enhance Kenya’s role as regional trade hub and strengthen Kenya’s links
to international markets [Partially Achieved]
56.
This CAS outcome can be considered partially achieved based on progress on some
monitoring indicators. Bank contributions have been mixed as operations have not achieved
substantive results. Tons of freight handled by the Mombasa port as well as the numbers of
passengers passing through Nairobi international airport increased steadily during the review
period. However, activities under the Northern Corridor project were delayed and the Additional
Financing, which covers key cost increases, originally planned for FY08 was not approved until
the third quarter of FY09. This delayed Bank contribution to these outcomes. Another key
milestone was for Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) clearance by International Aviation
Safety Assessment (IASA) and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) obtaining Category
1 clearance by the US Transportation Security Administration for direct flights to and from the
United States by 2007. This was delayed but finally achieved in April 2009 with facilitation of
the Bank and the Safe Skies for Africa program (USA) through the Northern Corridor Project.
Among other things a common regulatory framework for aviation safety and security has been
adopted at the East African Community level and the joint Civil Aviation Safety and Security
Oversight Agency (CASSOA) has been established. Arrangements are under way for its full
implementation. The Northern Corridor project aims at reducing travel times between Mombasa
100

and Malaba (at Ugandan border) by 25 percent, but work under the four major contracts of the
project is not yet completed. However, the improvement of the Maji ya Chumvi – Miritini road
section, financed by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) and Lanet-Njoro Turnoff funded by
IDA under the project, already resulted in a significant reduction in travel time from Nakuru to
Mombasa from about eleven hours to less than eight hours. In addition, FIAS, the investment
climate advisory service, will be providing technical assistance on Trade Logistics. The objective
of the activities supported under this program is to enhance East Africa regional trade and
growth through increasing the efficiency of intra-regional trade, and the reduction of regulatory
risks and costs for businesses. Interventions will take place both at the regional level (EAC) as
well as at the national level. Results would be measured in higher intra regional trade and
investment, but also through reduced costs of individual business regulatory transactions.
Interventions fall along core BEE product areas: Regulatory Simplification (including Trade
Logistics, Business Licensing, Doing Business, Tax Simplification) and Investment Generation
(Special Economic Zones and Investment Policy).
CAS Outcome: Strengthen institutional and regulatory framework to improve
maintenance of road infrastructure [Achieved]
57.
The government has adopted a comprehensive roads policy and approved the new Kenya
Roads Act, 2007, which, inter alia, allows the setting up of three autonomous roads authorities to
streamline ownership, management, accountability and financing (National Highways Authority,
Rural Roads Authority, and Urban Roads Authority). The government has also advanced the
establishment of these roads authorities with the appointment of the members to their respective
Boards and their chairpersons. Chief Executives and senior managers are also on board and the
authorities have begun functioning. The Bank contributed to this institutional objective through
the Northern Corridor Transport SIL (FY04). Air transport has also benefitted from institutional
improvement. The KCAA has been staffed with adequate personnel. KCAA is now nearly fully
staffed for safety and airworthiness inspections. It has needed licensing specialists, although
retaining qualified and experienced local staff is difficult because of the high demand and better
pay in the private sector.
58.
Institutional capacity, operational, and governance milestones have been achieved in the
recent past in the road sub-sector service delivery, including: (i) establishment of the Kenya
Roads Board which provides the opportunity for major improvements in policy direction,
expenditure priorities and accountability; (ii) introduction of a fuel levy into the Road Fund as a
means of mobilizing domestic resources for road maintenance - generating nearly US$230
million annually; (iii) decentralization of disbursement of road maintenance funds, decision
making and implementation through the District Road Committees which empowers local
communities through local decision making; (iv) introduction of a rural roads strategy and labor
based technologies under the Roads 2000 Program which is having a major positive impact on
rural accessibility, employment and poverty reduction; (v) local production and training of well
qualified engineers in the public and private sector; (vi) prevalence of an established construction
and consulting industry with small contractors throughout most of the country and a dynamic
private sector; and (vii) reduction of vehicle overloading on Kenyan roads which was widespread
until the recent Administrative Order banning the use of four axle trucks and a move by
government to privatize management of weigh stations.
101

CAS Outcome: Improve road sector management through private sector participation
[Partially Achieved]
59.
The new Kenya Roads Act 2007 allows for private sector participation in the road sector.
There are no restrictions on public-private partnership under the existing laws of Kenya.
However, as suggested in the PPIAF study, some amendments are needed in parts of the
regulatory framework in order to promote private investment. Among such would be
amendments to the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, the Government Contracts Act, and
the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury (Incorporated) Act, as well as to subsidiary legislation
in the form of regulations. The proposed amendments will clarify the legality of public private
partnerships (PPP) and the regulations needed to define the responsibilities and obligations of the
Public Procurement Oversight Authority, the Privatization Commission, line ministries, state
corporations, and local government vis-à-vis the Ministry of Finance. The objective of offering
one segment of the Northern Corridor road for private sector financing and management was
achieved. Bids for tolling of the Nairobi Urban Toll Road were invited. Negotiations for the
award of a 30-year concession to the private sector to build and operate an urban toll road,
including a fly-over through the city of Nairobi along the Northern Corridor, are at an advanced
stage. Meanwhile the members to the Boards of the new road authorities have representation
from the private sector including road users.
CAS Outcome: Reduce costs and improve reliability of energy services [Partially Achieved]
60.
The Bank’s support was directly aligned with the CAS outcome. Reliability of electricity
services has improved with the support of the Energy Sector Recovery Project (ESRP) (FY04).
The indicators measuring quality and reliability of electricity services have improved over the
CAS period – voltage fluctuations reduced and temporary interruptions of electricity supply
decreased from about 11,000 annual incidents in 2004 (prior to the project) to 4,253 incidents in
2008. Moreover, the average time to restore power supply after an interruption fell from about 8
hours to 6 hours.
61.
However, progress fell slightly short of meeting the CAS target of reduction in system
losses to 15 percent by FY07 (from about 19 percent in FY04). This target proved too ambitious
and most recent figures estimate system losses at about 17 percent. Improvements in system
reliability and losses are related to the private management from 2006-08 of the Kenya Power
and Lighting Company Ltd. (KPLC), which resulted in marked improvements of operational and
financial performance of the company. However, delays in investments in distribution
rehabilitation and government’s aggressive expansion of the electricity network to rural areas,
which was not anticipated when the CAS was prepared slowed-down the achievement of the loss
reduction target.
62.
KPLC’s commercial performance during the CAS period improved. The number of days
it takes for KPLC to collect its receivables dropped from 70 days to 58 in 2004-08 (exceeding
the target set) and the operating efficiency ratio improved from 35 percent to 31 percent in 200608.17
17

Operating Efficiency ratio is measured as KPLC’s operating expenses divided by its operating revenue.

102

63.
Notwithstanding these improvements, according to the 2008 ICA, electricity is still one
of the main infrastructure bottlenecks affecting Kenyan enterprises (together with transport)
resulting in 70 percent of firms owning generators that are adding to their operation costs. Close
to 80 percent of firms in Kenya are experiencing losses due to power interruptions, which costs
firms about 7 percent of sales. This compares unfavorably with countries at similar levels of
development. Additional Financing for the Energy Sector Recovery Project (approved in April
2009) is investing in increased distribution rehabilitation, which will help reduce losses and
supply interruptions. In addition, access to energy contributes to gains in women’s economic
empowerment as it reduces the burden of unproductive domestic chores, increases their access to
markets, provides safety in public spaces, and promotes SMEs.
CAS Outcome: Ensure increased access to modern energy services to reduce household
cost and time associated with traditional forms of energy [Achieved]
64.
The CAS outcome is achieved evidenced by a significant increase in new electricity
customers. The Energy Sector Recovery Project (FY04) reports an increase in the rate of
connecting new customers between 2004 and 2008 from 40,000 to 180,000 per year significantly
surpassing the CAS target for 80,000 new customers per year. While the yearly connections
increased, electrification rate in Kenya remains low at around 18 percent. Government’s target is
to reach an electrification rate of 40 percent by 2020, which would require more than a doubling
of the current customer base. To meet this target, the Government, with Bank support, is
currently developing an ambitious least-cost investment program, aimed at electrifying one
million households in five years. Additional Financing to the Energy Sector Recovery Project
planned for late-FY09 is expected to contribute to further increase of electricity access in
Kenya’s urban and peri-urban areas. The CAS also aimed at an increase in the consumption of
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) aligned with Government’s efforts to promote expansion of LPG
use in the rural areas (away from fuel wood and/or kerosene). The Energy Sector Recovery
Project provided support in this area albeit at a much smaller scale, mainly supporting a
feasibility study for a new LPG storage and distribution facility, which is now being constructed
by a private company. Furthermore the ESRP helped the Kenya Bureau of Standards to improve
its capacity for setting and monitoring of standards for petroleum products.
CAS Outcome: Improve institutional and regulatory framework for effective energy
service provision [Achieved]
65.
Progress was made in strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework of the
energy sector. The Bank’s contribution was channeled through the Energy Sector Recovery
Project (FY04) as the latest in the series of IDA-financed energy projects that supported the
successful transformation of the Kenyan energy sector for more than a decade. Major
achievements include: (i) unbundling of a failing integrated utility into two corporatized
commercially-oriented generation and distribution companies (KenGen and KPLC respectively);
(ii) introduction of competition (in generation) and private sector participation in both generation
and distribution; (iii) adoption of a comprehensive energy policy in 2004 and promulgation of a
new Energy Law in 2006 to support the implementation of the policy; (iv) establishment of an
autonomous regulatory agency, which is fully operational; (v) transfer of rural electrification
planning and implementation from the Ministry of Energy and KPLC to a special purpose Rural
103

Electrification Authority to improve accountability and transparency; and (vi) establishment of a
new tariff structure and tariff review process that was implemented in 2008 (a tariff increase of
24 percent accompanied the measures). The Bank has also produced an Energy Sector Strategy
Note (FY05) and a Rural Electrification Study (FY06); both feed into ongoing work in the
sector. As a result of the capacity building activities under the Energy Sector Recovery project,
the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Energy, the regulator, and other sector entities to
implement the new regulatory framework improved.
CAS Outcome: Establish fiduciary accountability in generation and distribution of
electricity [Achieved]
66.
With the enactment and promulgation of the Energy Act and the separation of accounts
and tariffs for transmission and distribution at KPLC, this outcome was substantially achieved.
Moreover, a new cost-reflective tariff structure and a tariff review process were implemented in
2008.
CAS Outcome: Reduce costs and improve reliability of water services in Nairobi
[Achieved]
67.
The key CAS outcome was achieved with significant Bank contribution. Key indicators
for the water supply objective were aligned with the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Institutional
Restructuring Project (FY04-08), which directly contributed to the increase in the annual volume
of water delivered to Nairobi consumers from 75 million m3 per year in 2003 to 94 million m3 by
2007 (above the CAS target). Another indicator reported by the project, is a reduction in
unaccounted for water, which went from 50 percent to 43 percent in 2004-07. The contribution
by the project seems evident given that the improvements took place during the project’s
implementation period and the fact that other water service providers in Kenya that were not
covered by the project did not achieve similar results. One milestone included as a “revised
indicator” in the CAS PR was the establishment of new institutions as called for in the 2002
Water Act. These new institutions included new water services boards which contract out the
delivery of services to various water service providers. These institutions contributed
significantly to major progress in the sector (see below). In order to expand further water access,
the Water and Sanitation Service Improvement Project is under implementation since FY08.
CAS Outcome: Enhance water security in water-scarce communities [Achieved]
68.
Despite a lack of direct reporting on this indicator, sufficient evidence indicates
satisfactory progress. The second phase of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project
(ARLMP) (FY03; Additional Financing FY07) emphasizes the importance of access to water
resources for development in the arid lands. The project concentrates its support on strategic
investment in water sources for development or drought preparedness, rehabilitating existing
sources where possible, and ensuring that new sources of development be properly planned in
the context of the natural resource management framework. The project also supports the
creation of river water user associations on a pilot basis with a view to strengthening community
based water resource management as well as the prevention and resolution of conflicts over
access to and use of water resources. The CAS indicator asked for the implementation of 44
community-based projects. A progress report for 2007-08 points out that during that year about
104

44 water projects were supported. The most recent progress report indicates that over half of the
investments made to date under the project enhanced community access to water. It is estimated
that the average distance to the nearest water point has been reduced by more than half. Over
200 boreholes, 500 pans and dams and over 500 shallow wells have been constructed,
rehabilitated or improved over the life of the project.
CAS Outcome: Establish conducive institutional and regulatory environment to ensure
financial viability of future investments in sustainable water service delivery [Achieved]
69.
The Nairobi Water and Sewerage Institutional Restructuring Project (FY04-08) assisted
on strengthening the institutional and service delivery framework for delivering efficient and
sustainable services to the population. The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC)
is fully ring-fenced and legally separated from the City Council. Progress seems in line with
objectives as agreements setting up the framework for service delivery are being respected by all
signatory parties. This framework provides for the autonomy of institutions, including clear
roles, responsibilities and contractual arrangements/relationships between institutions. The
framework provided stability to Nairobi water services. At the NWSC, collection efficiency as
an expression of better governance, increased from 65 percent to 74 percent during 2004-07.
The FY08 Water and Sanitation Service Improvement Project aims at improving this indicator to
over 90 percent in Nairobi and other cities across Kenya. Billing efficiency at NWSC is
relatively high, over 90 percent. The indicator actually decreased during the project
implementation but this actually reflects improvement in the company’s billing policy which
includes not billing unverified accounts while aggressively reducing such accounts. Late billing
declined from six months to zero in 2004-07. Revenues increased from Ksh 1.5 billion to Ksh
3.2 billion during 2004-07.
Regional Integration and Trade
CAS Outcome: Strengthen regional links [Partially Achieved]
70.
Important milestones where reached during the review period on establishing the East
African Community (EAC) as the critical regional trade agreement for Kenya. The EAC
customs was established in 2005, with considerable medium-to long term impact on Kenya's
regional trade, overall market access and hence growth potential. Nominal rate of protection
declined from 16 percent in 2004 to about 13 percent at present. The marketing for coffee is
being liberalized with direct coffee sales allowed, but liberalization is still pending. The
pyrethrum marketing board also is yet to be privatized but a bill has been tabled (see below).
71.
As the EAC's most important manufacturing base and largest market, the region provided
Kenya with a (almost) free goods market (with tariff barriers almost gone, a short sensitive
product list, and preparation underway to bring down non tariff measures) with the potential to
transform its goods trade to higher levels of value-added. Kenya is leading the region in
developing integrated supply chains not only within the country, but across the region. It is now
an important source of machinery, transport equipment and chemicals needed, significantly
moving up from agriculture and agro-processed products and crude raw materials. Beyond the
region, Kenya was able to ensure its favored access into the EU, which currently absorbs about
one third of Kenya’s exports.
105

72.
During the review period, the Bank supported a request by the EAC to help the region
analyze and move forward with various difficult policy issues. This support is reflected in
various Economic and Sector Work and Technical Assistance, e.g. an October 2008 Synthesis
Report on Non-Tariff Measures on Goods Trade in the East African Community (for Burundi,
Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda); and a September 2007 report on options for
Strengthening EAC’s Trade Integration. These reports positively influenced the joint signing of
an Economic Partnership Agreement between the EAC and the European Union,18 the discussion
of NTMs in the EAC Council of Ministers for moving forward the Common Market agenda, the
development of a work program for the Kenya National Monitoring Committee on NTMs, etc.
Further support to this agenda is ongoing and will continue during the next CAS.
Theme III: Reducing Vulnerability and Strengthening Communities
Agricultural Competitiveness
CAS Outcome: Systems for agricultural technology development and transfers are
improved [Partially Achieved]
73.
This CAS objective was closely aligned with the Agriculture Productivity Project (FY0409), which aimed to support the generation, dissemination, and adoption of agriculture
technology. Overall, the project contributed to setting-up of an institutional framework and pilot
activities for agriculture research and extension. The National Agricultural Sector Extension
Policy was approved by Cabinet in June 2008 and four extension approaches have been tested in
20 districts. Additional progress took place with respect to a national livestock and dairy policy,
a draft agriculture research policy, as well as some reforms in the coffee subsector. The project
also facilitated carrying-out of agriculture research, training of researchers, capacity building of
research institutions, empowerment of farmers and strengthening of demand services as well as
piloting of PPPs in provision and financing of extension services. Despite this progress, the
project fell short of reporting on many tangible outcomes, including the opportunities generated
for both women and men. For example, it did not record the increase in yields of targeted crops
under the project as suggested by the CAS (which expected yields to rise by 5 percent per year).
Outcomes that the project did record include implementation of 1,100 enterprise development
plans by 1,115 farmer groups in 20 districts, with 980 service providers. On a national level,
there has been a considerable improvement in wheat yields, which increased by about 21 percent
during 1990-2006. However, maize yields stagnated over the last years despite considerable
efforts in terms of price support, research and agricultural extension (see more below).
74.
The MSME Competitiveness project has achieved some significant results in the cotton,
coffee, pyrethrum and leather sectors through targeted BDS services provided under the value
chain subcomponent. This US$4 million subcomponent of the project currently has 41 ongoing
projects in the four sectors. In the coffee sector, the most developed value-chain being supported,
18

Kenya, as a non-LDC, would have reverted to EU’s less favorable General System of Preferences (GSP) in
January 2008, following the expiration of the Cotonou Agreement. It would have faced significant losses of market
access compared to the immediate duty-free quota-free access for 100 percent of its EU exports granted under the
interim EPA.

106

key achievements include: assistance to two coffee cooperative societies to get certification
(resulting in an estimated 8,732 farmers getting product certification), a reduction of the payment
lag for coffee farmers and progress on work to develop local standards for Kenyan coffee.

CAS Outcome: Agricultural market reforms are implemented to increase proportion of
end market value received by smallholders [Not Achieved]
75.
There has been a slow and uneven progress on agriculture market reforms in the different
sub-sectors. Markets reforms impacted individual agriculture sub-sectors to different degrees.
Wheat, horticulture (fruits and vegetables), and dairy have done well. On the other hand, coffee
production declined sharply, while other major crops such as maize and sugar have stagnated or
grown only slowly. There is a strong correlation between the agriculture performances and the
policy, institutional and regulatory framework in which they operate. Generally, agriculture subsectors with a high level of market-led evolution are performing well. During the period under
review, the following reform efforts were undertaken: (i) coffee: a new coffee act from 2002
devolves marketing functions to marketing agents and, among other things, allows freedom in
choosing auctioneers. A 2006 amendment allowed for direct selling of coffee. Nevertheless, the
coffee sector continues to suffer from politicized smallholder marketing arrangements; (ii)
pyrethrum: Direct intervention in the pyrethrum sector has resulted in disenchantment of
smallholders with a sector in which Kenya had been a world leader. A draft policy on
liberalization that would separate regulation and marketing functions of the Pyrethrum Board of
Kenya through the creation of a new trading company was tabled in 2006. The MSME
Competitiveness project has been contributing to policy discussions on reforming the Pyrethrum
Board of Kenya through its APEX committee on pyrethrum that brings together various actors
along the pyrethrum value chain, including the Pyrethrum Board of Kenya; (iii) cotton: in the
cotton sector the MSME Competitiveness project was instrumental in the creation of the Kenyan
Cotton Development Authority and the cotton-pricing model currently in use; (iv) dairy: dairy
production was boosted by opening up the traditional cooperative marketing structures to
competitive forces and a more commercial outlook. The 2007 Dairy Development Policy
intended to legalize small-scale traders and the separation of regulation and promotion functions
at the Kenya Dairy Board; (v) sugar: while the only privatized sugar factory performs well, the
other five publicly owned sugar factories continued to make losses.19
76.
The Bank continued to emphasize the importance of agriculture reforms on smallholders’
wellbeing, but with only limited impact. The Bank conducted a Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment PSIA (FY05-07) on the impact of reforms on the maize sector20 on smallholders’
welfare. Specifically, the PSIA analyzed the effects of a potential withdrawal of the National
Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) from direct operations in the domestic maize market on
household income levels. The findings suggested that NCPB activities raise market prices for
maize, transferring income from urban consumers and the majority of small-scale farm
households. The findings of the PSIA were picked up by a detailed Agriculture Policy Review:
Current Trends and Future Options for Pro-Poor Agricultural Growth (FY08). As the review
19

Sugar is an important cash crop for a large number of smallholder famers in a poor region in Western Kenya, and
reforms in the sector need to be considered carefully.

20

Reforms in the maize market are seen as having an impact on 98 percent of smallholders.

107

found, Government used the NCPB to intervene in the maize market with limited impact on the
stated objective of stabilizing prices. Issues emerging from an analysis of the various links in the
value chain highlighted the need to: (i) invest in rural roads and marketing infrastructure; and (ii)
develop an institutional framework for agriculture marketing to shorten supply chains by helping
build more trust and efficiency in the system. The findings are in line with the pipeline Kenya
Agriculture Productivity and Agribusiness Project (FY09), which, among other things will focus
on agribusiness and market development to support value chains aiming at value-addition and
linking producers to input and output markets, incorporating a strong gender dimension.
Environmental Management
CAS Outcome: Tourism related to wildlife increases [Not Achieved]
77.
Tourism in Kenya increased during the period under review and almost doubled between
2000 and 2007. Tourism arrivals were down about 35 percent in 2008 compared with 2007,
probably due to the impact of the election crisis in addition to the global economic downturn. It
would be a stretch, however, to suggest the Bank’s program would have contributed to tourism
increase. There is almost no relationship between this CAS outcome and the Bank’s actual
activities, except maybe for a small GEF project which is aiming at improving wildlife
conservation in Nairobi National Park. The National Resource Management Project (FY07)
aims to enhance the institutional capacity to manage water and forest resources. The project
start-up was severely affected by the post-election crisis, and implementation has slowed-down
substantially. Only recently have project activities accelerated.
CAS Outcome: Increase development prospects in one of the poorest regions [Partially
Achieved]
78.
The Western Kenya CDD and Flood Mitigation Project (FY07) covers ten districts in
Western Province and two (Siaya and Bondo) in the Nyanza Province, which are among the
poorest regions in Kenya. The focus of this project demonstrated Government’s commitment to
reduce poverty through direct targeting of communities of poor and vulnerable men and women,
and was directly aligned with the added attention on equity of the CAS PR. Government further
agreed to a decentralized delivery system for a more efficient use of resources. Budgetary
resources were allocated and a multi-sector approach agreed, which necessitated anchoring the
project at the Office of the President. Although the project is in its early stages, there are
indications that community investments, youth development initiatives, malaria interventions
and flood mitigation aspects of this project will have a positive impact on these poor
communities. It is notable that the early warning system resulted in increased preparedness
during October/November 2008 flooding as communities rescued themselves and secured their
assets.
79.
The CAS fell short of providing sufficient elements for a comprehensive evaluation or to
capture all the activities aligned with this outcome. The only indicator was the development of a
regional framework for improving fisheries management did not achieve expected results as yet.
In the area of the Lake Victoria, the cross-country coordination for resource development
achieved only partial results. The Western Kenya Integrated Environmental Management
Project, despite some initial delays during FY06, produced encouraging results in providing
108

sustainable livelihood options for up-scaling. Some select results include the development of a
number of participatory action plans, the delineation of micro catchment/land management units,
organization of mobilization meetings, etc. However, the pilot character of this relatively small
(US$4.1 million) GEF financed project has been limiting its contribution. On a more positive
note, the second phase of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project (FY03; Additional
Financing FY07) has achieved its stated objective of decreasing the vulnerability of the drought
prone areas of Kenya by: (i) increasing access to key social services through district level and
community level investments in water, education and health, halving the distance the population
has to travel to these facilities; (ii) reducing response time to drought from six months to one
month, and improving the targeting and quality of response; and (iii) mainstreaming the issues
most relevant to pastoral communities in key national policy frameworks such as Vision 2030,
the Land Policy, Gender Policy and other national policies.
CAS Outcome: Establish the framework and regulations for improved water resource
management [Partially Achieved]
80.
The Bank supported the establishment of the Water Resource Management Authority in
2002, as a water resources regulator. Supported by the first Lake Victoria Environmental Project
(LVEMP I; FY02-06), there was several progress with respect to this outcome. First, Kenya was
the only country that developed water quality standards, which govern domestic and industrial
effluents discharged into river and sewerage systems. The standards were approved by the
National Environmental Management Authority, gazetted, and are supposed to be enforced by
the water authorities water resources department. Second, there was substantial progress in
establishing cooperative management mechanisms for water resources management with the
Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) established by the three countries in July 2005.21
Third, the ICR for Kenya LVEMP I rated the institutional development impact as substantial,
partly due to the mainstreaming of project implementation in the Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute (KARI), and partly because of the capacity built at various institutions.22 Fourth, while
there was a failure to exchange harmonized fisheries data at regional level it was not due to weak
planning, but rather structural. As sovereign countries, with no legal framework for sharing data,
it was difficult for countries to do so. The Protocol now requires all partner states to share data
through the LVBC, not only for fisheries, but also water resources data. Finally, while the
project is falling short on reporting more tangible outcomes, the LVEMP I did not have
Logframe when it was originally prepared and approved. However, the M&E improved after the
task team retrofitted the Logframe and monitoring indicators in 2003, following a stocktaking
exercise.
81.
The Western Kenya Integrated Environmental Management Project GEF (FY05)
promotes a set of integrated ecosystem management interventions. The project successfully
supports improving government capacity to conserve critical ecosystems to reduce water shocks
in catchment areas. This objective remains highly relevant taking into consideration the
continued deterioration of the natural resource base and its critical importance for water supply
21

The LVBC is mandated by protocol on Sustainable Lake Victoria Development ratified by the three countries in
November 2004. LVEMP I played a key role in the establishment of this regional institution mandated to
oversee/coordinate sustainable utilization of the shared transboundary water resources.

4 Ph.D.s and 28 MSc degrees, plus many short courses.

and power generation. The project piloted relevant show cases of integrated land management
approaches, which can easily be upscaled elsewhere. Specifically, the project showed that
continued involvement of local communities in the decision making, subsequent training and
exchange visits leads to greater community empowerment and environmental problem solving
including higher uptake of new technologies. Within three years, the project contributed the
raising and subsequent plantation of about one million tree seedlings of assorted species by the
communities.
Strengthen Communities and Local Governments
CAS Outcome: Improve service delivery to targeted rural areas [Achieved]
82.
There has been progress towards this CAS outcome in the Districts targeted by the
second phase of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project. The key indicator, increase in
access to rural water in targeted areas has been achieved. The Bank contributed to the
achievement through the broadening of the scope and level of investment through the FY07
additional financing, originally focused on reducing livelihood vulnerability and enhanced food
security. The original project objective was expanded to take into account scaled up activities
focused on the provision of basic services such as water, education and health. Distance to
water, schools and health centers have been halved. In addition, the project supported a
successful mobile school initiative with thirty mobile schools function in six districts allowing
1,139 boys and 956 girls to attend school. The model and financing of the schools is now being
provided by the Ministry of Education. Under the community driven development component,
430,312 beneficiaries received improved access to water for domestic consumption and livestock
through water kiosks, water pans, boreholes, shallow wells and water tanks. Under the drought
management component, investments in water development have resulted in the construction,
improvement and rehabilitation of well over 500 boreholes, water supply systems, dams, shallow
wells, spring protection, pans and tanks.
CAS Outcome: Strengthen emergency response [Achieved]
83.
The key indicator for this outcome was the operationalization of a drought and disaster
management system with all evidence indicating successful achievement through support from
the Arid Lands Project, which contributed to putting in place a drought contingency fund for
nonfood drought-related expenditures. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) credited the
first phase of the project for having “established a drought early warning and response system
recognized by all stakeholders as successful in the eleven districts most adversely affected by
drought”. The second phase expanded the system, which is managed by the Bank and cofinanced by the European Commission,23 across 22 districts and evidence suggests that this
expansion allowed for the response to the drought emergencies quick and on well targeted basis.
The system allowed for the response to the 2005/06 drought to be faster and better targeted
compared to previous years. The Bank reacted expeditiously to the 2005/06 drought and
expanded the project’s reach from 22 to 28 districts through additional financing approved in
July 2006. One of the achievements of the drought emergency response was stocking and
23

Efforts are underway to put in place a multi-donor fund.

110

restocking which particularly benefitted women who would otherwise be destitute after they lose
their stock.
84.
The Western Kenya CDD and Flood Mitigation Project (FY07) is also aligned with this
CAS outcome. The project aims to empower local communities to engage in sustainable and
wealth creating livelihood activities and reduce their vulnerability to flooding. It seems to be on
track, but still fails to report on any tangible progress indicators. The project was specifically
mentioned by the CAS PR as a pilot to test mechanisms “[…] that would measure what changes
in poverty can be attributed specifically to a given project.” Baseline and follow-up household
survey samples were supposed to show the project’s contribution to outcomes and provide
feedback to improve implementation. However, a household and community survey is still
being analyzed and plans for community and youth investment projects are being reviewed.
Some rehabilitation work on the dykes in the Budalangi plain, aiming at ultimately reducing the
cost of floods in this flood-prone area, has been completed.
CAS Outcome: Strengthen capacity of targeted local governments (predictable flow of
resources, and downward and upward accountability) [Achieved]
85.
The Agricultural Productivity Project (FY04-09) included components to build
consensus for the reform of extension services and the empowerment of farmers and to
implement pilot interventions in 20 districts for testing innovative and decentralized
extension/research/education activities. According to recent assessments, pluralistic extension
approaches and client empowerment support activities have already been tested in 20 pilot
districts. Therefore, the target of 20 client forums functioning at district and divisional level
appears to have been achieved. However, there is a need to improve on the collection of sexdisaggregated data and this will redressed by the KAPAP.
86.
The Bank contributed to increasing the capacity of communities in arid lands to deal with
drought cycles in an effective way in order to protect and develop their livelihoods. The Bank
has, with substantial community co-financing (30 percent), financed micro-projects throughout
the several phases of the Arid Lands Project. During the implementation of these projects, elite
capture at the community level became clear and was acknowledged. Subsequently, improved
participatory methodologies were adopted to address this issue. Substantial institutional
development was brought about participation and strong co-financing yielded positive results.
The project's community orientation contributed to resolving inter-ethnic conflicts, increasing
voice and advocacy for the beneficiaries, and deepening national political awareness of the
extreme problems faced in the Northeast, including the dramatic inequalities in terms of resource
access of women and men. Some participatory process shortcomings were identified and
corrected in timely fashion. For this reason the proportion of people in each ASAL district
assessed as needing free food aid actually decreased (even if one factors-in the severity of the
drought). In fact, from the 2000-01 drought to the 2004-06 drought five percent fewer people
were assessed as needing and receiving food aid. The voice of people from project districts in
local and national development has been louder. This was reflected in the completion of the
draft on Arid Land Policies, now before Cabinet. The draft includes policies on pastoral land
issues. Locating project management under the Office of the President proved to be an effective
way of getting the attention of public servants and facilitating success.
111

Theme IV: Investing in People
Health: Expanded Basic Health Care
CAS Outcome: Improve access to health services [Partially Achieved]
87.
This CAS outcome is considered partially achieved based on positive progress on
selected indicators as well as unsatisfactory project performance. New evidence shows that the
child mortality rate decreased from 115 per 1,000 in 2003 to 74 per 1,000 in 2008-09. Infant
mortality also decreased from 77 per 1,000 in 2003 to 52 per 1000 in 2008-09. The rational for
the improvement of these indicators may be attributed to various improvements in other health
factors: improvement in the vaccination program (particularly measles), malaria interventions
(especially bed nets), progress with the HIV/AIDS program (increase in use of ARVs and
pediatric care), as well as the effects of positive economic growth. However, successful
improvements in the access to health services may not necessarily be credited solely to Bank
activities. There is also evidence that suggests that the maternal mortality rate has increased due
to post election violence, with particularly high rates in the Central and Eastern Provinces.
88.
The Decentralized Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS Project (FY00-FY07) was
directly aligned with this CAS outcome and included infant mortality as a key PDO indicator
notwithstanding, as the project’s ICR pointed out, that this indicator is affected by a plethora of
factors beyond Bank activities. The project attempted to expand the number of districts
implementing integrated district work-plans and to promote rural and NGOs participation,
including participation in contract service delivery. The project did not, however, ensure the
establishment of the necessary institutional framework to empower districts to improve their
plans, establish budgets and manage programs. According to a review by IEG, while key parts
of the project design were considered appropriate, the risk mitigation strategy vis-à-vis the risks
related to decentralized health care service delivery was considered “inadequate and overly
optimistic”. No systematic monitoring of project indicators has taken place making it difficult to
assess progress. In addition, some of the project components were cancelled. Nevertheless,
some project outputs were achieved, including training of health workers in Integrated
Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), reaching 55 of 77 districts through training, etc.
About 90 percent of users were satisfied with provision of health services by the end of the
project. The CAS planned the delivery of a health SWAp in FY06, which was postponed to
FY08 in the CAS PR and is now scheduled for FY10.
CAS Outcome: Increase access to basic health care [Not Achieved]
89.
The CAS used this as a separate CAS outcome, despite its strong relationship with the
previous outcome. As with the previous outcome, key indicators performed below the targets set
in the CAS. First, according to government data the percentage of children fully immunized
increased to only about 72 percent in 2006-07 (the CAS target was 85 percent). Second, births
attended by physician decreased from 44 percent in 2000 to 42 percent in 2006 (the CAS
targeted an unspecified increase in this indicator). However, spending in rural health services
did increase as percentage of the total health expenditures.

112

CAS Outcome: Enhance health procurement systems [Partially Achieved]
90.
There is some evidence of improvements in procurement and financial management at
the Ministry of Health. This was accompanied by the strengthening of the Kenya Medical
Supplies Agency which increased efficiency in the sector. This assessment does not include
AIDS-related products which are assessed below. The Bank contributed to both achievements.
However, as explained before, the overall procurement system is very weak as the Public
Procurement Authority is not yet fully operational and implementation of the existing law and
procedures is a major issue.
HIV/AIDS: Halt and Reduce Spread of HIV/AIDS
CAS Outcome: Prevalence of HIV/AIDS Falls [Achieved]
91.
Overall prevalence rates in Kenya are falling. The epidemic peaked in 1997-98 with an
overall HIV prevalence of around 10 percent in adults. The most recent data indicates that adult
prevalence has declined to about 5 percent in 2006, although the rates of infection are still almost
twice as high among women, especially the young compared to those of men. ARV therapy
increased from an estimated 24,000 in 2004 to an estimated 166,000 in 2007 in both the private
and public sectors. Governance in the sector has improved and the reputation of the national
institutions involved in the fight against AIDS has been enhanced and their programs are set to
achieve better results in the near future. There is still need to mainstream HIV/AIDS in
educational program.
92.
The Total War against AIDS (TOWA, 2007) aims to improve the institutional
performance of the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) and supports the implementation of
the Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP). It is showing some progress. Firstly, the
NACC “composite score” on the annual independent performance evaluation was assessed at a
fairly high level in 2006. The goal of TOWA is to maintain this level of capacity and, so far, it
has attained that goal. Secondly, the numbers of people undergoing testing and receiving
counseling is on track, having increased from 750,000 in May 2007 to over 814,000 in December
of the same year. It is supposed to reach 900,000 by 2010. Thirdly, HIV/AIDS and life skills
education curriculum has not been mainstreamed yet but efforts continued in this regard. In
order to sensitize the population, efforts by Ministry of Education and other organizations at
district level continued. Stigma is still high.
93.
The HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project (FY00-FY07) tried to “achieve, with the active
and broad participation of communities, the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS primary targets set out in
the Strategic National Plan". Despite several challenges with implementation, the project set the
stage for further progress under TOWA. NACC was completely restructured and transformed
from an institution plagued by fraud and corruption into one that is significantly more effective
and where management staff is now competitively hired under principles of skill-based
recruitment and selection. The perception of NACC by civil society organizations – who have
been the most vocal critics of mismanagement and fraud – has recently changed dramatically.
For example, in recent Global Fund negotiations, civil society suggested that “the new NACC”
should become the principle recipient of Global Fund grants. Recent work, led by NACC, to
mainstream HIV/AIDS in the Government budget cycle and the MTEF has increased the profile
for HIV/AIDS in core governance processes. The substantial improvement in the institutional
113

performance of the NACC has been confirmed by the annual performance evaluation which is
carried out by the Inspectorate of State Corporations. The significant improvement in NACC
governance and capacity over the past year (2005-06) is reflected in the NACC being attributed a
score of 2.4 (“very good”). This positive institutional impact was partly due to the active Bank
engagement and support working together with other donors. The management of stocks and
medical supplies continues to be very poor, resulting in losses (expiration, damages,
obsolescence) and higher than needed stocks in the districts.
Education: Achieve Universal Primary Education
CAS Outcome: Improve educational attainment [Achieved]
94.
There has been satisfactory progress on several indicators and significant Bank
contribution. The targets selected by the CAS were mostly surpassed, including an increase in
primary completion rates to 81 percent (above the 70 percent CAS target) and an impressive
increase in transition rates to secondary to currently 70 percent (above the CAS target of 50
percent). The CAS also aimed at a decrease of the primary repetition rate to 5 percent, but fell
slightly short of the target reaching 6 percent.
95.
The Free Primary Education Project (FY03-FY07) was squarely aligned with the CAS
framework. The main objective was to support implementation of the governments’ free primary
policy (see below). The focus on improving educational attainment was continued with the
Education Sector Support Program (FY07), which records improvements in learning
achievements. For instance, during 2005-06, mean scores of the national learning survey (in
English) increased from 42 to 46 percent; in Math from 47 to 54 percent and in Science from 51
to 53 percent. Local school management committees, parents and children increasingly rate their
school as satisfactory or above for the learning process. These outcomes capture the impact of
improvement in the pupil to textbook ratios. In 2003, the pupil-textbook ratio across Kenya was
highly uneven ranging from 5:1 to 40:1 (Standard 1); 4:1 to 25:1 (Standard 5) and 3:1 to 34:1
(Standard 8). By 2007, sharing rates improved in 90 percent of schools in the country with an
average pupil-textbook ratio of 3:1.
CAS Outcome: Increase access to education for the poor/Reduce regional disparities in
education [Partially Achieved]
96.
The introduction of free primary education resulted in a considerable increase in
education enrollments and access to education by the poor. However, regional disparities remain.
Free primary education was introduced before the CAS, in January 2003, effectively abolishing
primary school fees and levies charged to parents. National primary enrollment increased from
80 percent in 2003 to about 92 percent in 2007 (the CAS target was 85 percent) as children who
had previously dropped out or never attended school returned to the classrooms. However,
female enrollment still lacks behind overall enrollment rates (89 percent against an average of 92
percent). In addition, the CAS was aware of significant regional disparities and therefore aimed
at an increase in enrollment rates in the Northeast from 17 percent to 35 percent. All indications
are that, even though the CAS’s baseline indicator of 17 percent seems to have been too low
(according to UNDP enrollment was 26 percent in 2003), progress in the Northeast remained
disappointing with current total enrollment at only about 28 percent including only about 21
percent female enrollment.
114

CAS Outcome: Strengthen reporting mechanisms [Achieved]
97.
A 2006 Report by independent auditors/consultants on expenditure tracking concluded
that transfer of funds to schools did improve efficiency and ownership. In most cases, funds
received by schools have been correctly recorded and used for intended purposes, according to
the report. The report concluded that a large majority of the schools have put in place systems
that ensure transparency and value for money.
Delivery of CAS Program
98.
Delivery of the country program as envisaged by the CAS/CAS PR was unsatisfactory.
As demonstrated in Figure 10, the only time the lending program was exactly delivered as
planned was FY04, the year the CAS was written. The only other year the Bank program was
more or less in line with its strategy was in FY07 during the drafting of the CAS PR. Any other
year, the Bank’s program was under-delivered. In FY05-FY06 and FY08, the Bank’s program
delivered on average less than 50 percent of IDA commitments planned in the CAS/CAS PR.
The worst year was FY06 when the actual delivery of US$65 million, 70 percent below planned
commitments of US$205 million. In FY08, which was interrupted by the election crisis, the
program only delivered US$150 million instead of the US$397 million anticipated by the CAS
PR. As indicated above, project approval was subject to periodic interruptions associated with
negative events in the country, sometimes governance issues not related to any Bank-financed
project.

Annex 18 provides detail of planned versus actual deliveries. Delays in project delivery
have been common. The largest impact on fluctuations in commitments came from three
planned development policy operations. The FY05 Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit;
115

the FY06 Financial Sector Adjustment Credit and the FY07 Poverty Reduction Support Credit
all reached relatively advanced stages of design but have never been delivered. A major credit
for an Economic and Social Empowerment Program was planned for FY08, but ultimately was
split into three smaller projects, e.g. the Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children
Project delivered in FY09 and a Youth Empowerment program currently planned for FY10.
Many projects continued to slip, but nevertheless managed to stay within the pipeline for several
years. For example, the Health SWAp was first planned for delivery in FY05; it is currently
planned for FY11. Lake Victoria 2, a regional project with a large Kenya component, was
supposed to be delivered in FY06. It has finally been delivered in FY09. The Judicial
Performance Improvement TA originally planned for FY07 has been substantially delayed
awaiting results of the Constitution Reform process.
100. A similar picture of over-promising versus under-delivery emerges with regard to nonlending services. As Figure 11 shows, the Bank tended to plan more analytic and advisory
activities than it ultimately managed to deliver. However, in some years, additional non-lending
that was not originally planned in the CAS/CAS PR period was completed. The details are
provided in Annex 19. Assessing actual delivery is difficult in a large, highly active and
complex country program as Kenya. Many informal studies are being carried-out often funded
through trust funds and other channels outside the Bank’s budget. Some economic and sector
work is delivered as comprehensive “drafts”, but never formally finalized. There is no
conclusive evidence that the under-delivery of non-lending services have affected the quality
and/or design of projects, albeit they tend to impact in a much longer period.

Portfolio Performance
101. The Bank’s Kenya program ranked below the regions as well as the Bank-wide average
on outcomes rated satisfactory by IEG throughout the entire review period. Notwithstanding that
the number of projects rated by IEG is small. Paradoxically, the portfolio’s ratings with respect
116

to sustainability and institutional development impact remained above the regions’ and the Bankwide averages for most of the time except FY05.

102. There have been on average 2.7 problem projects during the CAS period. The highest
number of problem projects was 4, in FY06. Most projects faced problems with respect to
implementation performance. M&E issues improved somewhat during the CAS period
responding to concerted efforts. However, no specific measurement of outcomes was provided
while monitoring components in several projects. By FY04 only 9 percent of projects were
managed in the field. By FY09, a quarter of the projects were field managed.
