EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.

Country Context

Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1991, El Salvador has made substantial
progress in consolidating peace and democracy through three electoral cycles, the latest
presidential election having been peacefully conducted in March 2004. Despite the
country’s impressive record of reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies, growth
levels slowed in recent years due in large part to external shocks. The new government’s
plan “Safe Country 2004 – 2009” focuses on sound macro-management, foreign
investment promotion, free trade, private sector-led development and a business
environment free of exchange rate risk. The new government is also placing greater
emphasis on more inclusive growth and pro-poor policies, improving security and
reducing vulnerability.
ii.

The Bank Group Strategy

The Bank Group’s assistance over the four-year period covered by this CAS (FY05-08)
proposes a strategic program of lending and non-lending services to support the three
main pillars of the government’s development plan: (i) to accelerate broad-based,
equitable economic growth and increase employment; (ii) to improve equity through
building human capital and expanding access to socioeconomic infrastructure, assets and
markets; and (iii) to enhance security and reduce vulnerability. Bank Group assistance
will include: support for implementation of the existing loan portfolio; new IBRD
lending, including a Program of Development Policy Loans and investment operations in
selective areas which build upon prior successful implementation of innovative
operations in El Salvador; analytical and advisory work, technical assistance, and
capacity development programs; and targeted private sector assistance provided by IFC
and MIGA.
Support to Pillar I – The main support under this pillar would be a programmatic series
of Development Policy Loans (DPLs) and an investment operation to support small and
medium-size enterprise (SME) development. IFC would continue to support the
Salvadoran private sector enhancing the prospects for competitiveness and growth. Its
priorities will include: (i) continuing to assist in the development of the housing sector
via financing and technical assistance; (ii) helping to strengthen infrastructure (including
power); and (iii) supporting the MSME sector; (iv) promoting sustainable business
practices (including corporate governance, environmental and social management, and
corporate social responsibility programs). MIGA would support this pillar by facilitating
foreign investment.

Support for Pillar 2 - Main support under this pillar would be through the
implementation of ongoing operations and the development of two new investment
operations for land administration and education. IFC will help improve equity through
the on-lending instruments being provided for SMEs, thereby broadening their access to
financial markets.
Support for Pillar 3 - The Bank would provide support though ongoing investment
projects and three new investment operations for environmental services, social
protection and modernization of the State. IFC’s work on promoting sustainable business
practices will also help enhance both investor and citizen security in El Salvador.
The scale of Bank’s financial assistance would be determined by the Government’s
ability to maintain its high level of performance across the three pillars of the 2004-2009
Strategy. The base case could include up to $300 million in Development Policy
Lending and $185 in investment lending. To access increased lending levels,
performance will be assessed on progress toward objectives in strategic policy areas (See
Table 9). To move into a high case lending scenario, implying up to one additional $100
million DPL, would require performance on specific fiscal sustainability measures.
iii.

Managing Risks

Continued strong performance by the Government is subject to several sources of risk
including a deterioration in the external environment, the threat of natural disaster and
possible political gridlock. Moreover, El Salvador’s current debt burden, approaching 40
percent of GDP, increases its vulnerability to potential shocks. The CAS program aims
to manage risks through careful monitoring of progress, scaling fast disbursing lending to
policy performance momentum and focusing investment lending on areas which build on
El Salvador’s previous strong record of innovation, sustained impact and results. Should
El Salvador be subject to shocks arising from natural disasters or other external factors a
contingency scenario may be called for, which is not considered in this CAS. In that
case, the Bank team would develop an alternative program for discussion with the Board.
iv.

The following three issues are suggested for Board discussion

(i) Do Executive Directors agree that El Salvador is a good candidate for a series of
Programmatic Development Policy Loans as requested by the Government? (ii) Is the set
of proposed investment operations an appropriate and strategically selective complement
to the DPL series in light of El Salvador’s development priorities, support from other
development partners and the Bank’s comparative advantage? (iii) Do Executive
Directors endorse the proposed substantial increase in lending to El Salvador given the
country’s strong policy performance record, the current attention to improving fiscal
responsibility, and its continued low exposure to the Bank?

INTRODUCTION

1.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for El Salvador for FY02-FY04 was
discussed by the Board on November 2, 2001, together with an Earthquake Emergency
Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project to assist with the rebuilding of
critical damaged infrastructure following two powerful earthquakes in the first quarter of
the year. Appropriately, the primary focus of the government of El Salvador (GOES) in
2001 was to support the reconstruction of the economy within the framework of its longterm development objectives, and this priority was reflected in the Bank’s assistance
strategy for the country. Over the past 2-3 years, however, considerable progress has
been made in addressing the losses and setbacks to the economy wrought by the
earthquakes, and attention has shifted squarely to the longer-term development
challenges facing El Salvador. In this context, the recently-elected Saca administration,
which took office in June 2004, requested that the Bank prepare a new CAS in support of
its core development strategy “Safe Country 2004-2009”. As a consequence, this CAS is
focused on supporting the three main pillars of the government’s strategy as follows: (i)
accelerating broad-based economic growth and increasing employment; (ii) improving
equity through building human capital and enhancing access to basic socioeconomic
infrastructure and markets; and (iii) enhancing security and reducing vulnerability.
II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
2.
Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1991, following a 12 year civil war, El
Salvador has made substantial progress in consolidating peace and democracy through
three electoral cycles, the latest presidential election having been peacefully conducted in
March 2004. On the economic front, El Salvador has been a regional leader in economic
reforms. Starting in the early 1990s, successive governments have tackled reforms in a
host of key areas including trade liberalization, tax reform, strengthening of the financial
sector, and promotion of private participation in telecoms, energy, and pensions. More
recently, a decision to dollarize the economy in 2001 has resulted in lower inflation and
interest rates and reduced business uncertainty. Since the early 1990s, the country has
also invested in schooling, health and other basic services, which, together with the
economic reforms, have contributed to rising per capita incomes and a notable reduction
in poverty. As a result of this wide-ranging, deep and sustained reform effort since the
early 1990s, El Salvador stands out as one of the leaders in reforms in LAC. This is
clearly reflected in the Index of Economic Freedom which places El Salvador in 2004 as
24th in a field of 155, second among LAC countries (behind Chile).

3.
The re-establishment of peace and the country’s sustained economic reform
efforts have yielded substantial gains for the population since the early 1990s. Economic
growth in the 1990s rebounded to an average annual rate of 4.9% --the second highest in
Central America behind Costa Rica -- after a decade of poor performance during the
1980s. Impressive progress was also made in social areas, including in basic education
enrollment, infant and maternal mortality, access to reproductive health services and
access to safe water. Gains in social indicators reflect not only the fruits of economic
growth but increasing public sector attention in these areas, including important reforms
and increased budgetary allocations. Remittances from family members working abroad
have also helped some families emerge out of poverty. The combined impact of
economic growth, human development improvements and the cushion provided to some
families by remittances has been a marked decline in poverty. Overall poverty declined
significantly (over 27 percentage points) between 1991 and 2002, while extreme poverty
was halved in the same period.
4.
El Salvador has posted important gains toward meeting most of the Millennium
Development Growth targets since 1990 (see Table 1). The extreme poverty target had
been met by 2002 and the child mortality target is likely to be achieved before 2015.
Projections of school enrollment rates also indicate that El Salvador will be able to
achieve universal primary education by 2015. Gender differences in enrollment rates are
virtually nonexistent. However, child malnutrition rates remain of concern, and trends in
maternal health do not display an unambiguous improvement. While the target for access
to water seem likely to be met, recent trends are not encouraging with respect to
achieving the target for halting forest degradation.
5.
Despite the country’s impressive record of reforms and prudent macroeconomic
policies, growth levels have slowed down since the second half of the 1990s. The slow
down has been in large attributable in large measure to external shocks – both the
massive destruction caused by the 2001 earthquakes and unfavorable external economic
developments. El Salvador’s terms of trade deteriorated in the 1996-2000 period at a rate
of about 4 percent per year on average and the recession in the U.S. affected the demand
for Salvadoran exports in 2000-2001, severely affecting the country’s large maquila
sector in particular. The significant decline in the world price of coffee has adversely
affected parts of the rural economy since about 2000. More recently, the Salvadoran
economy has been negatively affected by the rise in oil prices. As a result of these
factors, growth since 2000 has averaged only 2.0%, barely enough to keep per capita
incomes roughly constant.

III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND KEY CHALLENGES
A. Political Context
6.
On March 2004, El Salvador conducted its third presidential election since the
signing of the Peace Agreements in 1991. The election took place with the full
participation of all political forces, including the former guerrilla movement, which has
transformed itself into a legal party, Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional
(FMLN). The 38-year-old entrepreneur, Antonio Saca, representing the National
Republic Alliance (ARENA) defeated his nearest rival with a solid margin of 57.7% to
35.7%, and took office on June 1. The new President has assumed office with
considerable legitimacy, since he was elected with a record turnout of around 60%.
7.
The political party ARENA has maintained control of the executive branch of
government ever since signing of Peace Agreements but in the 1997 congressional
elections it lost its absolute majority in the legislature. In 2000, ARENA lost its position
as the largest party in Congress and several of the most important municipal
governments to the FMLN. Currently in the 84-member Legislative Assembly the
FMLN holds 31 seats, ARENA has 29, the Partido de Conciliación Nacional (PCN) has
14, and the Centro Democrático Unido (CDU) and Partido Demócrata Cristiano (PDC)
hold 5 each. The political evolution of El Salvador, and the resulting division of power
between the FMLN and ARENA, have increased transaction costs for the Executive
Branch, introducing some degree of uncertainty and slowing down the reform process.
On the positive side, the fact that, since the 1991 Peace Agreements, El Salvador has
been able to conduct municipal and congressional elections with full transparency,
legitimacy, and participation of all political parties, indicates robust progress in the
process of democratic consolidation.
8.
President Saca’s administration is perceived, nationally and internationally, as a
guarantor of continued commitment to the market-friendly policies and reforms promoted
since 1991. The Plan “Safe Country 2004 – 2009” adopted during the campaign by
President Saca, and summarized in Figure 1 below, focuses on sound macromanagement, foreign investment promotion, free trade, private sector-led development
and a business environment free of exchange rate risk. However, the new government is
placing greater emphasis on more inclusive growth and pro-poor policies and assigning
higher priority to policy consensus with the opposition in the legislature and consultation
with the private sector and civil society. The government also views improving security
as a key pillar in its development plan. The vision of a “Safe Country” encompasses a
broad definition of security, including improving physical safety through programs to
combat and prevent crime and violence, increasing investor security through initiatives to
combat corruption, increase transparency and impartial enforcement of the law and
building greater public confidence in public institutions, including the judiciary. The
government is also committed to reducing vulnerability, giving priority to enhanced
social protection and safety net programs for the poorest and most vulnerable households.

PROMOTING PARTICIPATION AND CONSENSUS

PARTNERSHIPS WITH SALVADORANS ABROAD

9.
The work ahead for the government will be challenging as a result of the slow
down in economic growth and social progress over the last few years, persistent crime
and violence (See Box 1) and the uncertain political environment. The majority of the
population expects improvements in the quality of their lives and better access to market
opportunities and the election period witnessed some dissatisfaction with key institutions
and a degree of reform fatigue. There are some policy or substantive issues where
consensus may prove challenging to accomplish such as healthcare reform, privatization,

5

in particular with respect to energy1, and in the area of public finances. Avoiding
legislative delays and developing a national agenda goes beyond the Executive Branch
and is one of the biggest challenges for the government, requiring positive support from
political opposition, private sector and civil society at large. President Saca has created a
Presidential Commission for promoting consensus on critical issues – e.g.,
decentralization, tax reform, health reform, and others to be negotiated -- that require
national long term commitment and support across party lines. This has already proved
possible in the areas of education and tackling crime and violence, for example. The
Comisión Nacional de Desarrollo (CND)2 will play a key role in building consensus for
the adoption of a national vision and agenda for development.
1

According to opinion surveys conducted by Latino Barometro, in 1998 El Salvador was the third country, out of a group of 17, with
the strongest support for privatization but by 2001 support had dropped down dramatically, placing the country in the tenth place out
of the same group of countries. In 1998, almost 53% of the population expressed support for privatizations but in 2001 support had
been reduced to 25%.
2
The CND was created during the Administration of President Calderon Sol, and succeeded in presenting a concrete set of
recommendations that were going to be supported by an ambitious four year investment plan during the period 2000-04. CND
contribution however was reduced by the polarization of public opinion, the breakdown in dialogue that followed dollarization and
the impact of the earthquakes.

6

BOX 1: VIOLENCE AND CRIME: A CRITICAL CROSS SECTORAL ISSUE
Violence in El Salvador is a critical issue, with significant economic, social welfare, health, and governance
impacts. Homicides, crime, youth gang (Maras) violence, and domestic assault are widespread and high:
seven people are killed every day; the homicide rate, at 45 per hundred thousand, is among the highest in
LAC; 90% of Salvadorians feel generally unsafe, and 25% report feeling insecure even when at home.
Maras are estimated at 20,000 members, and 150 out of 262 municipalities report active youth gangs in
their jurisdictions1.
The persistently high levels of in crime and violence has negatively affected the image of the country and the
investment climate: a recent survey finds that firms consider it the number one constraint for business
operations and investment. Crime and violence in El Salvador also undermines social capital and erodes the
assets and incomes of the poor, for example by devaluing property values in insecure neighborhoods , impeding
safe access to education (when gangs take over schools) and reducing employment opportunities, particularly at
night, because of the dangers of public transportation.
After much internal debate, consensus is emerging on how to tackle the complex social, economic, and
political nature of violence and crime in El Salvador, while preserving human rights and civil liberties. The
government of President Saca has adopted an integrated strategy (Plan Pais Seguro) that includes:
•

Improvements in the Criminal Justice System: This component focuses on deterrence and control of
violence through a more effective process of arrest, conviction, and punishment. Activities include: a
zero-tolerance campaign against crime and violence (Plan Super Mano Dura)2, support for the Judicial
Branch’s process of modernization; strengthening of the National Public Security Council (CNSP) and
its violence prevention programs; strengthening and modernization of the national police in areas such
as crime control and violence prevention ICT system, investigation capacity, training; drug and
alcohol control and anti-money laundering systems, penal system reform.
• Promoting Growth and Employment Creation: crime and violence are partly the result of social and
economic conditions (close to 75% of youth gang members are chronically unemployed). Thus, GOES
policies to promote growth , together with improvement of infrastructure and services, creation of
local employment and income opportunities, construction of new decentralized training centers and
strengthening labor training will contribute to the reduction of crime and violence.
• Building social capital to prevent crime and violence: including working with families, communities,
and municipalities in the participatory identification of needs of communities affected by violence;
improved coverage and quality of education and health services; promoting home ownership;
developing a more reliable safety net; providing parks and recreation to low-income barrios; promoting
a culture of conflict resolution and curriculum adaptation in schools, together with a referral program
for “at risk” youth, and enhanced teacher security.
• Local and National Dialogue and Consensus Building: Sustainable peace and development are
unlikely without open debate among all actors about the causes as well as the solutions to violence.
Participatory processes can also identify local-level solutions to rebuild social capital and citizenship
and to address the needs of priority target groups. Important contributions to this effort are expected
from the recently created “National Commission on Governance”, the National Council on Public
Security, the Comisión Nacional de Desarrollo plus, at the local level, municipalities.
• Creating partnerships for the prevention of crime and violence, including corporate social
responsibility initiatives to improve local services and community infrastructure in areas with high
incidence of crime and violence and support for programs to generate youth employment for
rehabilitated gang members . The “Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Publica” is coordinating initiatives
implemented by government, municipalities, private sector, NGO’s, UNICEF, UNDP) and the donor
community.

B. Economic Performance

10.
Macro Economic Performance. Since the end of the civil war in 1992, El
Salvador has generally maintained a solid track record of macroeconomic policy and
structural reform. This record has been characterized by low inflation rates, low fiscal
deficits and stable debt levels. In recognition of this record, El Salvador has obtained stable
and low-cost access to external financing since the late 1990s, maintaining high credit
ratings. In October 2004, El Salvador, along with Chile and Mexico were the only
countries in Latin America to boast investment grade ratings by Moody’s.

After almost a decade of keeping an unchanged level of the exchange rate vis-àvis the dollar, Salvadorans took the important step of making the dollar legal tender in
2001, a decision which recognized the growing ties of the Salvadoran economy with the
United States. The decision also reflected some frustration with domestic interest rate
levels, which continued to reflect a sizable exchange rate premium, despite a proven
record of solid macro management and ample international reserve holdings. With

8

dollarization, inflation rates have converged to international levels, and interest rates have
dropped to reflect world interest rates plus a country premium. Exports have continued
to grow under the new regime, thanks to a flexible labor market and efforts to boost
competitiveness, despite depressed external demand and adverse terms of trade. In
addition, reduced transaction costs from dollarization have facilitated financial flows, a
phenomenon that has strengthened the regional standing of El Salvador’s financial sector
and explains growing cross border lending.
12.
El Salvador’s fiscal accounts have shown some deterioration since 2000, as a
result of reconstruction investments needed to reestablish infrastructure damaged with the
2001 earthquakes, as well as the need to absorb some of the transitional costs of the
pension reform of 1996. Consequently, El Salvador’s non-financial public sector deficits
have risen since 2000, peaking at 4.4 percent of GDP in 2002. Due to El Salvador’s good
standing as a sovereign debtor in international markets, much of the fiscal burden has
been financed at moderate cost, although at the expense of a rise of about 10 percentage
points in NFPS debt in the period 2000-2003, reaching 40.7 percent of GDP by end
2003.
13.
On the external side, El Salvador has seen some growth of the current account
deficit since 2002, financed mainly by strong inflows of private lending -- through
international bond issues and increased lending from commercial banks and other private
sources – as well as FDI flows. Since most of the recent increase can be explained by the
need to finance greater fiscal deficits, the shortfall in the current account can be expected
to narrow gradually as the new government carries out its fiscal plans. On the other hand,
the large trade imbalance of recent years (about 15% of GDP in 2003), financed by the
significant flow of remittances from Salvadorans living abroad (see Box 2), is likely to
persist into the future. Remittances have exhibited a secular increase since the 1980s and
have proven insensitive to cycles in the U.S. economy.

9

BOX 2: REMITTANCES IN THE SALVADORAN ECONOMY
Large migration flows associated with the intensification of the civil war in the early 1980s, are responsible
for the steady growth of remittances which has become the largest source of foreign exchange for the
economy of El Salvador. Remittances have increased from an average of 2.6 percent of GDP during the
1980s to 14 percent in 2003. In contrast to other flows of foreign exchange, remittances do not generate
undesirable indebtedness cycles and have proven to be remarkably stable. The persistence of these flows,
despite the downturn in economic activity in the U.S. in 2001-02, served to cushion the economic shocks
that affected El Salvador, including the decline in coffee prices.
The aggregate impact of remittances on the Salvadoran economy has been very significant. In
macroeconomic terms, they are the principal source of financing for the growing trade imbalance of recent
years, which has risen from less than 7 percent of GDP during the 1980s to 15 percent in 2003. An
injection of resources of this magnitude would normally be expected to cause significant macroeconomic
effects, including a real exchange rate appreciation and a decline in exports. However, studies have
confirmed that El Salvador has managed to maintain its external competitiveness and a healthy export
performance, due to a relatively flexible labor market (The World Bank, 2004, CEM).
Remittances reach directly about 14 percent of Salvadoran households, who use about 70 percent of their
value to meet consumption needs. Household data suggests that the majority of the direct recipients have
been households in the middle and upper deciles, as migration costs and barriers are daunting for the
poorest. However, the importance of these flows in total income is highest for the poor. Remittances have
become a critical source of income and an important safety net for many Salvadoran families that are
subject to swings in incomes.
While remittance flows already exert a strong impact on the Salvadoran economy, creative policies and
initiatives could improve their development impact. Senders and recipients should be encouraged to open
and use bank accounts, to reduce costs, minimize risks and gain access to credit. Governments can establish
incentives to formalize remittance flows and to encourage their use for investment, including for the
creation of small enterprises. Hometown associations, working together with local and central
governments, and the private sector can play a useful role in aggregating flows to make significant
investments in local infrastructure and other public goods.

14.
El Salvador medium-term outlook. Looking towards the future, there is a
pressing need to address the recent build up in public debt as El Salvador continues to be
vulnerable to shocks that may require fiscal reaction space (e.g., natural disasters,
commodity prices, international recession). The new Saca Administration has made
containment of the recent run up in debt levels a top priority. The medium-term plan is
designed to lower the deficit and reduce overall debt levels, which are targeted to decline
to about 39.2% of GDP by the end of the presidential term (2009) (see Table 3).3 The
plan includes significant fiscal adjustment, as the government aims to reduce debt while
at the same time absorbing the growing costs of pension reform and creating space for
additional growth and social expenditures.
15.
In keeping with its track record of prudent macroeconomic planning and
acknowledging that vulnerabilities to external shocks still remain, the government’s plan
is based on conservative projections of 3 percent GDP growth during the period 20052009. These projections are an improvement over the average rate of the period 19962004 of 2.5 percent, but still low by historical and regional norms. In particular, the
Bank’s recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) predicted that without negative
3

In 2004 total public sector debt is estimated at 44.8 percent of GDP. The difference with the NFPS figures
presented in Table 3 is accounted by outstanding net debt of the Central Bank and other public banks.

10

exogenous shocks, continued implementation of reforms should yield annual growth rates
in excess of 4.0 percent. The government hopes that its proposed fiscal plan will allow it
to gradually increase public investment levels in growth-inducing expenditures over the
medium term, with emphasis on human capital and infrastructure.
16.
While higher growth should facilitate continued progress in poverty reduction
efforts in El Salvador, it is unlikely to be enough. The new government plan also
recognizes that some of the poorest Salvadorans have been unable to take advantage of
economic growth over the past decade and a half and require special efforts in terms of
improved targeting and additional resources in social programs. To build effectively on
past achievements, the government has proposed to implement a social policy aimed at
improving access to basic services and developing a safety net for the poorest and most
vulnerable households. Despite difficult fiscal constraints, the government plans to
increase social spending gradually over the next five years. The efficiency and targeting
of social expenditures should also improve as the government proceeds with its program
of social sector reforms, particularly in health and water.

17.
The Saca administration has moved speedily with reforms in the fiscal front in
its brief time in office. In June 2004, it obtained legal backing for the elimination of early
retirement provisions in the pension law (estimated annual savings of about 0.2% of GDP
– see Box 3). It also presented a prudent 2005 budget, which includes a freeze on public
sector wages and an overall expenditure level consistent with a planned deficit for 2005
of 3% of GDP. In late 2004, the administration obtained legislative approval of a package
of fiscal reforms, centered on reducing loopholes, improving tax collection powers and
raising excise taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and arms. The package is estimated by the
government to yield some 1.2% of GDP in 2005. In addition, the government has
announced its intention to pursue further fiscal reforms if necessary in order to gradually
raise tax revenues to a target 15.2% of GDP by 2009.

BOX 3: FISCAL COST OF PENSION REFORM.
El Salvador adopted a pension reform in 1996 that replaced the existing pay-as-you-go system with a
system of individual retirement accounts. The reform was aimed at improving long-term fiscal
sustainability by replacing a system that was projected to yield large and growing deficits in the future by a
sustainable one, implying transitional costs as younger Salvadorans move to the private account system
while the state keeps the obligation to pay out pensions to older generations. In addition the reform made
the conditions for access to benefits more homogenous among workers from the private, and public
sectors, and aimed to gradually increase coverage and develop a private savings pool that could form the
basis for long term investments.
Managing the transition costs of the pension reform is currently an important challenge in El Salvador,
particularly as the country also needs to finance other important social expenditures. The government has
adopted several measures to manage these costs, the most important of which was the approval in June
2004 of the elimination of early retirement provisions. This measure should reduce the fiscal costs of the
pension system by about 1 percent of GDP over the next five years (2005-2009).

18.
Financial Sector. El Salvador made impressive progress in strengthening its
financial sector in the 1990s with the introduction of new legislation, and consolidation of
the banking sector following intense mergers and acquisitions in the latter part of the
decade. Development of the banking sector has benefited from free capital flows and low
inflation, and the effect of dollarization. In 2000, at the request of the government, the
IMF and World Bank carried out a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) to assess the
stability and performance of the financial sector as a whole. In 2004, they conducted an
Update of the FSAP (a summary of findings and recommendations appears in Box 4) to
assess progress since 2000 which found that while the country enjoys one of the region’s
stronger financial sectors, considerable scope exists for tightening prudential standards
and reducing contingent liabilities4. Capital adequacy requirements need to be raised to
meet international standards. In addition, direct contingent liabilities arise from the
operation of three public banks for which a new financing structure needs to be
developed in which the fiscal cost of this public lending activity is fully and transparently
4

According to the latest IMF Article IV consultations under an adverse scenario the equivalent of 4.5% of
GDP of contingent liabilities could become an explicit public liability.

funded by existing fiscal resources. Challenges in the development of capital markets are
discussed below under the section on the growth agenda.
19.
As part of El Salvador´s efforts to strengthen its financial sector, a strong AntiMoney Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime are also important both
in the public and the private sector. Measures on these fronts would deepen the efforts to
combat corruption and to foster transparency, which reduces the vulnerability to money
laundering and terrorism financing.

Main Findings
El Salvador has made progress clarifying the roles of the Banco Central de Reserva (BCR) and the
Superintendencia del Sistema Financiero following dollarization in 2001.
Dollarization has had a positive impact on financial sector stability by mitigating exchange rate
risk, lowering interest rates, and diminishing the costs of borrowing from abroad. Indicators on
bank soundness suggest that the system weathered the economic downturn quite well.
Regulation and supervision of the financial system has been strengthened since 2000, notably in
the framework for weak bank resolution and in issuing regulations to combat money laundering.
Cross-border lending has increased rapidly in the past few years, and generally appropriate
supervisory guidelines have been put in place.
Under dollarization, the BCR acts as fiscal agent for the government issuing Treasury securities
to smooth out cash-flow for government financing. The BCR continues to issue its own paper to
manage the stock of international reserves, because it does not have sufficient government paper
for this purpose.
The BCR holds the liquidity reserves of individual banks, but it has no commitment to act as
lender-of-last-resort, except as an agent of the government in weak bank resolution.
El Salvador provides a more friendly environment towards micro lending than most Latin
American economies.
Corporate credit could benefit from improvements in registration of pledges and execution of
claims, diversifying security methods, completing the reform of registries for real estate and
immovable assets, and reducing the complexity of judicial enforcement proceedings for execution
of both unsecured and secured claims.
Main Recommendations
Tighter loan classification and stricter provision is required to improve further the soundness of
individual banks.
Stronger capacity to conduct consolidated supervision is needed to keep pace with the growth of
cross-border banking activity .
The BCR needs to replace central bank paper with Treasury bills and capitalize government
deposits in order to build up official reserves to cushion systemic liquidity.
Approval of the new Securization Law is required to further stimulate access to credit and to
allow for the efficient allocation of credit risk among borrowers, first and second floor financial
intermediaries, and investors.
Legislation on corporate insolvency should be reviewed to facilitate the reorganization of viable
enterprises and/or the liquidation of non-viable ones. The environment for informal corporate
restructuring agreements also needs to be improved.

13

C. Governance
20.
El Salvador is implementing a successful process of public sector modernization,
streamlining and improving efficiency of key areas of the state. Reforms were started in
1994 and were strengthened in 1999 in order to improve service delivery, address the
overextension and centralization of the State, as well as reform outdated and inadequate
administrative infrastructures. Important accomplishments in this area include: (i) the
successful restructuring of the Ministry of Public Works, transforming it into a policy
ministry and spinning off the maintenance activities to the public sector, with significant
efficiency gains; (ii) development of a human resources management system for the
public sector including the design of tools for selection, evaluation, classification,
remuneration and promotion of government employees; (iii) issuance and implementation
of modern financial management, procurement, tax, and customs legislation and the
introduction of integrated financial management and tax information systems; and
(iv) partial decentralization of public services in water and health.
21.
Despite significant progress in this area, further efforts to modernize the public
sector and strengthen governance are still required to improve the efficiency and
transparency of public institutions and address public perceptions. Continued efforts at
institutional restructuring in other Ministries, such as Agriculture, are being planned and
should provide continued momentum towards increasing efficiency and effectiveness of
public institutions. Furthermore, decentralization efforts are still incipient and should be
framed within a comprehensive strategy, and certain key legal reforms—such as a new
Civil Service Law—are still necessary. The country is also exploring the potential of
electronic government initiatives to bring efficiency gains and to improve the access to
certain services.
22.
The low credibility of the impartiality and efficient functioning of judicial
systems is also a major issue. Corruption and lack of transparency in the operations of
some public sector agencies are also often cited as problems. (Transparency International
ranks El Salvador 51 out of 145, and fifth in LAC after Chile, Barbados, Uruguay and
Costa Rica.) According to the Worldwide Governance Research Indicators Dataset,5
when compared to the Latin America and the Caribbean average, El Salvador does well
in preserving political stability, is around the average in terms of its regulatory
framework and promotion of voice and accountability, but shows less than average
performance in rule of law, government effectiveness and control of corruption.
23.
As regards the financial and procurement reform process, significant
improvements in the performance of budget and procurement management institutions
have been made. To document the current state of public financial management in the
country and propose priorities for action, the World Bank and the IADB carried out in
2004 a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and a Country
Procurement Assessment (CPAR). The key findings and recommendations are
summarized in Box 5.
5
The Governance Indicators, compiled by the World Bank Institute, reflect the statistical compilation of responses on the quality of
governance given by a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries, as
reported by a number of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations.

14

BOX 5: CFAA AND CPAR - SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment Report (CFAA) and the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR), prepared jointly with the IADB, analyze the performance and transparency of
budget and procurement management institutions and systems in the public sector. The analysis and
recommendations contained in these reports seek to identify areas where further improvements in public
financial management could help to strengthen fiscal discipline, increase operational efficiency, and
improve the country’s governance environment.
The analysis concludes that the Government has built strong foundations for well-functioning budget and
procurement management systems, with a basis on modern legislation. Still, the widening public sector
deficit and deteriorating governance indicators pose important challenges ahead. Accordingly, a detailed set
of recommendations has been put forward to the Government – a brief summary follows:












Civil service. Further strengthening of the financial and procurement management institutions will
benefit from the implementation of the government’s plans for a renovated legal and regulatory
framework for human resource management and increased managerial accountability.
Budget development. The sound methodologies used for budget formulation could serve as basis
to improve disclosure of extra-budgetary funds, to aggregate and consolidate municipal budget data, to
develop a medium term budget framework, to enhance information and indicators on the public
investment program, and to bring the budget documentation up to international standards.
Tax administration. The modern revenue administration systems could benefit from stronger
coordination among the agencies involved, together with enhancements in the prosecution and
sanctioning of tax and customs-related cases.
Procurement management. The significant steps taken with the creation of a central regulatory
body (UNAC) and decentralized procurement units (UACIs) can be better sustained through systematic
staff training and technical assistance, issuance of regulations to the procurement law, and harmonization
of bidding and contract documents.
Budget execution. The integrated financial management system (SAFI) has significantly
improved the procedures and information on government spending, but there is still work ahead to
develop or consolidate related administrative systems; most notably, the upgrading of the payroll
management system, and the development of a comprehensive procurement information system (under
the e-Government initiative), coupled with tools to monitor procurement performance.
Debt. Active debt management will require the introduction of continuing programs for skills
development in this highly specialized area – such programs to include the capacity to undertake
systematic debt sustainability and risk analyses.
Internal controls. Implementation of a more effective internal control and internal audit
framework, based upon risk-based approaches, will be key to further guarantee efficiency and legality of
public expenditures.
Financial reporting and external oversight. The accounting function, which is properly
institutionalized and shows sophisticated advances, could serve as basis for further improvements in the
content and accessibility of financial information. Comprehensive financial and procurement audits from
the Court of Accounts, together with strengthened legislative oversight, would help fill current gaps in
external fiscal control.

Noteworthy recent steps in the public financial management area have been the government adoption of a
framework for internal controls consistent with international standards and the issuance of a four year
program for the public procurement system.

24.
The new government of El Salvador is committed to addressing the governance
challenges by strengthening anti-corruption and transparency initiatives, improving
personal security through development of programs for the control and prevention of
crime and violence, and undertaking further modernization and institution building in the
overall public sector. The government is also considering initiatives to continue

15

strengthening the regulatory frameworks, institutions and public-private contracting
protocols that involve the provision of basic services (such as electricity,
telecommunications, urban transport services and water). Although significant progress
has been made in certain sectors, these initiatives will help the government to consolidate
the benefits of the privatization process begun in the 1990s and thus improve the quality
of life of its citizens and the competitiveness of its businesses.
25.
An important component of the governance challenge—to which the government
has also committed itself—is to improve the capacity of the judicial system to properly
enforce legislation by strengthening management, adopting a more effective
organizational structure and improving the allocation of resources.
D. The Growth Agenda
26.
During the 1990s, few countries experienced as much progress as El Salvador in
the introduction of first generation reforms, creating a solid market-oriented framework.
However, growth levels have been disappointing since the second half of the 1990s.
While factors beyond the control of the authorities explain a large share of this result
(e.g., commodity prices, natural disasters), there are still some key weaknesses in policies
and institutions that need to be addressed. According to the Bank’s recent Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), which evaluated positively El Salvador’s reform agenda
of recent years, key priority areas to reignite growth include (i) further expanding
international trade, (ii) improving the investment climate, (iii) addressing remaining
bottlenecks in infrastructure, (iv) fostering innovation and adoption of new technology
and, (v) increasing the educational level of the population. This section presents an
overview of challenges in the first four of these items, with education issues discussed at
more length below in the section on human capital.
27.
Trade. El Salvador and four other Central American countries have negotiated a
free trade agreement (DR-CAFTA) with the United States. If implemented, the
agreement is expected to bolster trade and investment levels. The Bank’s recent
analytical work in this area indicates that DR-CAFTA could add at least 0.5% per annum
to El Salvador’s growth rate. The agreement would yield opportunities to turnaround the
recent deceleration in export growth, which has been affected by greater competition
from Asian textiles in external markets as well as low prices for coffee and other
traditional exports. It is also expected to improve significantly the investment climate, as
it contains rules and disciplines for investment relations, anti-corruption, as well as labor
and environmental standards. Commitments in these areas are expected to yield
improvement in key regulations, as well as a strengthening of local institutions. Greater
trade opportunities and a stronger investment climate are expected to boost investment
levels, both from abroad and from internal sources, which is the linchpin of the
government’s plan to reignite growth. The agreement was ratified by the Salvadoran
Assembly in late 2004 and is expected to enter into force as soon as it is approved by the
U.S. Congress in 2005.
DR-CAFTA is likely to enhance market access for some Salvadoran products,
28.
while making permanent the unilateral preferences offered in the past through the

16

Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Little if any trade diversion is expected, since the U.S.
has been traditionally the largest natural market for Salvadoran exports, as well as its
largest source of imports.

Education and knowledge absorption and generation: DR-CAFTA is likely to bolster FDI and imports with
the capacity to improve technology and productivity. However, to materialize the potential and enhance
technological spillovers will require sufficient levels of human capital and an adequate knowledge and innovation
system. In education, this means that El Salvador needs to close its ‘gap in skills’, expanding coverage and quality
of its primary and secondary schooling system. In the innovation front, it will need to boost the quality of its
institutions of research, increase expenditures on R&D and develop links between public researchers and private
sector users. There are important synergies to be exploited between a functioning innovation system and critical
higher education initiatives.
Institutional development and governance: El Salvador has achieved considerable progress in the institutional
and governance front over the past decade. However, serious deficiencies still exist, particularly in the rule of law
and personal security front, as evidenced by corruption, violence and crime indicators. Weaknesses in rule of law
are part of the reason for the apparent low growth yield of reforms in El Salvador in recent years. To reap the
rewards of DR-CAFTA, continued improvement in institutions is required, especially those aimed to improve the
rule of law and fight corruption. This will require substantial local efforts, as such improvements have not been
automatic byproducts of North-South free trade agreements.
Infrastructure: While El Salvador has made great strides in modernizing its infrastructure (esp. airports and
roads) in recent years, there are deficiencies that need to be addressed, particularly in road networks and ports.
The experience of Mexico has shown that the southern provinces have lagged behind the rest of the country in
taking advantage of the growth opportunities offered by NAFTA, principally because of low education levels, and
weak transport and communications infrastructure. To allow all regions of El Salvador to benefit from DRCAFTA, strategic investments in infrastructure will be required, with increased emphasis on lagging regions.
Macroeconomic management: Investors should be attracted by El Salvador’s record of stable macroeconomic
management of recent years. Potential fiscal losses associated with DR-CAFTA will need to be compensated and
macroeconomic management strengthened. Within the dollarization framework, the Central Bank’s role as lender
of last resort to the financial system needs to be bolstered and efforts must be redoubled to ensure compliance
with strict prudential norms and regulations. Further fiscal consolidation will also be required in order to pursue
effective counter cyclical policies.
Trade policy: In addition to strengthening institutions related to meeting DR-CAFTA commitments in the trade
administration sphere, El Salvador is likely to benefit from continuing to pursue its agenda of unilateral, bilateral
and multilateral actions to expand trade and broader integration opportunities. Deepening trade and other links
with regional neighbors through the CACM will improve allocation of resources in the region and provide
economies of scale needed to launch new viable export ventures. Further progress in reaching FTAs with Canada,
the European Union and with other Latin American countries through FTAA will further broaden economic
integration and minimize any possible trade diversion effects from existing FTAs.
Broadening the benefits of DR-CAFTA: Attention is also required to ensure that benefits of DR-CAFTA are
spread across all levels of Salvadoran society. This includes policies to foster development of financial services
beyond large companies, so that MSMEs have access to finance. This is likely to require legal and institutional
shortcomings regarding the protection of creditor and shareholder rights. Specially targeted programs for low
income farmers/laborers may also be needed for those who are likely to be displaced from their current activities,
to facilitate a smooth transition to other areas with more growth potential.

Complementary actions will be required to ensure that El Salvador takes full
advantage of the opportunities offered by DR-CAFTA, and to obtain the anticipated
boost in growth rates, as indicated in the Bank’s recent analytical work on this topic (see
Box 6). Actions will be especially needed in improving the investment climate,
addressing critical infrastructural bottlenecks, fostering innovation and raising the

17

educational level of the labor force. Complementary actions are also needed to ensure
that the opportunities of trade are accessible to small and medium size firms, which
represent a significant percentage of El Salvador’s economy.
30.
El Salvador has also advanced in the reduction of institutional barriers to trade in
the region by working with partners of the Central American Common Market (CACM)
on the terms for creating a customs union. In recent months, Guatemala and El Salvador
have been unifying their border customs offices and are advancing on plans to share
revenues in order to eliminate customs posts in common borders.
31.
Investment Climate. In this area, issues that need to be addressed include the
poor functioning of some markets, insufficient competition in others, high costs of doing
business and further development of capital markets, as described below.
32.
Market performance and regulation of competition. One of El Salvador’s key
deficiencies in international competitiveness rankings is the persistence of perceptions of
anti-competitive practices in some markets as well as the lack of modern anti-trust and
bankruptcy laws. The appropriate functioning of some markets has been impaired by
weak enforcement of current norms and the absence of a modern Commercial Code.
Market performance is also affected by gaps in the overall regulatory framework and
weaknesses in some regulatory agencies. Improvements in the effectiveness of the
judicial system is also needed.
33.
Costs of doing business. Recent reports by the Bank have highlighted the high
costs of doing business in El Salvador. In particular, local entrepreneurs still have to
endure long and costly processes to establish a new business. Recently, the National
Investment Office (ONI) reduced the time to register a foreign business form 8 months to
2 weeks. However the benefits of administrative simplification for starting and operating
a business need to be extended to local firms, including SMEs. According to the 2005
Cost of Doing Business Report, El Salvador needs additional efforts in reducing the
number of days and the cost of registering new firms.
34.
Development of capital markets: El Salvador’s capital market has benefited from
a regionally strong financial sector, generally effective legislation, banking consolidation,
unrestricted capital flows and considerable integration of micro-lending institutions to the
formal banking sector. However, the banking sector’s ability to provide capital to all
types of productive activities is constrained by its limited capacity to assume undiversifiable risks, and by the need to permanently maintain high precautionary liquidity
levels. Alternative financing instruments could develop through the securitization of
claims on selected investment projects, as banks, brokerage houses, and the Stock
Exchange offer the infrastructure required to place those securities in their primary
market, and to provide liquidity to them by maintaining an active secondary market.
Other areas that require further efforts to improve access to finance more broadly include
improving credit analysis for micro lending institutions; introducing more flexible
guarantees and more efficient registration of related pledges and execution of claims.

18

35.
Infrastructure. Despite progress during the 1990s, and a major reconstruction
effort after the 2001 earthquakes, El Salvador still faces challenges in the coverage,
quality, access and sustainability of infrastructure services. To move in this front, the
country needs to mobilize additional investment resources (public and private) and
continue institutional and policy reforms. In particular, the country needs to improve the
framework for efficient and equitable provision of infrastructure services, strengthening
the institutional capacity of the “Superintendencia General de Electricidad y
Telecomunicaciones” (SIGET) and issuing complementary legislation particularly in the
energy, telecommunications, water and sanitation, and transport sectors. In addition, as
the DR-CAFTA approaches implementation, improved access to market will be a key
requirement for the benefits of the treaty to materialize, for which resolution of
bottlenecks in road, aviation and port policies will be necessary.
36.
In energy, an electricity sector reform program begun in 1996 unbundled the
national utility and, in 1998, privatized distribution and generation assets. The
privatization program led to investments of approximately US$850 million in the sector.
This has significantly increased coverage and service quality, resulting in a decline in the
production losses experienced by Salvadoran firms as a result of power interruptions.
However, further regulatory and market structural reforms are needed to ensure
competitive behavior and pricing as well as an investment program that keeps pace with
demand.
37.
In telecommunications, the situation has improved significantly over the past few
years, as the liberalization of the telecom market has led to impressive expansion of
coverage for telephony and a drop in rates. Nonetheless, El Salvador’s technological
competitiveness is impacted by the low level of reliance on information and
communications technology illustrated by an unusually low use of the internet. This is
likely due to tariff structures that price internet usage out of the market for homes and
small businesses. Regulatory and institutional strengthening in this area could help El
Salvador to leverage its wide telephony coverage as a basis for more competitive ICT.
38.
In water and sanitation, the sector presents a mixed picture in regulation and
supervision, and the country is lagging behind neighboring countries in the region, some
of them with much lower per capita income, in terms of access to improved water
sources. Many agencies from the public sector have jurisdiction over the water sector,
resulting in inefficiencies, poor accountability, and lack of a comprehensive policy
framework. The situation and performance of the water and sanitation sector has impacts
that not only affect public health but reduce the country competitiveness, increasing the
cost of doing business and its capacity to attract foreign investments.
39.
Through the creation of the road fund (FOVIAL), El Salvador has made
significant strides in rebuilding its primary and secondary road network since the 2001
earthquakes. However, it still maintains the lowest level of paved roads in Central
America—26 percent. Among those roads less than 60 percent are in good or very good
condition. In a survey conducted in 2002 as part of the Investment Climate Assessment,
approximately 40% of firms reported losses or damage of goods in transport from plants
to consumers. Inefficiencies in the transport and logistics chain generate losses equivalent

19

to 1.8 percent of total sales. Going forward, the country needs to improve—through both
public and private investments—critical roads for international and interregional
commerce, including the East and North Corridors, as well as the unpaved rural road
network that connects rural areas to the primary roads.
40.
One out of every three firms in El Salvador found air transport to be a bottleneck
for export competitiveness and FDI. Private investment and a modern management
arrangement are also needed to improve cargo services at the Comalapa International
Airport. In ports, the national seaport, Acajutla, remains a relatively inefficient public
terminal with limited container capacity while most shippers seeks access through
Honduras. While the government is considering the development of a new port facility
with support from Japan, the port reform program has been highlighted in
competitiveness studies as a priority for exporters and other shippers and consignees. In
all cases, it is clear that actions should go beyond physical infrastructure and deal with
the entire logistics chain that increases cost and reduces the capacity to export and the
attractiveness of El Salvador for private investment.
41.
Innovation and technology. El Salvador is trailing in the area of innovation and
technology, as diagnosed in the Bank’s recent CEM. The country is lagging in its efforts
to develop an effective National Innovation System (NIS). By international standards, El
Salvador underperforms in innovation outcomes (e.g., patents, scientific publications) as
a result of a very low level of R&D investment in comparison to countries of similar size
and level of development, despite evidence of high potential rates of return to this type of
investment. In addition, the efficiency of the NIS system, measured as the productivity of
turning R&D investments into patents, is low in comparison to similar countries. This
inefficiency is in great part due to the lack of collaboration between the private sector and
research organizations such as universities. El Salvador also performs poorly in
international comparisons of technology transfer through FDI.
42.
Improving its NIS and levels innovation and technology transfer remains an
important challenge in El Salvador going forward. The CEM suggested the following
initiatives to improve El Salvador’s NIS: (i) improve the capacity of El Salvador to fully
benefit from the available stock of knowledge, by emphasizing imports of capital goods
and licensing; (ii) enhance the incentive-regime for private R&D to help technology
absorption and support gradual technology adaptation; (iii) strengthen public-private
partnerships particularly (although not only) in key areas of the economy such as
agriculture and teleservices; and (iv) improve coordination, policy-making and
effectiveness of public interventions.
E. Poverty
43.
El Salvador has made significant progress in reducing poverty since the beginning
of the 1990s. The share of the population whose income falls below the poverty line
declined by 27 percentage points from 64.4 percent in 1991 to 37.2 percent in 2002,
while the fraction living in extreme poverty declined by almost 16 percentage points from
31.2 percent to 15.4 percent during the period. Poverty fell fastest in the first half of the
decade and slowed considerably after 2000 – in the face of the coffee crisis, the
20

earthquakes of 2001, and the slowdowns in the global and domestic economies. Indeed,
extreme poverty has barely changed since 2000. Moreover, income inequality, already
high by international standards, has increased slightly since the mid-1990s, highlighting
the challenges facing El Salvador’s poorest families.
44.
Several factors are associated with the broad improvements in poverty during the
1990s. Economic growth has been an important force for poverty reduction, and many
poor families were able to share in the growth that occurred over the period. Between
1991-2002 period, for example, average incomes of the poor households grew by 3.1
percent a year, not far from the nationwide average of 3.7 percent. Structural changes in
employment and household earnings have also contributed to poverty reduction over the
period.
Specifically, there was a considerable movement of employment and
diversification of household incomes out of agriculture over the period, and those
households that were able find new, non-agricultural income sources, generally
succeeded in raising their living standards over the period.
45.
In addition, remittances played an important role in poverty reduction over the
period. Indeed, households that received remittances had income levels that were fifty
percent higher than otherwise identical households that did not. Only a relatively small
proportion of the poor received remittances during the period, however; as such,
simulation analysis suggests that the effect of households’ own income growth was likely
greater than the effect of remittances in reducing poverty. Finally, increased attention to
the social sectors, which has tended to be low by international standards, has contributed
significantly to increased access by the poor to human services. This, in turn, has
contributed to increased economic productivity among young graduates and paved a way
toward further reductions in poverty in the future.
46.
Although there has been some narrowing of income differentials across
departments since the early 1990s, regional and spatial dimensions of poverty remain
important. Moreover, recent estimates indicate that poverty in El Salvador continues to
be disproportionately a rural phenomenon. According to the recent World Bank Poverty
Assessment (2004), roughly half of Salvadorians living in rural areas was poor and a
quarter of the rural population was extremely poor in 2002. This compares with about 29
percent of urban population which was poor, and only 9 percent who were extremely
poor. While according to official figures only about 40 percent of Salvadorans live in
rural areas, 55 percent of all poor people lived in rural areas in 2002 (Box 7). Extreme
poverty is particularly concentrated in rural areas; in 2002, nearly two-thirds of all El
Salvador’s extreme poor lived in rural areas. Along other social dimensions, it is worth
noting that there has also been some closing of the gender gap in well-being over time.
While, on average, female headed households were significantly poorer than male-headed
households in 1991, this was no longer true by 2002.

21

BOX 7: POVERTY REDUCTION AND THE RURAL-URBAN DIVIDE
To date, poverty analysis in El Salvador has utilized official definitions of rural and urban, which are based
on long-standing administrative boundaries. Nonetheless, there is some debate in the development
literature as to whether historical administrative definitions are the most appropriate. One alternative
definition, used by the European Union and applied to Latin American countries in a new World Bank
Flagship report “Beyond the City: The Rural Contribution in Development in Latin America and the
Caribbean”, defines rural communities in terms of their population density and distance from major urban
centers. Under this definition, the spatial distribution of the Salvadoran population – and, thus, the regional
characterization of poverty in El Salvador – would differ notably. Only 10 percent of the total Salvadoran
population would be is characterized as rural, and much of what policymakers now call rural might be
characterized as “semi-urban”.
While it is possible to debate the merits of this alternative definition for El Salvador, one potential benefit
of this definition is that it serves to highlight rural-urban linkages that will be increasingly important for
future poverty reduction in El Salvador. The increasing importance of non-agricultural incomes is already
clear from the analysis presented in the Poverty Assessment. Indeed, a key engine for poverty reduction
over the last decade has been the structural change of the overall economy toward manufacturing and
services and the important diversification of incomes among “rural” (and/or semi-urban) households into
non-agricultural activities. This structural movement out of agricultural into non-agricultural enterprises
and income is likely to be a major force in poverty reduction in El Salvador in the coming years.
This analysis reinforces several strategic areas of policy reform and investment highlighted in the Poverty
Assessment that will be important to reducing poverty in the future. This includes investments in human
capital of the poor to enable them to better take advantage of emerging economic opportunities, and
investments in rural road and transport infrastructure to strengthen linkages to markets and between the
agricultural and non-agricultural economies.

47.
El Salvador’s recent successes in reducing poverty have highlighted a new set of
challenges for continuing poverty reduction and social progress in the years to come.
Economic growth will continue to be a central feature in El Salvador’s efforts to reduce
poverty. As such, one key challenge will involve reinvigorating economic growth. A
second, and equally important challenge, will be ensuring that the poorest Salvadorans
are able to benefit from future economic progress. This is important because while the
more moderate (or “relative”) poor did benefit from economic growth since the early
1990s, the poorest, most vulnerable Salvadorans have not been able to take advantage of
recent progress. Indeed, while the moderate poor experienced average household income
growth of over 3 percent per annum, per capita incomes of the poorest Salvadorans grew
only 1.3 percent per year, on average, over the period. This, in turn, has fueled the recent
increases in inequality in El Salvador, and raised the prospect of the poorest segment of
Salvadoran society being further left behind in the future. The recent World Bank
Poverty Assessment for El Salvador (2004) finds that inability of the poorest to take
advantage of economic progress is related both to the weak human capital endowments of
the poorest, most vulnerable Salvadorans, as well as their continued lack of access to
markets and basic services. These factors help to frame the main policy areas for future
poverty reduction in El Salvador.
48.
Environmental degradation has increased El Salvador’s vulnerability to natural
disasters (earthquakes, floods, etc) and is closely related to rural poverty. Low

22

productivity in production systems and pressures from the population have led to a
depletion of natural resources in many rural areas, characterized by soil erosion and
degradation, loss of habitat, biodiversity and natural forests, and growing problems in
water management and conservation. In order to address these vulnerabilities the new
government is developing a national environmental policy and strategy, with broad
citizen participation, that would consolidate the regulatory and legal framework and
support implementation of measures aimed at watershed recovery, reforestation,
decontamination, clean production, management of ecosystems and biodiversity
conservation. The government is also considering piloting a system of charges and
payments for environmental services that would compensate poor hillside farmers for
adopting sustainable agricultural practices and producing positive environmental
externalities. This type of program has been successful in reducing rural poverty in a
sustainable way in countries such as Costa Rica.
F. Human Capital and Socio-Economic Infrastructure
49.
Education. Continuing to strengthen the education sector will be central to El
Salvador’s economic growth and poverty reduction strategies. El Salvador has a strong
history of education reforms and a good track record of cost-effective use of resources. El
Salvador's education system made positive strides in the 1990s and is now very well
positioned in the Central American context. In particular, El Salvador has made
considerable progress in raising primary enrollment rates (primary gross enrollment rate
over 100% and primary net enrollment rate of about 85%), primary graduation rates
(now about 80%) and secondary coverage (gross enrollment rate of about 60%).
Additionally, the urban-rural and socio-economic gaps have decreased. It is likely that
the country will meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goals for net primary
enrollment, share of students that complete the fifth grade, and the universal literacy
target for youth. The targets related to gender in primary and secondary education as
well as literacy rates have already been met.
50.
This performance is the result of a comprehensive education reform which started
in the early 1990s and was formally endorsed by the ten year Education plan (1995-2005)
which received broad-based support from Salvadoran society. The education reform
included several innovative measures, such as: (a) the re-organization of the education
cycle into a basic (grades 1 to 9) and a secondary (grade 10 to 11 or 12) sub-cycle; (b) the
introduction of a pioneering community-based school management model, called
EDUCO, in the rural areas; (b) full teacher certification; (c) the introduction of teachers’
selection and accreditation mechanisms and of a team-based merit pay scheme; and (d),
more recently, the introduction of multi-grade teaching and distance education in rural
areas.
51.
Despite these recent achievements challenges remain, particularly with respect to
equity, quality, and efficiency. The still-low education indicators--such as standardized
assessments and pre-school and secondary education coverage--affect especially students
from low income families. Secondary enrollment rates are only about 20 percent among
the poor (compared with about 50 percent among the non-poor) and, when the poor do
enroll in school, they are less likely to continue to completion (less than 10% of the poor

23

complete secondary). In addition, while the quality of education is a system-wide
challenge in El Salvador, education quality appears to be particularly low in schools
attended by the poor. There is a need to increase the value of additional years of
education at the lower secondary level where rates of return are very low and improve the
relevance of upper secondary education. Therefore the GOES is seeking not only to
continue increasing access to secondary education but also to improve its quality and
modernize its content. In terms of efficiency, the system needs to find more costeffective strategies to strengthen and/or expand successful innovations such as
community-based education management, multi-grade schooling, distance education,
education for overage students, technology centers and extra-curricular programs for
youth. Efficiency gains will guarantee better use of proposed additional resources to the
sector.
52.
Public education spending in El Salvador is still low compared to international
standards and to the regional average. Spending is also low relative to El Salvador’s per
capita income level. The new government of El Salvador has placed education at the
centre of its development strategy and is fully committed to supporting educational
reform. A new fifteen year Long Term Education Plan with specific preschool, primary
and secondary education targets to 2021 - is being prepared using the same national
dialogue and consensus process as before; and, in parallel, the government will
implement the key activities of the 2004-2009 Education Development Program. The
government will focus on key areas, which include improving education quality,
providing access for all for secondary education (including poor and rural populations),
strengthening secondary education linkages to productivity and technology, and
increasing public (and overall) financing for education. Quality improvements will be
supported by a strengthened testing and evaluation system. Wider access to secondary
will be supported by the consolidation of distance education and demand-side programs,
as well as by innovations such as the development of rural school networks. The link with
technology will be strengthened by the creation of regional technological poles.
53.
Health. Continuing to improve Salvadorans’ access to healthcare and, through it,
their health status, will also be a critical dimension of increasing the human development
and well-being of all Salvadorans. During the 1990s El Salvador made progress in life
expectancy, infant mortality rates and child immunization. These indicators are now
similar or slightly better than LAC, and gaps between the poor and non-poor have closed,
at least in some areas. However, the prevalence of chronic child malnutrition has
declined more slowly, and basic health and nutrition indicators continue to be
significantly lower among the poor than the non-poor. The prevalence of child mortality
is fifty two percent higher in rural areas than in urban areas and infant mortality is almost
twice as high for low-income families. Fewer than 20 percent of all Salvadorans have
access to medical insurance either through the Salvadoran Social Security Institute or
through private sources. Less than 10 percent and 3 percent of the moderate and extreme
poor, respectively, are insured. Therefore, a major responsibility of El Salvador’s
Ministry of Public Health (MOH) is to cover the population without insurance. While
there have been significant advances in recent years, it is estimated that nearly onequarter of the population, mostly the poor, still has limited or no access to public health

24

services. Problems of access have been exacerbated by delays in repairing earthquake
damage to hospitals and other health facilities.
54.
Continuing to improve basic health outcomes among the poor will require
enhanced efforts to ensure access to affordable healthcare among those who lack it, as
well as building greater trust in the public health care system through improving the
quality of services. This will involve: (i) ensuring that targeted health fee waivers are
available, when necessary, to address demand-side constraints among the poor; (ii)
assessing ongoing institutional reform and decentralization efforts, streamlining the
stewardship and management roles of MOH and SIBASIS6 respectively, as well as
expanding social security coverage on health; (iii) identifying cost-effective ways of
strengthen the outreach and quality of the public health system, particularly at the
primary level, and tapping the potential of NGOs and other private providers of health
services for the benefit of the poor; (iv) reforming the health sector’s human resource
policy to ensure a sufficient supply of well-trained health care professionals and quality
care, particularly in poor rural areas; and (iv) completing rehabilitation of hospitals
damaged by the 2001 earthquakes to ensure safe and adequate supply of secondary and
tertiary health services, as well as rationalizing and modernizing the public hospital
infrastructure.
55.
El Salvador’s overall budgetary allocation for health services as a share of GDP is
low by regional standards, as are total public outlays (including health programs of the
Social Security Institute) on a per capita basis. In contrast to education, there is still no
broad consensus on the direction of health sector reforms. The current government has
reestablished the political dialogue with health stakeholders and revived the National
Commission on Health Reform, after a severe deterioration of the dialogue process
during the past few years. A critical element in making sustainable progress in health will
be building a national consensus on the way forward in important issues such as progress
in the decentralization of public services; public-private partnerships; expansion of health
insurance and cooperation between social security and MOH; staffing levels, recruitment
and payment policies to health personnel; and enhancement and enforcement of quality
and safety of care. Efforts should focus on how to improve the efficiency and equity of
resource use, as the government identifies new sources of additional funds to allocate to
the sector. Reforms that define a strategic direction, including the appropriate roles for
the private as well as the public sector, could pave the way to significant efficiency gains,
and thus a greater leveraging of available resources.
56.
Socio-economic Infrastructure. Access to basic services and to markets is key
to expanding the productivity and income and employment generating opportunities of
the poor. Over the 1990s, El Salvador made significant progress in increasing access to
safe water, sanitary installations, telecoms, and electricity. Important gains were also
made in reducing the isolation of poor, rural households and enhancing their access to
markets through investments in expansion and improvement of the rural road network.
6

SIBASIS (Sistemas Básicos de Salud Integral): Decentralized autonomous networks of MOH facilities
providing primary and secondary care to defined geographical areas under unified management.

25

Average distances and travel times to paved roads and to markets declined substantially
for all rural households, and most dramatically for the poorest families.
57.
El Salvador has already surpassed the MDG target for urban water and sanitation
and rural sanitation coverage and it is likely that by 2015, the target for rural access to
water will be met. However, about half the poorest households still lack access to safe
water, particularly in rural areas, and pollution has proven to be a serious health threat for
consumers. In addition, over 20 percent of the poorest households lack adequate
sanitation facilities. The current regulatory system allows for decentralized water
provision but provides uneven “rules of the game” across water sector institutions leading
to inefficiencies, considerable variability in the quality of water systems, and at times
high water costs to the poor who access water through gray market purchases. The sector
also suffers from institutional weakness and dispersion: Many agencies from the public
sector have jurisdiction over the water sector: the Ministry of Agriculture operates and
administers the national irrigation system, the Ministry of Public Health monitors the
quality of water for human consumption and industrial production, and the
Administracion Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (ANDA) operates and
regulates water and sewage.
58.
Reforms were initiated in the 1990’s but set aside because the focus shifted to
system reconstruction in the aftermath of the earthquakes. The government has not
completed development of a comprehensive policy framework for the water sector,
mainly due to fragmentation in the management and control over its many segments.
However, technical preparations for a reform of the sector are advanced, with ANDA
drafting legislation to open up the market to competition by 2004 and establish a
regulatory entity to oversee national water policy. Despite concerns about the capacity of
ANDA to lead the reform process the new government is potentially in a strong position
to finalize the technical inputs and complete reforms. This could vastly improve access
to potable water among the poor.
59.
Improved coverage and quality of rural roads during the 1990s has contributed
to poverty reduction in rural areas, and has given household members access to markets,
educational and health centers, water and security. However, the poor still face greater
distances and costs associated with accessing services or markets. Average distances to
paved roads are still 80-90 percent higher among the extreme poor than the non-poor in
rural areas, and average distances to the nearest market are roughly one-third higher
among the extreme poor than the non-poor. The government is committed to continue
investing in rural roads and is focusing on: (i) expanding and improving the rural road
network; (ii) developing a program for the maintenance of secondary and tertiary road
networks to ensure sustainability of investments in roads and (iii) continuing
development of local and municipal capacity to build and maintain rural road
infrastructure.
60.
Significant improvements have also been made in coverage and quality of
electricity service since 1990 particularly in rural areas. The proportion of households in
rural areas with electricity increased by 28 percentage points between 1991 and 2002.
However, in 2002 almost 29 percent of rural households still did not have electricity.

26

Strengthening the electricity sector is part of the President’s plan “Safe Country”.
Specific challenges include: continuing to increase coverage in rural areas; the reduction
of electricity costs through more efficient generation and distribution, and the
improvement of service quality. The sector could benefit from more targeted resource
allocation priorities: subsidies should be reduced for those who already have access to
electricity to allow more resources to be allocated for the benefit of low-income
populations and rural areas lacking service.
61.
Government priorities in poverty reduction. A key priority of the Saca
administration is to address the needs of the poorest Salvadorans who have been unable
to take advantage of economic growth over the past decade and a half and who have not,
as yet, been able to benefit from traditional sector programs. To build effectively on past
achievements, the government has proposed to implement a social policy, based on broad
national consensus, aimed at expanding access to markets and basic services, including
the coverage and quality of education and health care for the poor, and developing a
social safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable Salvadorian families. While
improving targeting and the efficiency of public resources are also important, the
relatively small size of overall expenditures in these areas indicate the need for additional
investment, which will imply difficult trade offs in an environment with extremely tight
fiscal limits. The government’s medium term plan gives high priority to social
expenditures and aims to gradually increase social spending as a percentage of GDP over
the next five years.
IV. EVALUATION OF COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FY02-04
62.
The World Bank’s Board of Directors discussed the last CAS on November 2,
2001, covering the final three years of the Flores administration. The CAS supported
three interrelated development objectives: (i) sustaining efforts to reduce poverty and
promoting social development; (ii) accelerating growth and developing new
opportunities; and (iii) fine tuning the role of the public sector. It proposed lending of
US$270 million over FY02-04, with a base case of five planned operations: Earthquake
Emergency and Basic Health Care Extension (FY02, $145 million), Judicial Reform
(FY02, $10 million), Rural Productivity (FY03, $25 million), Environmental Services
(FY04, $10 million), and Land Administration II (FY04, $30 million). The high case
proposed an additional US$50 million, including further support for Education Reform
and the Social Investment and Local Development Fund. Analytical and advisory
services (A&A) were also proposed, including a Poverty Diagnostic, a Decentralization
Study, a Social Protection Review, a Country Economic Memorandum, a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment and a Country Procurement Assessment Report and
follow-up support to a recent Financial Sector Assessment.
63.
Country Program Performance Indicators. Table 4 lays out the indicators
developed in the last CAS for measuring Country Program Performance, with significant
progress in some areas, while others are lagging. As discussed earlier, growth rates
slowed in the last few years, due largely to external shocks. As a result per capita growth
rates were lower than planned. However, the targets for the share of households in
poverty and in extreme poverty were already met by end 2002. All targets in education
27

have been met or exceeded, including the increase in net primary enrollment rate,
achievement of gender parity in primary enrollments, and rehabilitation of schools
damaged by the earthquakes. However, the declines in the rates of infant mortality and
malnutrition were lower than expected, and there was little progress in reconstruction of
hospitals. The design for the Modernization Plan for the Supreme Court was completed
in 2002. Some important measures were taken to improve the investment climate: the
time to register a foreign business was reduced from 8 months to 2 weeks, the export
matching grant mechanism was successfully launched, and a fuel tax was introduced to
finance road maintenance. Concessions of the airport, ports and mail service were not
approved, due to the slow-down in reforms as a result of increased political polarization
in the latter part of the Flores administration; however, modernization of the airport and
ports remain on the agenda of the new government.

64.
Only two of the five planned projects were delivered during FY02-04: the
Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction and Basic Services for US$192.6 million and
Judicial Modernization for US$18.2 million. This was largely because some of the
projects were postponed by the government as it faced severe fiscal constraints in the
aftermath of the earthquakes. However project preparation for Land Administration II,
Education Reform II, Environmental Services and Social Protection advanced and these
operations are included this CAS. Table 5 presents the current IBRD portfolio. The
Bank’s current lending portfolio in El Salvador includes six projects totaling US$380.8
million net of cancellation, of which US$190 million has been disbursed as of December
31, 2004.

IBRD Lending. Overall the results of the Bank’s ongoing portfolio in El
Salvador has been satisfactory, although project implementation has generally been rather
slow and operations have taken longer than expected to disburse fully (See Table 5). Box
8 presents the findings by OED on projects which closed over the last seven years.

30

BOX 8: KEY LESSONS ON PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION FROM OPERATIONS EVALUATION
DEPARTMENT (OED)
The World Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) conducted Implementation Completion
Report Reviews for 4 projects which closed between 1998 and 2004: Agriculture Sector Reform and
Investment Project, Energy Sector Modernization, Basic Education, and Power Sector Technical Assistance
Loan. OED rated the outcome of these projects as “satisfactory” in three cases, and “moderately
satisfactory” for the Agriculture Sector Reform and Investment Project. Key lessons include: (i)
institutional reforms are more successful when there is unwavering commitment from the government for a
sustained period of time and reforms are done incrementally and in sequence; (ii) dialoguing with key
stakeholders and gaining consensus on reforms is a critical element to successful implementation of sector
reforms; (iii) there may be advantages in packaging institutional reforms and sectoral investments as
separate operations to avoid complexity and overloading implementation capacity; and (iv) it is important
for smooth project implementation to set up the project executing unit well before loan effectiveness and
have it staffed with senior professionals with adequate experience in technical, administrative and legal
matters.

66.
In key areas of Bank support, El Salvador has been a regional leader, and has
successfully piloted innovative approaches that have subsequently been adopted
elsewhere. For example the Land Administration project is considered a best practice in
the region and throughout the world and has provided an example for a series of similar
Land Administration projects in Central America. The Competitiveness Enhancement
Technical Assistance Project which closed in June 2004 had great success in supporting
the government’s program to accelerate private sector development and raise
productivity. It was the first of its kind in the LAC region, and its lessons are now
reflected in similar projects in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, as well as in other
LAC countries. The Bank has been a major supporter of El Salvador’s education sector
over the years, and a key partner in the design and implementation of the highly
successful EDUCO community-based education program. The EDUCO model is
considered a global best practice and was showcased at the Global Forum on Poverty
Reduction in Shanghai in April 2004. The Bank-supported Public Sector Modernization
project was instrumental in pushing forward very important structural reforms in the
public sector. The new CAS will build on these successful programs.
67.
The two new projects approved during FY02-04 suffered from significant delays
in getting Congressional approval and took virtually two years to become effective.
During this time, the Health project has evolved in a more strategic direction and the
MOH is now using the project as an opportunity to rationalize and modernize the hospital
network. The current objective is not only to restore hospital services to their preearthquakes levels, but to make the rehabilitated hospitals more responsive to new
demands for expanded basic services, reduce unnecessary hospitalization, implement
more efficient modalities of hospital care and introduce modern management policies and
systems. With support from the project the MOH has developed a Hospital Master Plan.
The MOH has carried out the technical and administrative preparatory work necessary to
use faster construction modalities (turn-key and design-build modalities). An assessment
of availability of medical equipment is underway, as well as development of construction
and equipment standards and environmental assessments. A top priority is a MOH
reorganization to strengthen management of public hospitals by setting up decentralized

31

autonomous units and implementation of performance-based service agreements and
territorial health plans. The MOH has also strengthened its technical capacity and toolkit
to contract and monitor health services. The package of health services has been refined,
its costs updated, NGOs providing health services in remote areas have been assessed,
innovative reimbursement mechanisms have been defined, technical standards for the
delivery of care have been developed, and monitoring indicators and guidelines
produced.
68.
Despite the delay in effectiveness of the Judicial Modernization Project, there has
been some progress in three key areas: (i) a modernization plan for the judiciary has been
completed; (ii) administrative streamlining at the central level is well advanced and
regional administration coordinators have been established; and (iii) a citizen information
center and a judicial document center has been set up in San Salvador and training needs
assessments have been completed.
69.
Non-Lending Services. Throughout the CAS period the Bank maintained an
effective partnership with El Salvador through non-lending services, including Economic
and Sector Work, advisory services, conferences and workshops, technical assistance as
well as grants for studies and capacity building. In the last two years, the Bank
completed five core diagnostic studies: a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), a
Poverty Assessment, a Public Expenditure Review, a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA); and a Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR). The CFAA and
the CPAR were both completed as joint documents with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). Other major AAA activities include follow up to the FSAP
through technical assistance and capacity building to the Central Bank; the preparation of
an education strategy paper; and a study on Disaster Loss Exposure and the Viability of
Using Insurance or Catastrophe Bond Instruments for Financial Protection Following
Natural Disasters. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) worked with the
government and other key stakeholders in an assessment of labor and environmental
standards in key export industries in order to strengthen corporate social responsibility
programs through strategic collaboration between the private and the public sector. FIAS
also assisted in the implementation of an education-focused Corporate Social
Responsibility Strategy.
70.
In a number of areas the Bank’s program of AAA services has helped to build
consensus among key stakeholders and to shape the direction of national policies and
priorities. For example, the El Salvador Poverty Assessment is part of an ongoing
program developed by the Bank in response to a request from the government for
assistance in the aftermath of the earthquakes. The first phase included: (i) analysis of
poverty in El Salvador and policy advice on how to improve the impact of social policy
and social sector spending; and (ii) analysis of vulnerable groups and of existing
programs to confront vulnerability, and recommendations on how to strengthen the
country’s social safety net. The analytical work was accompanied by technical assistance
to the statistical agency DIGESTYC to enable analysis of the municipal-level poverty
impacts of the earthquakes. The work culminated with the delivery of two policy notes –
Poverty and Social Expenditures and Elements to Strengthen the Social Safety Net - and
follow-up discussions with the Economic and Social Cabinets. The first phase provided

32

an important foundation and generated demand for further analysis and dialogue aimed at
strengthening the impact of El Salvador’s poverty and social sector policies and
programs.
71.
The second phase of the program was produced in response to a specific request
from GOES for more in-depth analysis in selected areas, including: (i) an update of the
poverty profile with special emphasis on the impact of the earthquakes; (ii) a detailed
analysis of social sector spending and its impact on the poor – including spending on
rural water and roads, as well as on education, health, and social protection; and (iii) an
examination of the likely fiscal costs of achieving further poverty reduction and socioeconomic progress. The Poverty Assessment team also provided technical assistance and
guidance including: (i) support to DIGESTYC as part of broader GOES efforts to
construct a municipal-level poverty map and (ii) support to a multi-stakeholder exercise
undertaken by the GOES on progress and challenges related to the MDGs.
72.
In education, the Bank has carried out analytical work and provided technical
assistance to help prepare a comprehensive diagnostic of the sector and define strategic
priorities. The Bank recently finalized and disseminated a policy note on the education
sector. The Bank also provided support to a multi-stakeholder and multi-donor exercise,
led by the Ministry of Education, to produce an integrated diagnostic of the education
sector in El Salvador. This diagnostic combines the findings of various local and
international organizations in all major areas of the education sector. The Bank helped in
all key steps of the process by: (i) providing its own diagnostic of the sector; (ii) helping
with the organization of workshops to share the findings/studies of the different
organizations; (iii) providing technical assistance for the integration of the studies; and
(iv) supporting a final workshop to validate the results of the integrated diagnostic.
73.
During the CAS period 02-04, more than 350 representatives from Salvadoran
government agencies, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector
participated in World Bank Institute courses, conferences, Global Distance Learning
Network dialogues, and other learning programs. Programs in El Salvador included
courses on education reform, urban management, health sector reform and environmental
management. WBI also organized together with FUSADES a regional conference on
knowledge and innovation strategies.
74.
International Finance Corporation (IFC). IFC’s strategy as outlined in the
previous CAS was to continue to work with the private sector in support of its recovery
and medium term growth, with focus on investments in the country and regional financial
and physical infrastructure. Special focus was given to, and opportunities explored, in
the financial markets, infrastructure and agribusiness sectors with projects materializing
during this period in the first two sectors.
75.
Although the private sector in El Salvador still faces many challenges, the
investment climate was generally perceived as positive over the last CAS period--owing
to reform progress made to date. Reflecting this perception in part, during this period
IFC provided a total of $229.5 million (including $75 million for participations) for 6
projects in El Salvador. The investments were made in diverse sectors, such as financial

33

market, infrastructure (power), and retail. In FY04, new commitment activity reached a
record high at $92.5 million (in four projects). As a result of this activity, as of endFY04, the committed portfolio (of IFC’s own account) stood at $170 million, more than
three times the end-FY01 level.
76.
During the previous CAS
period, IFC continued to be very

fund support, IFC has been undertaking a study covering El Salvador, Costa Rica, and
Panama (where there is a developing primary mortgage market and some secondary
mortgage market activity) with the aim to develop a regional platform for creating the
primary mortgage market which would subsequently help establish a regional secondary
mortgage market. IFC also supported broadening smaller businesses’ access to finance
with investments in Banco Agricola and Calpia (or currently known as Banco
ProCredit). Furthermore, with an equity investment in AFP Confia, one of the leading
pension fund administrators, IFC supported the private pension system in El Salvador.
This was IFC’s second investment in the sector where the Corporation provided advice to
the government on the private pension law in the past.
Table 6: IFC Commitments in FY02-04

77.
As part of Central American regional projects, IFC also supported TUCA (Trans
Union Central America), the first private credit bureau that would operate throughout
Central America, with an equity investment. The support for private credit bureaus is
expected to facilitate the extension of credit to previously underserved segments of the
population, in particular small businesses. IFC also provided Banco Cuscatlán de El
Salvador with a subordinated convertible loan to be treated as Tier II capital, as part of
$40 million financing package to the Cuscatlán group. Additionally IFC supported with
an investment Aureos CA Fund, a private equity fund that acquires minority interests in
medium-sized Central American enterprises that would provide appropriate shareholder
rights and would pursue a regional integration strategy.
78.
IFC’s largest investment during this period, including participants, took place in
the infrastructure sector. IFC provided a $110 million loan (including $75 million from
participants) for CAESS and EEO, power distribution companies to finance their capital
expenditure program.
79.
Finally, IFC also supported the wholesale and retail sector with a long term loan
to Metrocentro for the first-phase construction of a multi-purpose complex, which would
first develop a shopping mall and later offices, a residential complex, a park, and a hotel.
In addition to the rarely available long-term financing, IFC also assisted the company

34

with technical assistance in enhancing the business skills of its micro and small business
tenants (funded by a donor support and the Corporate Citizenship Facility).
80.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). MIGA began its
technical assistance work with El Salvador in late 1999 providing input on the design of
PROESA, the national investment promotion agency. From its initial work on the
structure and staffing of the agency to the sophisticated promotional systems that have
generated important FDI flows for the country, MIGA has been very involved with
PROESA. This long term program has achieved substantial results including hundreds of
projects that have contributed to employment generation. Moreover new sectors,
particularly business process outsourcing, have begun to invest in El Salvador. MIGA has
provided technical support including: staff training in promotion techniques, campaign
planning and execution, sector selection, and assistance in the creation of a public
relations campaign, the role of the Board of Directors, the creation of an aftercare
program for existing investors, and many more short interventions at the request of the
government. MIGA believes that PROESA is now fully established to execute its
mandate. Further technical assistance will be based on ad-hoc client requests as opposed
to a structured assistance program.
81.
International Monetary Fund (IMF). El Salvador maintains a close policy
dialogue with the IMF, and does not plan to seek a formal arrangement. At the conclusion
of the 2003 Article IV consultation (July 18, 2003), the Executive Board praised El
Salvador for its record of fiscal prudence and impressive reforms since the early 1990s,
even in the face of the adverse shocks. However, the Directors also noted a fiscal
deterioration and sluggish growth in recent years, and encouraged the authorities to
address these challenges. In particular, the Directors urged the authorities to build on the
credibility of the dollarized regime by strengthening fiscal and financial sector policies,
and sustaining the structural reform effort. During the 2004 Article IV consultation
discussions (from October 25 to November 10, 2004), the staff encouraged the
authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen the fiscal position and pursue reforms with a
view to improving growth prospects and fortifying the economy against shocks. The
authorities explained that strengthening tax collections and deepening banking reforms
were key policy priorities. A Board meeting to conclude the 2004 Article IV consultation
is tentatively scheduled for January 2005.
82.
Aid Coordination. There is no formal aid coordination mechanism in place for El
Salvador (the last CG meeting, chaired by the IDB, was held in March 2001 following
the earthquakes) and the government coordinates assistance programs directly with each
of its creditors. Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is El Salvador’s main lender,
with 19 active projects at present totaling $679.1 million in earmarked funds. Over the
years the Bank has established a broad division of responsibilities with the IDB, and this
last CAS period proved no exception, with the IDB taking the lead on road infrastructure;
water and sanitation; environmental sustainability and local and urban development
projects. In turn the World Bank has taken the lead in assistance to primary and
secondary education, land administration and property rights reform, private sector
competitiveness, re-establishment of critical health services and judicial reform.

35

83.
The Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). CABEI has an
active portfolio of nine projects of US$298,2 million in El Salvador. As of June 30, 2004
it had disbursed US$104.8 million. Looking forward to the new CAS period, CABEI will
continue to focus on the first pillar in the government strategy, with large-scale lending
operations to improve the country’s physical infrastructure – these projects will span
ports development, telecommunication networks and nation-wide roads programs.
CABEI’s lending program will also complement the Bank’s support for sustainable rural
development projects.

The World Bank Group, IDB, CABEI, and other donors’ operations and their
links to development challenges are shown in the Table 7.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FY05-FY08

A. Bank Group Lending and Non Lending Services
85.
The Bank Group’s assistance over the four-year period covered by this CAS
(FY05-08) proposes a strategic program of lending and non-lending services to support
the three main pillars of the government’s development plan “Safe Country 2004-2009:
(i) to accelerate broad-based, equitable economic growth and increase employment; (ii) to
improve equity through building human capital and expanding access to socioeconomic
infrastructure, assets and markets; and (iii) to enhance security and reduce vulnerability.
Bank Group assistance (See Table 8) will include: (i) support for implementation of the
existing loan portfolio; (ii) new IBRD lending, including a Program of Development
Policy Loans, and investment operations in selective areas where the Bank has global
expertise and comparative advantage and which complement the activities of other key
development partners; (iii) analytical and advisory work, technical assistance, and
facilitation of access by El Salvador to grants administered by the World Bank; (iv)
learning and capacity development programs through the World Bank Institute (WBI)
and the Global Distance Learning Center (GDLN) and (v) targeted private sector
assistance provided by IFC and MIGA. Country Financial Parameters have been
prepared for El Salvador and this should facilitate the implementation of the proposed
program.
86.
The assistance strategy was developed in close partnership with the Government
of El Salvador. A workshop on the CAS was held in October 2004, with participation by
a broad range of stakeholders including Members of Congress, civil society, think-tanks,
private sector representatives and members of the international development community.
Participants discussed the findings and recommendations of recent Bank analytical
studies and provided input on proposed areas of future Bank assistance. In addition, a
series of smaller meetings were held with specific stakeholder groups to solicit their
views on how the Bank could best support El Salvador over the next four years. Annex
D provides a summary of the key points of the discussions. Overall, responses and views
were positive. Participants showed great interest in all the recent diagnostic reports
prepared by the Bank, and requested that there be opportunities for more dialogue and
feedback throughout the process of preparing future reports. Some stakeholders were
concerned about the recent increase in the level and cost of external debt in El Salvador
and asked the Bank to help the Government to develop a debt management strategy. In
this context, most participants welcomed the proposed Development Policy Lending
approach as a way to lower the costs of external financing. There was general support for
DPLs as a appropriate way for the Bank to support the country's own development
strategy and priorities, as long as efforts continued to strengthen the transparency and
effectiveness of budget expenditures.
87.
The central component of the Bank's assistance strategy in El Salvador would be a
programmatic series of Development Policy Loans (DPL) to support the Saca
government's medium term development strategy to accelerate broad based and equitable
38

economic growth. The DPLs would provide quick-disbursing budget support in line with
policy performance that would be synchronized with the government's annual budget and
would allow the government to reduce its external financing costs by partially replacing
higher cost bonds issued in the international capital markets. El Salvador's past track
record of sound macroeconomic management, significant policy and institutional reforms
and marked improvements in social indicators, as described earlier in this document,
make it a strong candidate to receive DPL assistance. The key areas to be supported by
the program of DPLs are summarized in Box 9.
BOX 9: KEY AREAS SUPPORTED BY THE PROGRAM OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOANS

•
•
•

Accelerating broad-based growth, including measures to expand international trade, improve the
investment climate, increase private participation in infrastructure and build innovation and
technological development.
Restoring a sound fiscal framework, including measures to increase tax revenues and strengthen the
financial sector.
Public sector modernization, including procurement reform and other measures to improve public
financial management and governance.

88.
The first DPL which will be submitted together with the Country Assistance
Strategy is based on critical prior actions in all three key areas, with a particular focus on
actions to improve the fiscal situation and generate the resources needed for additional
social spending. It also lays out indicative triggers for the second operation and
monitorable indicators of progress towards long-term goals related to the three key areas.
The design of key prior actions, triggers and indicators is underpinned by a substantial
body of analytic work carried out by the Bank in partnership with the Government of El
Salvador over the last few years, including the five core diagnostic reports. The DPL
series will support gradual implementation of measures identified in the CFAA and
CPAR to enhance governance, transparency and efficiency in public spending. Future
DPL operations are expected to shift gradually to focus on the international trade and
business environment, drawing on the DR-CAFTA study, the Investment Climate
Assessment, the follow up to the FSAP, the REDI and technical assistance to enhance
public-private participation in infrastructure. A Country Environmental Analysis will be
carried out to review the policy and institutional framework and make recommendations
especially in relation to infrastructure policies and trade expansion under DR-CAFTA.
89.
As described in the following sections, and summarized in Table 8, the series of
DPLs will be accompanied by selective investment lending in key areas where the Bank
has global expertise and which build upon prior successful implementation of innovative
operations in El Salvador, and which complement activities of other partners. In order to
be responsive to the government’s needs, and taking into account election cycle
considerations, investment lending will be clustered in FY05-07. The CAS also includes
a program of regional and country specific AAA (See Box 10).

39

BOX 10: THE AAA PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR
Over the last few years, despite the limited level of lending the Bank made a significant investment in the
delivery of AAA to El Salvador, including preparation of the five core diagnostic reports, follow up to the
FSAP and a Corporate Social Responsibility Framework. The recent Country AAA Assessment for El
Salvador by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated the program as highly satisfactory overall, noting
that AAA played a central role in the Bank's assistance in El Salvador during FY02-04, allowing the Bank
to rebuild its relationship with the client through the provision of knowledge services after a period when
the Bank was largely absent from the country. The QAG Assessment found that the AAA program
responded to the government's policy agenda, that tasks were timely and took into account the political
cycle, and that the work focused on key issues and brought analytical depth that was highly respected by
the government authorities and many stakeholders. Overall, the Assessment concluded that the AAA
program made a substantial intellectual contribution on the structure of thinking about reforms and in the
quality of the debate in the country and that it contributed to a change in the governments approach to
poverty reduction. The quality and strategic relevance of the AAA work has also contributed to changing
the Government's traditional reluctance to borrow from the Bank and has underpinned the design of the
Development Policy Loan Program.
While recognizing the dissemination efforts made - through posting reports on the Internet and organization
of large workshops with substantial press coverage - the QAG Assessment recommends more resources for
and greater attention to dissemination in the future, in order to move from "presentations" to continuous
substantive dialogue and consultation with stakeholders. They recommend that all reports be translated
into Spanish to broaden public access and build advocates for policies the Bank would support. Noting
that Salvadorians like to be "more than an audience and consultants" the Assessment recommends more
effort to develop local partners and engage in one-to-one dialogue outside the government, including with
those who may not share the government’s and the Bank's views on development.
AAA will continue to be a critical part of the Bank's assistance during FY05-08. Initial focus will be on
analytical work to inform the Government's growth agenda, including finalization of the Investment
Climate Assessment and the DR-CAFTA regional study in FY05, and the Recent Economic Developments
in Infrastructure (REDI) report in FY06. This work will help underpin the dialogue and design of
subsequent Development Policy Loans. A Country Environmental Analysis, to be completed in FY06,
which will assess the country's environmental institutional set-up and policy framework and make
recommendations, particularly in the area of sustainable infrastructure development and implementation of
DR-CAFTA. Regional studies on Education (FY05), Shocks and Social Protection (FY05) and Health
(FY06) will contribute to the government's efforts to improve equity and develop a more effective social
protection strategy. The core diagnostic reports will be updated in FY07 and FY08, with the particular
areas of focus to determined in close consultation with the Government and other partners and stakeholders
to ensure strategic relevance and avoid duplication.

90.
Support to Pillar I – Accelerating broad-based equitable economic growth.
A fundamental element of the government’s strategy is the maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic framework including fiscal responsibility and further improvements in
the investment and business climate and trade policies as the foundation for private
sector-led broad-based economic growth. The main support to the government’s policy
agenda under this pillar would be a series of DPLs as described earlier. The Bank would
also provide technical assistance to the government to review the development and
implementation of a debt management strategy. In addition to assisting the government
in broadening access to economic opportunities, an investment project Ensuring SME
participation in DR-CAFTA, US$10m (FY06), would focus on improving critical

40

elements of the investment climate for SMEs and would complement a fast disbursing
budget support operation to enhance competitiveness financed by IADB. An Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA) FY05, will collect and analyze information and formulate
recommendations to overcome the main constraints to investment, productivity growth
and exports. A Recent Economic Developments in Infrastructure Report, REDI (FY06)
will carry out a comprehensive assessment of El Salvador’s electricity,
telecommunications, transport (roads, ports, airports and urban transport), and water and
sanitation sectors. Technical assistance to Improve Infrastructure through Public-Private
partnerships (PPIAF) is also planned to promote the new infrastructure investment
needed to enhance El Salvador’s capacity to compete in the global economy and attract
foreign investments.

Given the challenges and opportunities the Salvadorian private sector faces, IFC’s
aim is to help it position itself competitively inside and outside the Central American
region. IFC is prepared to support local companies to become regional players in the
financial and other sectors, and encourage cross-country investments. Complementing the
Bank’s support to this growth pillar through assistance, such as DPLs and a US$10
million investment project to improve the investment climate for the SME sector, IFC’s
activities during this CAS period are expected to focus on supporting the strengthening of
the private sector’s competitiveness and IFC’s priorities will include: (i) continuing to
assist in the development of the housing sector via financing and technical assistance; (ii)
helping to strengthen infrastructure (including power); (iii) supporting the MSME sector
via financing or technical assistance; and (iv) promoting sustainable business practices
(including corporate governance, environmental and social management, and corporate
responsibility programs). As in other countries in Central America, IFC’s support to El
Salvador is also provided through regional projects. IFC’s priorities in the Central
America region include: helping improve physical infrastructure; strengthening and
broadening the financial sector, including access to term financing by micro, small and
medium enterprises; supporting competitive firms in agriculture, industry and services;
and promoting investments from other LAC and emerging market countries into Central
America. FIAS has collaborated closely with the Government in the strengthening of an
education-based Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy and is prepared to work
with the new administration to assist in making CSR an integral part of its
competitiveness strategy.
92.
As mentioned previously, MIGA has been assisting PROESA since its inception
and has achieved significant results. The systems MIGA has worked to create with
PROESA are in place and operational, and El Salvador now has a fully functioning
investment promotion agency that has the tools it needs to achieve solid results. MIGA is
prepared to respond to specific requests from the Government for further technical
assistance. In the area of investment guarantees, MIGA does not have any outstanding
coverage. The Agency is actively examining opportunities to provide coverage to foreign
operations interested in locating in El Salvador and also able to assist Salvadoran
companies as they seek opportunities overseas. MIGA has worked with the government
and Central Bank to reduce reserve requirements for Salvadoran banks that lend with
MIGA insurance. MIGA expects this to permit Salvadoran banks to expand their
financial operations in the Central America region and beyond.
93.
To support the government in deepening insertion in world markets through
regional integration and trade, the Bank is actively involved in the Trade CapacityBuilding group for DR-CAFTA and has developed an assistance program that includes
analytical and advisory support, as well as grant funds. While El Salvador boasts one of
the most open trade regimes in Latin America, DR-CAFTA could eventually affect the
welfare of some segments of Salvadoran society that still benefit from some residual
protection. Admittedly, these potential impacts would take some time to materialize, as
Central American negotiators obtained lengthy grace periods (5 to 10 years) and gradual
phase out periods for sensitive commodities (up to 20 years). However, a PSIA will be
undertaken to assess the expected impact of DR-CAFTA on the poor and to identify
potential effects on protected segments. This study would complement the ongoing
43

regional ESW on the impact of DR-CAFTA in Central America (scheduled for delivery
in FY05) and ongoing work to support programs that ensure that small and medium
enterprises can also benefit from the benefits of the agreement through an Institutional
Development Fund Grant of US$ 500,000 administered by SIECA and a regional grant of
US$ 500,000 from the Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP).
94.
To assist the government in the area of market regulation and supervision
Technical Assistance for Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) follow-up is planned and
support from the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST)7 Initiative is
envisaged. An Accounting & Auditing (A&A) module of the Reports on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) is planned for FY05 which will to assess the degree to
which corporate entities and auditors effectively comply with international accounting and
auditing standards.
95.
As noted earlier, the Bank recently completed a Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM) which identified the key constraints to sustained growth and identified priority
areas to help promote faster economic growth. The CEM would be updated toward the
end of the CAS period in order to measure progress in reaching the Government’s
development objectives and look forward to future challenges. Analysis would be focused
on areas identified by the Government as of specific interest and relevance to El Salvador,
for example the informal sector and remittances.
96.
Support for Pillar 2 - improving equity through building human capital and
enhancing access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure and markets. The CAS will
support the government’s strategy to improve equity through the implementation of
ongoing operations, the development of two new investment operations and selected
economic and sector work, analytical and advisory services, grants and technical
assistance. Complementing the Bank’s work, IFC will help improve equity through the
on-lending instruments being provided for MSMEs, thereby broadening their access to
financial market. In addition, IFC’s LAC SME Facility may be tapped on to build
capacity of SMEs should it become operational in El Salvador.
97.
In order to assist the government in its goal to modernize education and build a
knowledge society, the ongoing Secondary Education Project is working to extend a
participatory approach to secondary education, broadening its coverage in rural areas,
financing school rehabilitation and maintenance, improving its cost-effectiveness with an
enhanced role for the private sector and upgrading the content and relevance of the
curricula. An ongoing Education Reform Project aims to ensure that at least 90 percent of
children complete basic education with emphasis on the poorest rural and urban areas. In
terms of new lending, new Education Reform Project, US$85m (FY06) is planned and
would support the new long-term education plan of El Salvador. A PHRD project
preparation grant will finance key preparatory studies for the education project. The Bank
will continue to support the preparation of the long term Education Plan (Plan 2021) by
7

This is a multi-donor joint venture undertaken by the World Bank, IMF, the UK, Switzerland, Canada, the
Netherlands, and Sweden to provide technical assistance for capacity building and policy development in
the areas of financial sector regulation, supervision and development.

44

helping finalize the integrated diagnostic and supporting a wide consultation process on
the priorities of the plan.
98.
To assist in the improvement of the quality and universal coverage of health
services, the ongoing Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction and Health Services
Extension Project supports the reconstruction of seven major hospitals, the modernization
of the Ministry of Health, the improvement of hospital care and the extension of essential
health and nutrition services through community-based outreach, and supports selected
priority national health issues including detection and control of HIV/AIDS and the most
prevalent vector-borne diseases, health waste management and environmental health,
community health promotion and education. El Salvador along with the other CentralAmerica countries is the beneficiary of a upcoming Central America Regional HIV/AIDS
Grant Project (FY05 US$8 million) that aims to strengthen the regional capacity to
monitor the spread of the HIV epidemic through the upgrade of a regional clinical
laboratory able to carry out the pathology exams necessary to detect and follow-up
HIV/AIDS patients.
99.
In order to assist the government in the strengthening of family assets, the
ongoing Land Administration I project is supporting the establishment of a national
cadastre and the modernization of the National Property Registry that integrates the land
and real estate property registry, the intellectual property registry, the commercial registry,
the cadastre and the mapping agency. By the end of 2004, the project was projected to
have cadastred 60% of the parcels and transferred all properties into a new computerized
property registry, and started providing more efficient and accessible services country
wide. An upcoming Land Administration II, US$40m (FY05) project will build on the
ongoing program and will focus on the legal base of urban and rural property. It would
extend geographically to cover the rest of the country and include two new activities, the
training of municipalities in cadastre management and limited urban and rural titling
programs in areas of social interest which are not yet titled. In parallel, a GEF-funded
operation is being prepared, which would provide up to US$ 5 million in GEF Grants to
fund complementary conservation-related activities.
100. To support the government in the local and regional development the upcoming
REDI study and PPIAF grant will provide additional data on coverage, quality and access
to infrastructure and help support dialogue and consensus building on the sector policy,
regulations and institutional reform needed to enhance access to basic infrastructure
services, and promote greater participation of the private sector.
101. As noted earlier, the Bank recently completed a Poverty Assessment and Public
Expenditure review which provided inputs into the diagnosis of key constraints and
identification of priority policy and institutional reforms and investment needs to build
human capital and generate growth. These studies would be updated towards the end of
the CAS period in order to review progress in reaching El Salvador’s development goals.
Fiscal measures supported under the proposed CAS lending program are not expected to
exert significant impact on the poor. To confirm this conclusion, a PSIA on fiscal and
pension issues will be conducted during 2005. The analysis will focus on the distributive
impact of recent changes to the Salvadoran tax code and pension regime.

45

102. Support for Pillar 3 - Enhancing security and reducing vulnerability
Improving security is a key pillar in GOES’s development plan. The vision of a “Safe
Country” encompasses a broad definition of security, including improved physical safety,
increased investor security through initiatives to combat corruption and increase
transparency and greater public confidence in public institutions including the judiciary.
The government plans to reduce vulnerability through the development of a social
protection program for poor households and improvement of environmental and disaster
management. The Bank would provide support to the government in reaching its goals
though ongoing investment projects and three new investment operations, as well as
advisory services, technical assistance and grants in the area of social protection, public
procurement and environmental management. IFC’s work on promoting sustainable
business practices will also help enhance both investor and citizen security in El Salvador.
103. To assist in the improvement of transparency and efficiency of resource use,
the ongoing Public Sector Modernization Project supports El Salvador in implementing a
public sector modernization program to define new roles for the public sector and its most
important entities, strengthen performance, accountability and transparency for those
entities that remain in the public sector, and involve the private sector in the provision of
public services. The future Modernization of the State II, US$10m (FY07) project would
continue to support the modernization of the state, and the implementation of
recommendations made in the recently completed CFAA, CPAR and PER, including
assistance for initiatives to combat corruption and further improve transparency, and
modernization of local governments and support to the decentralization agenda. An
Institutional Facility Grant (IDF) will assist in implementing the Government of El
Salvador’s public procurement modernization plan.
104. In order to assist GOES in improving the rule of law, the ongoing Judicial
Reform Project supports a plan to enhance the effectiveness, accessibility and credibility
of judicial branch. Special attention is given to broadening access to justice by the poor
and disadvantaged groups, developing alternative dispute settlement arrangements,
improving court procedures and legal assistance programs, enhancing quality services
through a new supervision mechanism and developing a judicial career.
105. To support GOES’ goals of enhancing the environment for future generations,
a Pilot Environmental Services Project (FY05, US$5 million) would be prepared to
support the design and implementation of an environmental services system that sells
services to both the public and private sectors. Pilot activities have already been tested in
El Salvador co-financed by the private sector—the only example in the region. A GEF
Grant (FY05, US$5 million) would help set up the legal and institutional framework for
this to operate.
106. While DR-CAFTA is expected to improve enforcement of environmental norms
and regulations due explicit commitments in the treaty to this effect, future DPL
operations are expected to give more emphasis to investments in infrastructure and DRCAFTA is expected to lead to greater levels of trade and investment, which could pose
some challenges to El Salvador’s capacity to manage potential environmental risks. The
Bank will work with the government to prepare a Country Environmental Analysis (CEA)

46

to be finalized in FY06. The CEA will develop a sound analytic understanding of the
country and sector-wide institutional set-up and policy framework and provide guidance
and advice to the national environmental strategy and policy which is being developed.
The analysis will be done in close coordination with the REDI diagnostic and preparation
of the DPLs to provide the Government with recommendations that would be relevant as
it pursues new policies to spur sustainable infrastructure development and expand trade
under DR-CAFTA. El Salvador will also benefit from a Central American Regional
Grant for US$2 million from Bank Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) for the
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor which is aimed at consolidating actions taken in
Central America to conserve and sustain their natural resources. Special emphasis in the
future will be given to finding markets for sustainable products. A Central American
Regional GEF Grant, Integrated Ecosystem Management by Indigenous People and
Communities (FY05, US$9 million) will help achieve more effective biodiversity
conservation in Central America by strengthening the capacity of indigenous communities
to protect and manage their natural and cultural resources, and by recuperating and
promoting their cultural values and sustainable traditional land use practices.
107. In order to aid the government in the development of a more effective safety net
the upcoming Social Protection and Local Development Project, US$35m (FY06), would
support the development of a national social policy with a primary objective of developing
and implementing a social safety net targeted to the poorest and most vulnerable families
in the country. The development of the government’s overall social policy is informed by
the Poverty Assessment and the appropriate chapters of the Public Expenditure Review.
As mentioned before, the Bank would propose to update these reports towards the end of
the CAS period. Also, a Central America-wide study on Shocks and Social Protection
(FY05) will assess the recent experience of households in coping with external shocks
such as the coffee crisis and the efficacy of public programs in protecting households’
consumption and human capital development during economic shocks. The study will
provide inputs into the Social Protection project, and more broadly will help the
government in the development of its overall social policy.
B. Country Financing Parameters
108. The Country Financing Parameters for El Salvador have been prepared and agreed
upon by the government (See Annex C). As regards cost sharing the Government has
shown strong commitment to and ownership of its development program. Bank-financed
projects are fully integrated into the budget and are well aligned with the government’s
development plans. The Government finances a large share of its social development
spending8 (about 74% after taking into consideration other multilateral and bilateral
disbursements). The Bank’s lending program represents a small share of the country’s
social development spending. Between 2000 and 2003, Bank disbursements have
averaged US$46 million annually – equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP. This amount
represents a small portion of El Salvador Central Government social development
spending of about US$1,095 million or about 7.3 percent of GDP in 2003. Quality of El
8

Social Development expenditures were used as a proxy for overall development expenditures as the former
represent the vast part of the latter and exact data on overall development expenditures was not available.

47

Salvador’s budget processes are good. Given these factors, the Bank may finance up to
100 percent of costs of individual operations. 100 percent financing is expected to be
applied selectively to stay within the overall CAS lending envelope. Specific
arrangements would be determined for individual projects, taking into account the project
context and the borrower’s financing from its own resources of the sector concerned.
Land administration and social sector projects (mostly education and social protection) are
expected to be in the 70 to 85 percent range while projects with a technical assistance
focus (e.g., modernization of the state) could finance up to 100% of the cost.
109. Recurrent cost financing. The Bank’s current portfolio devotes a relatively
modest share of its funds to the financing of recurrent costs ranging from 15 percent (for
infrastructure and other projects), to approximately 40 percent for social sector projects.
These costs have traditionally been related to project administration (vehicles, equipment
and software), teachers salaries and textbooks. Given the nature of projects in the
proposed lending pipeline, recurrent cost financing is expected to stay closer to the level
and types observed for social sector projects. As discussed earlier, the overall fiscal
situation is stable, and is being strengthened under the Government’s “Safe Country 20042009” plan, which includes measures to increase tax revenues, strengthen the financial
sector and reduce external debt ratios. According to the recent CFAA, public investment
expenditures (including those financed by Bank projects) are well integrated into the
budget formulation and execution cycles. This accomplishment could serve as basis for
the Government to begin undertaking systematic calculations of the recurrent spending
portion of investment projects and their implications in future current expenditures. More
importantly, El Salvador has been a regional leader in key areas of Bank support,
maintaining an excellent record of sustainability of Bank-financed projects in areas such
as Land Administration, Education, Competitiveness and Public Sector Modernization.
Based on the above, no specific country-level limit on Bank-financing of recurrent costs is
proposed. In determining recurrent-cost financing for individual projects, the Bank will
take into account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels, as well as implied
future budgetary outlays.
110. Local cost financing. The country’s development expenditures are about 7.3
percent of GDP in 2003. The Government’s own resources (from taxes, non-taxes, and
domestic borrowing) dedicated to cover such development expenditures are approximately
5.6 percent of GDP in 2003; therefore, projected domestic revenues are insufficient to fill
the development program gap, which amounts to 1.7 percent of GDP. In addition, the
financing of only foreign investment expenditures will not be sufficient to provide
required resources to projects. The Bank has been financing significant local costs in El
Salvador: disbursements against local costs have accounted for 74%, 90% and 90% of
investment lending disbursements in FY02, FY03 and FY04 respectively. This important
level of local costs is expected to continue in future investment projects, specially with the
land administration, social protection and education projects. Therefore, as the two
requirements for Bank financing of local costs are met, the Bank may finance local and
foreign costs in any proportion required for individual projects.
111. Taxes and duties. The country’s tax structure depends basically on revenues from
the value added tax (VAT) and the income tax, which generated jointly over 82 percent of

48

the total in 2003. The VAT rate is 13% and contributes over half of tax revenues, while
the income tax rates range from 10 to 30 percent for individuals and is 25 percent for
firms. The remainder is collected through import duties (with a 5 percent average tariff at
end 2003) and excise taxes on specific products (mostly taxed at a 20 percent rate). Bankfinanced projects are taxed at the same rates as the country’s normal rates, which are
reasonable and non-discriminatory. Therefore, the Bank may finance all taxes and duties
associated with its projects. At the project level, the Bank will consider whether taxes and
duties constitute an excessively high share of project expenditures.
C. Risks and Lending Cases
112. The CAS program has been designed in close partnership with the Government of
El Salvador to respond to financial and development needs identified by the Saca
administration as best suited to support from the World Bank Group. It aims to maximize
the Bank’s responsiveness to the Government’s requests, while minimizing risks
through careful monitoring of progress; scaling fast disbursing lending to policy
performance momentum; focusing investment lending on areas where the Bank has
established global expertise and which build on El Salvador’s previous strong record of
innovation, sustained impact and results; and linking the pace of investment lending to
continued proactive implementation and problem solving by the Government.
113. The slow down in Government borrowing from the Bank under the previous CAS
has reduced Bank exposure to El Salvador from what had been projected under the
previous CAS, creating space for the proposed series of Development Policy Loans and a
more robust investment lending program. An increase in Bank lending at this juncture
would help, at more reasonable cost and consistent with a strategy to diversify financing
sources, to bridge the country to a stronger fiscal position -- resulting from reforms in
revenue generation and expenditure containment (pension reform measures)-- without
sacrificing the Government’s commitment to increasing social spending and meeting the
needs of the poor.
114. The scale of Bank’s financial assistance would be determined by the
Government’s ability to maintain its high level of performance across the three pillars of
the 2004-2009 Strategy, with special attention to fiscal sustainability measures. To access
increased lending levels, performance will be assessed on progress toward objectives in
the set of strategic policy areas identified in Table 9. The base case could include up to
$300 million in Development Policy Lending and $185 in investment lending, provided
progress can be documented (using the indicative indicators in Table 9, or other
appropriate measurements). To move into a high case lending scenario, implying up to
one additional $100 million DPL, would require performance on the specific fiscal
sustainability measures indicated in Table 9. Progress on Table 9 indicators and measures
and their relevance to broader policy performance will be assessed in a CAS Progress
Report (FY07). In addition, to ensure appropriate scaling of fast-disbursing financial
support to policy performance on key fronts, the number and timing of DPLs in both the
base and high cases would be further determined by the specific prior actions and triggers
included in the DPL documents (which management and the Board would review
separately from this CAS).

49

•

Steady policy performance across the three pillars, continuing financial needs, and
proactive problem solving in implementation of the investment portfolio would be
the basis for support in the higher end of the base case range; up to $485 million
over 4 years, including $300 million in a series of 3 fast-disbursing DPLs.
Policy performance would be monitored based on progress toward a few
strategically significant policy objectives described in Table 9, including fiscal
sustainability, trade policy, social expenditure and basic education targets. These
in effect amount to “pre-conditions” for the higher lending range. At the high end
of the base case, Bank exposure would increase from about US$360 million in
FY04 to around US$700 million in FY07.

•

Less rapid progress in policy reform, but continued commitment and a lack of
action on portfolio implementation issues would be the basis for support in the
lower end of the base case range; $375 million over 4 years. In this scenario
the program would be limited to two fast disbursing DPLs and one or two
investment loans would be postponed until action on project effectiveness were
solved. At the lower end of the base case range, exposure would increase to
around US$600 million in FY08.

•

Aggressive policy performance would give the Government access to the high
case which would comprise one additional $100 million DPL in FY08. This
would entail maintaining momentum across the three CAS pillars while
demonstrating a reduction in both public sector debt and bringing the NFPS deficit
at or below 2%. Additional triggers for a fourth DPL would be elaborated in DPL
3. Bank exposure to El Salvador under the high case would increase to just over
$800 million (constituting less that 1% of the total IBRD portfolio).

•

Halting or back-tracking on policy reform would result in a low-case scenario. In
this case the Bank would seek to reduce its exposure by curtailing further
development policy lending. Additional investment lending would be considered
on a case-by-case basis based on social need and likelihood of impact.

115. Continued strong performance by the Government is subject to three sources
of risk during the CAS period: possible political gridlock, threat of natural disaster,
and a deteriorating external environment which could forestall needed growth.
Moreover, El Salvador’s current debt burden, approaching 40 percent of GDP, increases
its vulnerability to potential shocks. Such fiscal vulnerabilities are further compounded by
El Salvador’s dollarized regime, which limits potential macroeconomic responses in times
of stress. As rating agencies have increasingly voiced over the past year, a credible plan to
address the fiscal area is required to prevent a deterioration of El Salvador’s hard earned
creditworthiness. As discussed earlier in this document, the Saca administration is aware
of the country’s fiscal vulnerability, has put forward a credible plan to address it and has
begun putting the plan into action.

NFPS debt is defined to include both short- and long-term domestic and external public debt, excluding the net debt of the Central
Bank and other public banks. If these unconsolidated data are not available, then the High Case benchmark will be public sector
debt (inclusive of net debt of the Central Bank and other public banks) below 47.4% of GDP at end-2007.
* Social expenditures (gastos para Desarrollo Social) as defined in the national budget, excluding transfers for pensions and
municipalities.

116. On the political front, a divided Assembly could become an obstacle to important
reforms, despite the strong electoral mandate obtained by President Saca. The inability to
push through measures to increase tax revenues and control expenditures would likely
raise public debt, which could adversely affect investor sentiment and the availability of
external finance. Likewise, failure to move on financial sector reform could lead to
materialization of contingent liabilities in state-run banks. To date, the Government’s
approach to consensus building appears to be bearing fruit, but political obstacles to
reform can not yet be fully ruled out. Potentially tense relations with the Assembly could
also impede prompt ratification of external loans limiting access to funds for social
development or forcing use of higher cost financing, as has been the case historically.
Two aspects of this CAS mitigate against such an outcome. For the DPL series, through
which the bulk of lending is expected to be channeled, the Government expects that
concurrent submission of the DPLs and the annual budget to the Assembly will give it the
leverage needed for prompt loan ratification. For investment loans, the Government’s plan
to bunch operations early in its tenure is expected to facilitate timely ratification.
117. As to possible exogenous external risks, many of the same sources of fiscal
vulnerability could cloud the horizon, delay the expected recovery and worsen debt
dynamics. For 2004, growth is expected to reach only 1.8%. This poor performance is in
part related to short-term factors, such as political jitters surrounding the presidential
election, delays in government investment plans due to the late approval of the 2004
budget, high oil prices and weakness in maquila exports and investments in anticipation of
the scheduled end of textile quotas by 2005 in the United States and other markets which
is expected to intensify competition from China and other Asian countries. Going
forward, sustained high oil prices or a new international recession could also affect El
Salvador’s economy, as well as a worsening of the domestic political atmosphere that
delays passage of important fiscal initiatives. Early approval of DR-CAFTA, together
with continued steady implementation of the Government’s plans to improve the
investment climate, further strengthen of the financial sector, and increase investments in
human capital should provide a new impetus to investment and growth.
118. Finally, the country remains vulnerable to natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes and
hurricanes) which can hurt the performance of the economy in the short-term and may
require significant unanticipated expenditures for emergency assistance and
reconstruction. The Government’s focus on improving fiscal responsibility and restoring
broad-base growth while building a stronger social safety net position it to better absorb
such shocks in the future. Should El Salvador be subject to shocks arising from natural
disasters or other external factors, a contingency scenario may be called for, which is not
considered in this CAS. In that case, the Bank team would develop an alternative program
for discussion with the Board.
119. The Government of El Salvador and the Bank have agreed to monitor the program
on an annual basis to assess progress which would determine any revisions to the scale
and timing of the Bank’s lending program. This formal stocktaking would be
complemented by periodic policy discussions aimed at identifying areas of strengths and
weaknesses and possible assistance needed to maintain momentum toward the
Government’s planned medium-term outcomes and address possible downside risks.

52

120. CAS Results Framework. The Government of El Salvador and the Bank have
agreed to a results framework shown in Annex B1. The results framework was
constructed on the basis of El Salvador's development challenges outlined in this proposed
country strategy. The monitoring indicators were developed jointly with the Government
and Government is fully committed to achieving the results specified. Progress toward
the medium-term outcomes, to which the government and all its partners, including the
Bank Group, contribute, should be achievable within the CAS period (2005-2008) and
will be monitored using intermediate indicators and the Government’s own data collection
and monitoring and evaluation systems. The results monitoring framework lays out
planned lending and non-lending Bank activities which contribute towards specific
outcomes during the CAS implementation period. Progress within the framework will be
reviewed during periodic joint program reviews between the government and the Bank’s
country team. It should be noted that the indicators to be monitored are already effectively
collected on a regular basis by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and the sectoral
line ministries. Bank staff has reviewed the existing systems for data collection and
information related to the results identified and found them to be of adequate quality to
enable meaningful monitoring of development progress.

Annex C

EL SALVADOR: COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS
Item
Cost sharing. Limit on the
proportion of individual project costs
that the Bank may finance

Parameter
Up to 100 percent

Remarks / Explanation
100 percent financing is expected to
be applied selectively to stay within
the overall CAS lending envelope.
Specific arrangements would be
determined for individual projects,
allowing technical assistance projects
to finance up to 100 percent of the
cost if necessary, while land
administration and social sector
projects are expected to be in the 70
to 85 percent range.

Recurrent cost financing. Any
limits that would apply to the overall
amount of recurrent expenditures that
the Bank may finance

No country-level
limit

In determining recurrent cost
financing in individual projects, the
Bank will take into account
sustainability issues at the sector and
project levels and implied future
budgetary outlays.

Local cost financing. Are the
requirements for Bank financing of
local expenditures met? Namely that:
(i) financing requirements for the
country’s development program
would exceed the public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation and
other revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the
financing of foreign expenditures
alone would not enable the Bank to
assist in the financing of individual
projects

Yes

The two requirements are met. The
Bank may therefore finance local
costs in the proportions needed in
individual projects.

Taxes and duties. Are there any
taxes and duties that the Bank would
not finance?

None

No taxes or duties are currently
identified as unreasonable or
discriminatory. At the project level,
the Bank would consider whether
taxes and duties constitute an
excessively high share of project
expenditures.

Annex D - CAS Consultations with Salvadoran Stakeholders
Consultations on the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for El Salvador were
held in San Salvador from October 4-6, 2004. The Bank was represented at these
consultations as follows: Jane Armitage (Country Director), Nicolette Bowyer (Country
Officer), Manuel Sevilla (FPSI Sector Leader), Felipe Jaramillo (Lead Economist and
PREM Sector Leader), Ana-Lucia Armijos (Country Economist) and Eduardo Wallentin
(Manager, IFC). In addition, David de Ferranti, (Vice President, Latin America and the
Caribbean) held a series of small meetings with members of the executive branch,
representatives from the different political parties and with the private sector and
foundations/think tanks.
The more formal round of consultations on the CAS centered on a one-day workshop
attended by approximately 150 participants, including representatives of the executive
branch of government, the judicial sector, members of the Salvadoran congress, local
governments, academia and think-tanks, foundations, civil society, the international
donor community, the private sector and media. During the morning session, the Bank
team made presentations on two core diagnostic reports (the Poverty Assessment and the
Public Expenditure Review), followed by a general discussion and a lively question and
answer session. The Country Director made a power-point presentation summarizing the
Bank Group’s current assistance program in El Salvador, together with a brief
explanation of the different entities comprising the World Bank Group and its main
lending and non-lending instruments and outlining the proposed areas of emphasis for the
new CAS for FY05-08. Prior to the meeting, summaries in Spanish of the two core
diagnostic reports and of the Country Economic Memorandum were posted on the Bank’s
website, together with a document summarizing the Bank’s current portfolio and recent
AAA activities in El Salvador, and a tentative list of proposed new lending and nonlending activities.
In the afternoon, a participatory methodology—known as tecnica Delphi—was
implemented with the help of a local consultant with extensive experience in facilitating
dialogue. The methodology allowed for a set of productive and frank discussions with
the different stakeholders, aimed at soliciting participants’ views on the key development
challenges facing El Salvador and on the possible role of the Bank in helping the country
to respond to these challenges. Based on the three pillars of growth, equity and security
underpinning the Government’s development plan “Safe Country”, thematic working
groups were set up with participants invited to join the thematic group of their choice.
Each working group elected a team leader, a rapporteur and a secretary. The groups were
provided with a set of core questions (See Box 1) designed to orient and stimulate the
discussion, without constraining the scope and content of the dialogue. The groups were
extremely well attended, and the discussions were lively and frank, with participants
showing a high degree of engagement, technical knowledge and enthusiasm. At the end
of the day, each working group made a short presentation highlighting the main points
from their discussions. A report on the workshop including the list of the participants,
description of the methodology, detailed notes from the discussions of each working

1

group and a summary of the key points, has been prepared by the local consultant and can
be found on the Bank’s website at www.worldbank.org/elsalvador .
Box 1 – Set of Questions used with Consultations participants

8. Que tipo de indicadores y sistemas de monitoreo serian útiles para evaluar el impacto del
apoyo del Banco en El Salvador? (What kind of indicators or monitoring systems would be useful to
evaluate the impact of the support of the Bank in El Salvador?)

Below is a summary of the views expressed by the different groups of stakeholders
during the workshop and in other meetings.
Executive branch of government
The Government endorsed the Bank’s proposed areas of support, allocation of lending
(split between quick-disbursing budgetary support and specific investment projects) and
non-lending activities, and the trigger conditions for the different lending scenarios. With
respect to the timetable for lending, the government requested that the timing of the
Development Policy Loans (DPLs) be aligned with El Salvador’s budget cycle so as to
allow the National Assembly to approve and ratify DPL2 (and subsequent DPLs) together
with the national budget. The Government also confirmed that the proposed areas for
Bank investment lending supported key priorities of their development plan, and
explained that other development partners were providing support in areas such as
agriculture and rural development. The Government requested the Bank’s support in its
efforts to obtain resources and technical assistance for other areas of strategic importance
such as promoting private participation in infrastructure, strengthening the financial

2

sector, enhancing the development impact of remittances and increasing the productivity
of the informal sector. They also requested technical assistance from the Bank to develop
a debt management strategy, and expressed interest in tapping the full range of IBRD’s
financial instruments, possibly in the context of a Master Derivatives Agreement. The
Government expressed strong interest in greater involvement by IFC in El Salvador.
Finally, the Government requested that the Bank open a small office in El Salvador in
order to assist the Government more closely in the implementation of the Bank’s program
and to strengthen coordination with other stakeholders and partners, especially given the
larger proposed assistance package.
International Donor Community
The donors emphasized the need for greater coordination between Cooperation Agencies
in El Salvador to promote efficiency in the use of scarce resources. In particular, they
noted the need for greater coordination, and where possible, joint preparation of key
studies, to avoid duplication and overloading the Salvadoran Government and other
stakeholders with multiple reports on the same topics (e.g. growth and poverty
reduction), which sometimes reached conflicting conclusions due to different
methodologies or definitions. They further agreed that improving the statistical data
bases in El Salvador, including carrying out a new Census and Households Living
Standards Measurement Survey, was a top priority. Some donors expressed concern that
the Bank was not planning new investment operations to support agriculture and rural
development. The Country Director explained that the Government had indicated that
these areas were already supported by other donors, such as IDB, CABEI and IFAD.
With respect to the DPLs, while some donors expressed skepticism about the benefits of
delinking financial assistance from specific project activities others such as the European
Community supported the concept of providing support to the Government’s own
development program and priorities through quick disbursing budget support.
Civil Society
A broad sample of civil society organizations participated in the CAS consultations
(including leaders from organizations advocating on behalf of women, indigenous
groups, and other minorities). They reiterated the important role they play in the
development of the country. Participants welcomed the opportunity to discuss the
diagnosis of the country’s key challenges set out in the Bank’s core analytical reports.
Some participants expressed frustration that they had not received copies of the reports in
advance (Spanish summaries of the reports were posted on the web about ten days before
the meeting, but clearly some participants had not been able to access them). More
generally, participants asked that in the future the Bank engage directly with civil society
throughout the entire process of preparing analytical reports, including organizing regular
public fora to discuss specific themes, and that opportunities for joint studies be
exploited, for example by developing strategic alliances with local academic institutions,
professional associations, think-tanks, etc.
Other specific ideas were proposed to enhance the dissemination of Bank reports,
including through the web, via videoconferences, mass media, and preparation of less

3

technical packages for broader dissemination and for use by educational institutions.
Many suggestions were made for deeper analysis, including the treatment of gender,
issues affecting senior citizens, security/violence, natural disasters and external shocks,
structure and costs of external debt, and the impact of migration and remittances. Many
participants emphasized the poor quality of the data in El Salvador, including the absence
of a recent population or agricultural census, and the need for household surveys.
With relation to the proposed Bank’s current and proposed lending program
representatives of civil society concluded that the proposed areas of activity were well
aligned with the country’s development priorities. Many participants expressed interest
in getting more information about Bank-financed operations (including via the internet)
and recommended that the Bank strengthen the involvement of civil society in the
formulation, implementation and evaluation of projects to cost-effective use of resources
and that benefits reach the largest number of poor people. Most participants were
supportive of the proposal for the Bank to provide budget support to El Salvador through
an annual series of DPLs as a way to reduce the costs of external financing and provide
an “international seal of approval” for El Salvador’s development strategy. While some
expressed concern about the fact that DPLs “provide a blank check”, most liked the idea
that the Bank would be supporting the country’s own development program and
priorities, and appreciated the speed and flexibility offered by this instrument, while
emphasizing the need for continued improvements in the efficiency and transparency of
public expenditures and in combating corruption.
Many participants highlighted the need for a small Bank office in El Salvador to ensure
more regular communication and continuous dialogue and feedback on both projects and
analytical work, to improve coordination and reduce duplication with other members of
the international community and to enhance partnerships with local stakeholders.
Members of Congress
Members of Congress representing all political parties agreed on the urgent need to
reactivate economic growth and to increase tax revenues to finance basic social and
infrastructure investments, while addressing the institutional weaknesses affecting
government agencies. Many “diputados” and leaders of some political parties expressed
concern about the recent increase and costs of external debt, and requested the Bank to
provide technical assistance to the Government to develop an external debt management
strategy. On the fiscal side, legislators from the opposition parties expressed their views
about the need to adopt a package of fiscal reforms that goes beyond improved tax
administration, introducing new taxes to promote equity and increase revenues to finance
social and growth related expenditures. They also emphasized the need to build
consensus in support of fiscal reform. Other issues that were given priority by
“diputados” from the opposition include: dollarization, the situation of the agricultural
sector and the potential adverse effects of CAFTA, migration and family remittances.
Members of Congress and the Bank mission discussed the approval and ratification
process of new loans, and some delays experienced in past loans. Some key comments

4

made include: (i) congress would like to be involved in the substance of the loans and
their contribution to existing policies; (ii) approval could be facilitated by improved
information flows between the Executive and the Legislative during the process of
project preparation; (iii) contacts between Bank teams responsible for project preparation
and the relevant congressional commissions to inform about future projects early in the
preparation cycle could contribute to reduced delays in Congressional approval.
During the conversation, Members of Congress mentioned other issues currently in the
legislative and/or political agenda: (i) electoral reform, including campaign financing
and the role of the media, (ii) competition and consumer protection, (iii) the organization
of new political parties and the need to reduce the risk of polarization. Some “Diputados”
expressed interest in the World Bank Institute’s activities in support of parliaments,
especially those related to strengthening parliaments’ capacity to oversee the allocation
and use of public funds as well as the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank.
Private Sector
The Bank mission met with representatives of different private sector groups, including
those associated with FDI firms, large local investors, as well as SMEs. Messages were
consistent even though emphases differ across groups. In general, private sector
representatives express their satisfaction about the Bank’s increased presence in El
Salvador, both in policy dialogue as well as with new lending and technical assistance.
The country, according to the private sector, is well-positioned to deal with future
challenges because of its stable macroeconomic and financial environment, increased
FDI flows and family remittances, and important changes in the political area. New
parties are emerging that could lead to less polarization and the strengthening of
democracy. Major concerns of the private sector include: restoring growth, reducing
poverty in sustainable ways, providing incentives that allow for more productive use of
remittances, having clear and strong leadership from the Executive on economic policy.
Private sector representatives mentioned other problems that require immediate and
urgent actions: crime and violence, employment generation, health reform, urban
transport, and the water sector.
CAFTA has all the support of the private sector even though there are concerns about the
country’s readiness to compete and succeed under the new scenario and rules. The
Government of President Saca is recognized by the private sector for its more
participatory style but some suggestions for improving outcomes were made. Most
importantly, the private sector considers that consensus building should focus on “how to
grow”, “how to finance growth” and finally “how to improve the international image of
El Salvador”.
