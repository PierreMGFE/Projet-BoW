Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.
The Board endorsed the first CAS for Rwanda on April 7, 1998. This was followed by a
discussion and the endorsement by the Board of a CAS Progress Report on June 29, 1999, in a context
of conflict in the Great Lakes Region, with the active military involvement of Rwanda in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and discussions on a peace process spearheaded by the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity. Rwanda was also involved in a wide-ranging program of
economic and socio-political reform, including the planning for a transition to an elected government.
There has been progress in the resolution of the regional conflicts and the implementation of the
domestic reform/change programs.
2.
The Peace process: The main belligerents in the war in the DRC signed the Lusaka Peace
Accord, including a ceasefire, in August 1999 but implementation started in 2001. The cease-fire was
largely observed, although with sporadic reports of fighting primarily in Eastern DRC, and the principal
non-regional countries involved in the war gradually withdrew from the fighting. The last year
witnessed a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the war. The recent bilateral agreement between the DRC
and Rwanda on July 30, 2002, a result of these efforts, has given a needed boost to the implementation
of the Lusaka Accord. It clarified the path to peace by defining the responsibilities of the DRC and
Rwanda and the role of the United Nations and South Africa, the principal mediators, and establishing a
timetable for action. Uganda and the DRC also signed a bilateral agreement in early September 2002 in
Luanda. The withdrawal of Rwandan troops from the DRC, which commenced with a contingent of
about 1300 soldiers in mid-September 2002, was completed on October 5, 2002. In Burundi, an
inclusive transitional government was established in November 2001 but two splinter rebel groups have
continued to fight. Discussions for a ceasefire are continuing. The prospects for peace in the Great Lakes
region are better now than anytime in the last ten years.
3.
The disarmament of fighters from irregular armed groups based in the DRC, including those of
Rwandan origin, and the integration of these ex-fighters into communities in their countries of origin are
major challenges to the peace process in the region. The Greater Great Lakes Multi-country
Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP), launched with Bank funding and technical
support, and supported by many donors, is an important instrument in this process. Under this
framework, Rwanda is already implementing a demobilization and reintegration of Rwanda Defense
Force soldiers as well as ex-fighters from armed groups. This program started in April 2002.
4.
Institutional reforms: In Rwanda, a number of important institutional reform efforts are at the
implementation stage. The decentralization of government became operational following local elections
in March 2001. The gacaca system for the accelerated resolution of the cases of the genocide suspects,
started pilot operations in June 2002. The Legal and Constitutional Commission is holding consultations
on a new constitution for Rwanda that will pave the way for national elections in 2003. Rwanda
launched its National Poverty Reduction Program in June 2000 and completed a full PRSP in June 2002,
following extensive national consultations. The Boards of the IMF and the Bank discussed the PRSP in
late July and early August 2002 respectively, and concluded that the PRSP provides a sound basis for
concessional assistance and debt relief. Implementation of the PRSP has already started.
5.
The PRSP priorities: The PRSP sets out the Government's vision and strategies for peace,
national security and reconciliation, private sector-led growth and rapid poverty reduction, and identifies
the transformation of agriculture and the rural economy as the principal source of growth in the
-v

medium-term and an imperative for poverty reduction. Furthermore, the PRSP regards good
governance, human development, macroeconomic stability and partnership between the Government,
civil society, the private sector and the donor conmmunity as the key elements in its proposed approach to
attacking poverty in Rwanda. It identifies prioritization of public actions, sectoral strategy development,
and the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as the key instruments for focusing public
actions on poverty reduction and improving the effectiveness of these actions. The PRSP identified six
broad priority areas: (i) rural development and agricultural transformation; (ii) human development; (iii)
economic infrastructure; (iv) good governance; (v) private sector development; and (vi) institutional
capacity building. It compiled a matrix of policy actions for each of these areas, and proposed specific
budget priority programs in each area.
6.
The CAS themes: This CAS reviews recent developments and challenges facing Rwanda,
examines the Government's strategies and policies in the PRSP for dealing with these challenges, and
sets out a Bank assistance program for the country consistent with the PRSP. It outlines four themes for
Bank support: (i) the revitalization of the rural economy; (ii) private sector development and
employment creation; (iii) human and social development and (iv) improvement in governance and the
effectiveness of public sector actions. Bank support will be through a mix of lending and advisory
services, working in partnership with the Government and other development agencies. The CAS
recognizes that, at this stage in its transition from conflict to development, Rwanda needs to establish a
sound analytical basis for development strategies and programs. It therefore proposes greater emphasis
on economic and sector work by the Bank.
7.
Lending scenarios and programs: The base case IDA lending and grants in the CAS, in the
range of US$250-3 17 million for FY03-05 (see Table 3), is targeted on the priorities of the PRSP. The
lower level of the range is constrained by the amount of lending that respects long-term debt
sustainability concerns while the higher end is the IDA allocation to Rwanda determined through the
IDA performance based allocation process. A proposed high case also targets these priorities and is
linked to rapid progress in the implementation of the PRSP and the prospects for peace and cooperation
in the Great Lakes region. The additional assistance of the high case would therefore address regional
infrastructure and institutional development issues that are critical to the development of Rwanda.
8.
Lending in the high end of the range in base case as well as the high case is predicated on
international actions to address the debt sustainability problems of Rwanda and other countries in
similar circumstances. Despite the debt sustainability concerns, the high case is essential as a
performance incentive for Rwanda and a signal to other partners for enhanced assistance in the context
of exceptional performance. Should debt sustainability concerns constrain IDA from providing
additional resources in the high case or from continuing to provide support when exogenous shocks lead
to a deterioration of debt sustainability indicators, IDA would approach the donors for enhanced grant
assistance.
9.
On the other hand, the escalation of conflict in the region, and the lack of progress in
implementing the PRSP and the socio-economic reform program would trigger a low case. In the low
case, portfolio implementation and lending would focus on those interventions in the base case program
that directly benefit the poor. The lending program would be US$80 million over 3 years.
10.
The proposed Institutional Reform Credit (IRC) is designed to support the Government's reform
program that underpins the PRSP. The IRC, which is being presented to the Board with this CAS, will
support reforms in (i) public expenditure management including the implementation of the MTEF, and
public financial management, (ii) private sector development including privatization and the reform of
the financial sector; and (iii) gender and budget related institutional issues in the area of human
development.

-vi-

11.
IDA grants: Under the IDA 13 Grants program approved by the Board on July 25, 2002,
Rwanda as a debt vulnerable IDA-only low-income country is eligible to have part of its IDA allocation
as grants. The allocation of grants to Rwanda for FY03 amounts to SDR37.8 million (US$49.8 million).
The CAS proposes that the grants be used to fully fund the HIV/AIDs and the community development
projects, and partially fund the capacity building project. The grant allocations for FY04 and FY05 will
fund programs in health, education and water supply in the planned PRSCs, as well as the rural
infrastructure and urban water and sanitation components of the planned project for road rehabilitation
and maintenance, and urban infrastructure.
12.
Debt sustainability: Rwanda has been receiving interim assistance under the Enhanced HIPC
since December 2000. Its completion point is planned for mid-2003. Rwanda's debt sustainability
indicators have significantly worsened due to the deterioration of the prices of its major export
commodities (tea, coffee, and coltan). This development underlines the significant risks to debt
sustainability and the need to closely monitor its evolution. If the trends in the external sector continue,
the net present value of debt/exports ratio (NPVRs) would likely remain above the levels projected in
the Decision Point document, requiring the contraction of external borrowing and significant shifting
into grants, if available. As Rwanda's borrowing is on concessional terms from multilaterals including
IDA, this would imply up to a 50 percent reduction in IDA disbursements from the US$50-60 million
per year in recent years and a cutback in the planned IDA lending program in the CAS, derived from the
IDA performance based resource allocation process.
13.
The PRSP identifies export production as an important source of growth and the transformation
of the economy. Exports declined in the period of civil war and genocide and currently, the ratio of
exports to GDP is one of the lowest in the world and about half of what it was in the 1980s. A strong
recovery of exports is important for growth and for ensuring that Rwanda will meet its external
financing needs in a sustainable manner. However, Rwanda's transition from conflict to peace and
development and the implementation of the ambitious agenda in the PRSP requires substantial support
from its development partners including actions to alleviate the concerns over debt sustainability. The
prospect of converting part of the IDA13 lending envelope into grants for low income countries with
long-term debt sustainability problems helps to allay some of these concerns.
14.
Additional actions including possible consideration of additional debt relief at Completion Point
of the Enhanced HIPC, and higher and predictable flows of grants from donors would be important to
bring the NPVRs closer to those projected in the Decision Point Debt Sustainability Analysis. The range
of IDA assistance proposed in the CAS gives the Bank the flexibility to limit lending commitments to
the low end of the proposed assistance program to avoid the deterioration of debt sustainability
indicators. However, this would need to be accompanied by increased donor grants to ensure adequate
resources for the implementation of the PRSP. The possible topping up of the Enhanced HIPC would
reduce the risks to debt sustainability and provide IDA greater flexibility to adjust the level of assistance
in response to performance and to continue to provide assistance if exogenous shocks were to reduce
export earnings and lead to the deterioration of debt sustainability indicators.
Conclusion
15.
Rwanda has managed the transition from the genocide to peace and development well. It
developed solutions to its difficult problems through a process of dialogue, consultation and
participation. Accordingly, Rwanda embraced the PRSP that, through its process of intensive
consultations, provides a comprehensive diagnosis of poverty and spells out a sound strategy and actions
to attack poverty. Support by the Bank and international community for the implementation of the
poverty reduction strategy is essential for reducing poverty, thus helping to strengthen the foundations
for sustained peace and mitigate the risks of conflict in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region.

Issues for Board Discussion
16.

The Board may wish to discuss the following issues:
a The CAS has proposed a range of lending amounts, with actual lending dependent on the levels of
grants from the donors and the actions taken to mitigate the risks to debt sustainability. Directors
might wish to comment on how to balance the concerns over debt sustainability with the risks of
possible underfunding of the program implied by debt sustainability requirements.
a Directors might wish to comment on the use of the proposed high case as a perfomiance signaling
mechanism for higher grants by others rather than a case for higher IDA lending.

COUNTRY BACKGROUND

Introduction
1.
Rwanda continues to face complex socioeconomic problems stemming from genocide and preceding
conflicts. The per capita income, at US$220 in 2001, is still much lower than the US$370 in 1990 and Rwanda
remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Sixty percent of the households live below the poverty line,
compared to about 40 percent in 1985. Rwanda's population of 8.5 million in 2000, is growing at between 2.5 - 2.9
percent per annum. Its population density
of 337 per kma2 in 1999 is in the top ten in

Legacies of the genocide and past civil strife
3.
Economic and social impovershment: The legacies of the genocide continue to weigh heavily on the
social and economic recovery of the country. The genocide and the preceding civil conflicts impoverished
Rwandese and increased their vulnerability, particularly the widows and orphans of the genocide, recently retuned
refugees, resettled internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the families of the detained 120,000 suspects of crimes of
genocide. In 2000, 40 percent of children between the ages of 7-14 were orphans (have lost at least one parent).
Mental health problems, largely the result of the horrors of the genocide and its aftermath, are widespread in a
society that is not equipped to deal with it. A 1995 UNICEF survey of children found that 96 percent witnessed
violence during the genocide, 88 percent saw dead bodies or parts of bodies, and 70 percent witnessed someone
being killed or injured. A recent survey of the population found that poverty/economic hardship, security,

healthcare, and lack of trust/smcenty as the major social problems. The loss of the social capital and conmunity
solidarity that help to cope with poverty has increased social and economic vulnerability. The rebuilding of the
social fabric will take time; continued assistance to reintegrate the vulnerable populations and the rapid expansion of
economic opportunities will accelerate the process.
4.
Conflict in the Great Laks region: Rwanda's involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), is one of the legacies of the genocide. The presence of the forces that perpetrated the genocide (the
interahamwe) in eastern DRC engendered insecurity on both sides of the border. In 1997-98, these forces regularly
infiltrated into Rwanda and committed acts of violence. At its peak, this insurgency resulted in the killing of
hundreds of civilians and the displacement of over six hundred thousand people. Rwanda insists that the second
round of military intervention in the DRC was to neutralize this security threat This round of intervention however
deteriorated into a broader war, involving the regime in Kinshasa and three rebel Congolese movements, up to seven
African countries, and a number of ethnically-based irregular fighting groups ("negative forces') including the
interahamwe. The conflict in the region, now in its fifth year, has cost over 2 million lives, diverted scarce human
and financial resources from development and undermined legitimate regional trade and commerce. The reports of
the UN Panels of Experts (2001, 2002) have chronicled the diversion of the resources of the DRC by all the
combatants to support the war effort and concluded that these resources were sustaining and prolonging the conflict
5.
Deforestion and Natural Resource Degradaton: The downward spiral of land degradation, set in
motion many years ago by demographic pressure, was exacerbated by the civil war and genocide. The massive
displacement and resettlement of the population and the movements of fighting forces accelerated deforestation and
environmental degradation, and the neglect and lack of maintenance dunng the crisis led to the deterioration of
environmental infiastructure. A pre-1994 total forest area of 417,000 ha has fallen to approximately 226,000 ha.
Gishwati Forest has all but disappeared, the Mutara hunting reserve has completely disappeared and the Akagera
National Park is now less than one-third of its original size. Rwanda is at an elevation between 1,000 and 4,500
meters. Farning often takes place on slopes and with few exceptions (e.g., the central plateau), the soils of the
highlands are of volcanic origin and thus relatively fertile but fragile. Hence, the removal of vegetation and the
neglect of the mfrastucture for physical and biological soil conservation accelerated soil erosion and according to
recent estimates, half of the country's ftnmland suffers from moderate to severe erosion. The depletion of the
organic matter and fertlity has resulted in low crop yields. Other environmental and economic costs of land
degradation include the loss of habitats and biodiversity, degradation of water quality in rivers, lakes, and
marshlands (through sediment loads, pollution from agricultnual inputs, and siltation), and floods and landslides.
6.
Financialburdens: Rwanda's stock of external debt rose rapidly from US$366 million in 1985 to US$913
million in 1993, and the intemal public debt rose from US$142 million to US$367 million during the same period.
The capital accumulated with these loans was subsequently destroyed in the civil war and genocide. Debt relief in
end-2000 from the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (eHIPC) Initiative has reduced the burden of
external debt but the burden of internal public debt (at market interest rates and relatively short maturity compared to
extemal debt), remains onerous. Public payments anears in 2000 amounted to about 4 percent of GDP and included
claims on the GoR for contracts made before the genocide and dunng the emergencies in 1994-98. The banking
sector is saddled with non-performing loans (NPL), with about 30 percent of the portfolio classified as NPLs. These
legacy debts, anrears, and non-performing loans constitute a drag on economic recovery.
7.
Loss of Human Resources: The largest loss of the genocide was in human resources, with close to a
million people killed, two million driven into exile, over a hundred thousand in prison, and thousands handicapped
physically and mentally. The professional and technically skilled people (doctors, teachers, nurses, etc) were singled
out for killing in the genocide. While the majority of the refugees have retumed, the educated and qualified among
them have largely remained in exile. About 800,000 exiled Rwandese, refugees or descendants of refugees from the
ethnic violence of 1959, 1962 and 1973-74 returned to Rwanda after the genocide, bringing with them new skills
and cultures. However, these new skills of these old case load refugees do not fully compensate for those lost and,
I

In 2001, theAock of extmal debt was US$13 billion or 7pcent of GDP.

besides, the evolution of the mix of cultures to produce productive teams will take time. The severe shortage of
skilled people cosrains economic growth and social change. Rwanda has to make significant investments to make
up the losses.
Recent Developments in the Socio-Political Transition
8.
Funcdoning of dhe Insdtuons for Poliical Trnsition: The Arusha Accord provided the framework for
the formation of a coalition Govermment of National Unity and the National Assembly of the Transition in 1994. All
the political paries that existed in the country in 1993, except the party in power during the genocide, were
represented in the coalition. These transitional anrangements will end in 2003, when elections for a democratic
govenrnent at the national level are to take place. To this end, consultations on the new constitution started in 2000
and the constitutional proposals from the drafling committee will be subject to approval by the National Assembly
and a national referendum Meanwhile, the coalition anrangement has been increasingly fragile, with the RPF
exercising a dominant role while the other large party - the Mouvement Democraticdu Rwanda (MDR), has been
beset with internal tensions and crisis. In 2001, the ex-President Bizimungu attempted to launch a new political
party, and since then, he and some of his supporters have been subjected to arrests and detention.
9.
Since 1994, Rwandese have considered national dialogue a prerequisite for national reconciliation, durable
peace, security and sustainable development The countrywide dialogue on national unity in Rwanda, initiated by
the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (URC), identified poor justice, govemance and leadership, and
poverty as the major obstacles to national unity. These consultations gave irpetus to the efforts to reform the
economy, and put in place institutions to foster good governance, including the decentralization of govenmment and
a new approach to accelerate the trials of the over 100, 000 detained genocide suspects. The National Assembly
adopted a decentralization law in 2000 and on March 6, 2001, elections for councils of new district administrations
were held and the decentralized entities came into being thafter. The trials of the genocide suspects started in
1997 but proceeded slowly with only about 2,500 cases fully processed by end 1999. In end-2000, the National
Assembly adopted legislation for the use of a traditional participatory method of justice (Gacaca)to accelerate the
trials. Elections for Gacacajurors took place in October 2001 and the process started in June 2002.
Recent Developments in Human and Social Development
10.
The rapid and permanent resettlement of groups displaced by the genocide has facilitated the socioeconomic recovery and the efforts to rebuild the social fabric. However, eight years after the genocide, Rwanda
continues to grapple with the resettlement and reintegration of refugees and displaced people, but with diminishing
assistance from the international community. With the progress in the Lusaka Accord, more Rwandese, including
ex-combatants will need to be resettled and reintegrated. Rwanda has made significant progress in improving social
services, reducing gender disparities and initiating a serious effort on attacldng IiV/AIDS. Enrolment has increased
at all levels of education, primary and secondary school net and gross enrolments have surpassed pre-genocide
levels, and the enrolment of girls is at par with that of boys. Health facilities have been rehabilitated through the
combined efforts of the GoR, local and foreign NGOs, official development partners and relief agencies. However,
the user fees in the decenthalized health management system have constrained access. In November 1999, the civil
code was amended to give women the right to inherit and own property. Seats are reserved for women in elected
local committees/councils and in the National Assembly. A comprehensive five-year Gender Action Plan was
adopted in 2000 and a detailed Legal Action Plan to eliminate gender disparities has been developed in consultation
with the civil society. The culture of silence on HI V/AZDS has been broken and the epidemic has become a subject
of open public discussion. The Government has adopted a multi-sectoral approach to fighting HIV/AIDS and a new
national commission has been created to spearhead the effort.
Recent Economic Developments
11.
Economic opportunilies are very limited in Rwanda The vast majority of the labor force, 97 percent of the
female and 86 percent of the male are involved in agriculture, not by choice but by the absence of choice. In 2000,
agriculture contributed 41 percent of GDP, industry 20 percent, with services, principally wholesale and retail trade,

4

transportation and public administration, contnbuting the remaminng 39 percent The structure of production has not
changed significantly over time as m 1990 agnculture contnbuted 44 percent of GDP and industry 24.3 percent.
Agriculture remains largely subsistence and average farm sizes have progressively declined due to population
pressure. The decline in agncultural productivity, the disruptions due to conflicts, and the high population growth
rate has made Rwanda highly dependent on food aid.
12.
Real GDP fell by 50 percent and the rate of inflation rose to 64 percent in the 1994. Subsequently, the
economy rebounded, growing by 70 percent in 1994-97 and 8.9 percent in 1998. In 1999-2001, the real GDP
continued to grow, by 7.6 percent in 1999, 6.0 percent in 2000, and 6.7 percent in 2001. Agriculture and
construction were the main sources of growth in 1998-2001 as the decline of intemational relief efforts adversely
affected the manufacturng and service sectors. In 2000, real GDP attained its aggregate 1990 value. The 1990s was
effectively a lost decade. On the assumnption that the economy would have grown at a modest 4 percent per annum
in 1990-2000 without the war and genocide, real GDP would be higher by 42 percent and GDP per capita by 22
percent in 2000.
13.
The inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CP), fell from an average of 6.8 percent in
1998 to -2.4 percent in 1999, reflecting a decline in food prices in 1999. It rose moderately by 3.9 percent in 2000
and 3.5 percent in 2001, notwithstanding the pressure from higher food prices and fuel costs, and the rapid
depreciation of the exchange

percent of GDP in 2001, with imports nmning at 15 percent. Between 1990 and 2000, the prices of tea and coffee in

Rwanda: County Assistance Sbategy

5

world markets declined by 6.4 percent and 20.7 percent respectively in real dollar terms. Export volumes,
particularly for coffee also declined and the instability in the country undermined the development of promismg
high value horticultural exports. Exports rceived a boost in 2001 with the addition of US$41 million from coltan
exports but the price of coltan collapsed during the course of that year. Inports also declined during 1997-2000 (see
Table 2) due to the reductions in humanitarian assistance by relief agencies and NGOs. The current account deficit,
excluding official transfers, has remained above 16 percent of GDP while the gross intemational reserves have been
maintained close to 6 months of imports. Official development assistance (ODA) was US$25 per capita in 2001 and
ODA financed 61 percent ofpublic spending.
16.
Publc Expendiwu: Since 1990, security-related expenditures have been dominant in Rwanda's public
spending due to intemal conflicts and recently to the military involvement in the DRC. Security related spending
(for the army and the gendarnerie), as a proportion of GDP rose from a low of 1.59 percent of GDP in 1985 to 3.7
percent in 1990, reaching a peak of 6.3 percent in 1992. After the genocide, security related spending declined from
5.2 percent in 1996 to 4.3 percent in 1998 and 4.2 percent in 1999, comprising 3.7 percent of GDP for the army and
0.5 percent of GDP for police duties. 2 From 2000, the budget for the police was separated from the military budget
The decline in security/military expenditures as a proportion of GDP to 3.4 percent in 2000 and 3.3 percent in 2001
reflects this separation as well as the slowing of the increase in nilitary expenditures. The share of mblitary
expenditures in govemment recunt expenditures has declined from 36 percent in 1998 to 24 percent in 2001.
Nevertheless, concems rmained about off-budget military spending, with doubts about Rwanda's ability to slow
down military spending while engaged in a war.
17.
In 1998, the GoR took the first steps at budget prioritization and treated the social sectors as budget
priorities, with increasing and ring-fenced budget allocations. As a result, recurrent expenditures on the social sectors
have risen from 24 percent of total recurrnt expenditures in 1998 to 38 percent in 2001. For the 2001 budget, an
expanded list of poverty-focused programs, drawn up from the discussions of the interim PRSP, was treated as
pnorities. The GoR introduced the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) approach to budgeting in 2000
for the 2001 budget This followed careful preparations involving the sensitization of the key stakeholders and
training for staff in the ministry of finance and line ministries. Monitorng of the budget spending has improved,
facilitated by the computerization of budget transactions.
18.
Pocy and InstutonalReforms: The GoR's program of change in Rwanda underlined that a strong
economic revival, with robust private sector growth, was a necessary element of the effort on national reconciliation.
The GoR has therefore been strongly corrmitted to the reform the economy and related institutions to build the
foundation for sustained private sector-led growth. Since 1997, the Govemnent has undertaken policy and
institutional reforms in areas of trade and the exchange regime, revenue mobiization and public expenditures, public
administrtion and public enteprise reform The Bank the IMF, the AfDB and bilateral donors supported these
reforms. Box 9, Annex 2, shows the key reforms taken in 1997-2001.

The PRSP Process
19.
In June 2000, the GoR launched its PRSP process and established a permanent institutional framework for
the preparation and implementation of the PRSP, building on the existing organs created for the economic reform
program. The Ministerial Conmission for Reform was transformed into a Commnission for Poverty Reduction,
chaired by the Prime Minister and consistig of key ministers, the Governor of the central bank and the vice
president of the National Assembly. The role of this commission was to provide guidance to the poverty reduction
program and associated reform processes. A new Steering Conmittee for Poverty Reduction included secretarygenerals of key ministries, the first vice-govemor of the central bank, and representatives of NGOs and donors. The

National Poverty Reduction Program (PNRP), headed by a coordinator, was established to cany out the technical
work of preparing the PRSP, including organizing the consultations, monitoring the progress in the reform program
and gearing up to monitor poverty reduction.
20.
The PRSP process was facilitated by the strong support provided by the bilateral donors, the UNDP, the
Bank and the 1MF. The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (iPRSP) was presented to the Boards of
Executive Directors of the World Bank and the IMF in December 2000. In November 2001, Rwanda presented its
draft full PRSP to the donor cormunity at a GoR/Donor partners Conference in Kigali. The donors commended the
PRSP process and the poverty reduction strategy in the draft document. The full PRSP was completed in June 2002

and discussed by the IMF Board on July24, 2002, and the Board of the Bank on August 8, 2002. With the
completion of the first PRSP, attention has tumed to implementation and monitoring. Thus, the PNRP has been
transformed into a Strategic Planning and Poverty Monitoring Department (SPMMD) of the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning, with the added responsibility for assisting various levels of government in developing their
strategies and plaming processes.
Characteriscs of Poverty in Rwrda
21.
The PRSP benefited from a number of recent surveys completed in 2000 and 2001, including the
Household Living Standards Survey (HLSS), the smaller Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), and the
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). These surveys and the consultations of the PRSP have produced a rich
database on the socio-econonic conditions in Rwanda, sensitized the policymakers and the population on poverty
related issues and established the basis for building a constituency for the war on poverty. The surveys and the
intensive consultations of the PRSP, including national rapid poverty assessments (NPAs) at grassroots levels, as
well as the policy relevance tests, facilitated the elaboration of the PRSP's poverty reduction strategy. The PRSP
process in Rwanda was unique in its recognition of traditional problem solving processes and the integration of these
processes into the national poverty reduction progranm.
22.
The surveys and the NPAs confirmed what has been suspected - that living conditions in Rwanda, while
slowly imnproving since 1994, continue to be very poor, particularly in the rural areas. A new definition of poverty
was established and a new poverty line created from the NPAs and the HLSS, establishing the headcount index at
60.3 percent below the poverty line. The HLSS showed a big change in income inequality, with the Gini-coefficient
rising to 0.455 from the 0.27 in the 1985 HLSS, and with urban populations doing much better than rural ones.
Seventy five percent of the households in Kigali were in the 5h (highest) expenditure quintile compared to 9 percent
in Kibuye. The increase in inequality reflects the relative neglect of the rral areas in the post-conflict reconstruction
process in Rwanda as external funding provided development and employment oppornities for urban dwellers but
primarily humnanitarian relief to nrual conmmunities. Box 1 outlines the nain characteristics ofpoverty in Rwanda.
23.
The PRSP assessed the nature and causes of poverty in Rwanda and concluded that it stems from the
legacies of the genocide and the unwillingness of past governments to tackle the long-term structual constraints.
The PRSP noted that the genocide depleted the human resources, created large numbers of vulnerable households,
traumatized people and a large prison population, destroyed household capital stockl particularly housing and
livestock Thus, the genocide impovenshed the population and accentuated the obstacles for economic growth.

The PRSP aims to reduce poverty to less than half the 2001 level by 2015 and improve social indicators in
line with the UN Millemiumn Development Goals (MDGs). Its growth/poverty reduction strategy (PRS) has the
pnvate sector as the main engine of growth and the transfonmation of agriculture and the niral economy as necessaxy
to kick-start the transformation of the overall economy and the leading source of growth in the medium-term. To
deal with the legacies of genocide and the structural impediments to economic transfonnation, the PRSP (i) outlines
the basic building blocks for economic growth and poverty reduction as macroeconomic stability, human
development, good govemance, partnership and the pnoritization of public actions; (ii)identifies rural development
and agricultural transformation as the highest priority for public actions; (iii) identifies five other areas as priorities
for public actions - good govemance, human development, pnvate sector development; economic infrastructure,
and institutional capacity building, and (iv) stresses the importance of sectoral strategies and the MTEF and the
effectiveness of public actions in the implementation of the PRSP. Box 2 summarizes the joint staff assessment of
the PRSP.
11m. GOVERNMENT'S POVERTY REDUCrION STRATEGY
A.

NATIONAL VISION AND GOALS

25.
Since 1998, the Rwandese have discussed the development challenges, most prominently through the
Urugwiro Village Meetings, the consultations of the National Unity and Reconciliation Conmmission (UJRC), and
most recently, the PRSP. 3 These discussions facilitated the articulation of a long-term vision for Rwanda (Vision
2020), and agreement on a transition program to a democratic govemment and to develop a strategy to reduce
poverty. Vision 2020 was conceived to provide the basis for a new start to build peace and prospenty in society in
the 21st century. It aims to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and move Rwanda out of
underdevelopment and poverty. Its targets include a GDP per capita of US$900, from the US$230 in 2000, a
reduction in the incidence of poverty fromn 60 percent to 25 percent; an increase in life expectancy to 65 years from
the current 49 years, and an increase in literacy from 48 percent to 90 percent The Vision 2020 regards national
reconciliation, domestic and regional secuity, good govemance and economic transformation as the key
overarching challenges to achieving these ambitious goals.
National Unity and Reconcidiation

26.
National dialogue, resettlement and reintegration of victims of genocide including refugees and IDPs,
poverty reduction, good govemance, and the adjudication of the cases of the genocide suspects have been
recognized as prerequisites to national reconciliation. The Commission for National Unity and Reconciliation
(URC) has the responsibility for promoting national participatory dialogue (See Box 6, Armex 1). Dialogue under
the URC and the PRSP process have helped to sharpen the likages between the different challenges faced by the
country, build consensus on strategies and actions, and monitor and evaluate results from actions taken. The URC
has also been engaged in receiving returning refugees, educating them on developments in Rwanda, and facilitating
their reintegration into communities.
National Security, Regional Stabilit and Cooperation
27.
Rwanda's strong historical, social, geographic and economic links with the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and Burundi make it unlikely that it can achieve peace and security without the resolution of the conflicts in
these neighboring countries. The commitments expressed in early 2001 by the principal belligerents in the DRC war
to implement the Lusaka Accord and the installation of a broad-based transition govemment in Burundi in
November 2001 generated optimism for peace and stability in the region. However actual progress was limited and

society leaden; The nrneings took place every Satuday, for close to one year, and focussed on findig the way fom-ard on the sociopoEtical and economic challenges acing Rwanda

Rwanda: Counby Assistance Sbtat

besides, Rwanda's relations with Uganda that deteriorated in 2000 have yet to be permanently mended, despite the
mediation efforts by their conmmon international friends. The prospects for peace have improved recently. The
agreement between the governments of Rwanda and the DRC, signed on July 30, 2002 in Pretoria, on the
dismantling of the forces of the interahamwe and the ex-FAR and the withdrawal of the Rwandan forces from DRC,
has reinvigorated the Lusaka peace process. Further, Rwanda and Uganda are continuing their efforts to rebuild the
confidence and tnist between them, with contacts at all levels between Ugandans and Rwandese.
Good Governance
28.
Consultations undertaken in Rwanda since 1998 underlined the role of poor govemance in the tragic
history of the country. As noted above (paragraph 24), the PRSP identified good governance as one of the key
foundations for economic growth and poverty reduction and consequently one of the six thematic prionties for
public action. The key challenges to good govemance in Rwanda are: national reconciliation; political legitimacy
with popular political participation; justice and human rights; and transparency and accountability in public actions.
National reconciliation (discussed above in paragraph 26) and good govemance are inextricably related. Without
an end to the mentality of exclusion and impunity, and an acceptance by all social groups that development is
possible only if they all worked together toward commnon goals, good governance would be out of the question. The
task of the URC is to build this inclusive culture. On the other hand, national reconciliation is not sustainable without
good governance. On poUtical legitimacy and participation, decentralizationof the state, introduced in 2001, was
designed to encourage grassroots democracy and broad participation in decision-making, and to foster
accountability and transparency at all levels of government (see Annex 1, Box 7). With decentralization, the local
authorities will be accountable to the people in the districts and not to the central government in Kigali. National
parliamentwy and presidential elections, previously planned for before end-1999, are due by end-2003. It is
important that the deadline of end 2003 be met and the process be totally transparent to ensure the legitimacy of the
government that is elected.
29.
The imnmediate challenge in the area of justice and human rights is the adjudication of the cases of the
over 100,000 genocide suspects in jail. The Gacacaprocess (Annex 1, Box 8) was adopted to deal expeditiously
with the cases of over 80 percent of the suspects. The Human Rights Commission, established in 1998, has so far
performed admirably but the challenge is huge. One of the key challenges is to educate the population and in
particular the public servants, the police and the nilitary on their responsibilities in the observance of human rights.
The PRSP reaffirmed the GoR's cormmitment to transparency and accountability. The actions envisaged include
(i) deepening the work of the Office of the Auditor General and the National Tender Board, (u) strengthening of
internal audits; (iii) taking action to rectify problems identified in public audits and in that regard strengthening
parliamentary scrutiny of audits; and (iv) public information on budget flows at all levels. The institutions for
internal auditing and financial reporting are being put into place. The Government has decided to establish the
Office of the Ombudsman to combat corruption and injustice.
Economic Transfonnation
30.
The events of 1994 mnade rapid economic growth and poverty reduction more challenging; nevertheless,
the GoR appears determined to meet challenge. Poverty reduction is regarded as a crucial element for social
reconciliation and stability. The ambitious poverty reduction targets in Vision 2020 would require a rapid
transformation of the economy to achieve a sustained 7-8 percent annual growth of GDP. Vision 2020 envisages
this transformation through the promotion of market-based agnculture, introduction of new technologies in the
nual/agricultural sector, an inclusive market-based private-sector-led economic system, and a specialization in
export-oriented light manufacturing and service industries, making full use of modem information and

MEDIUM-TERM ACTIONS TOWARDS POVERTY REDUCTION

31.
Rwanda is using the PRSP as the instrument to nmastm poverty reduction in the development agenda,
with poverty reduction defined in the broad sense of building the capacity of the population to meet the basic needs

of households and individuals including food, shelter, good health, knowledge, securty and social inclusion. For the
medium-term, the PRSP proposes prionty actions in six areas: rural development and agricultWal transformation,
human resource development; economic infastc , private sector development, govemance, and institutional
capacity building, to initiate this economic transformation and reduce poverty. These priorities reflect the results of
the extensive surveys and consultations undertaken to prepare the PRSP. For the purposes of the CAS discussion,
these priorities and associated actions are grouped in three themes: 4
1.

Accelerate efforts to increase the incomes of the population requiring actions to: (i) develop a
dynamic agriculture and the rnrl economy and renew and protect the natural resource base; (ii)
create employment and value through the promotion of private enterprise and its competitiveness;
and (iii) promote exports;

2.

Human development encompassing actions on (i) education and capacity building, (ii) health, (iii)
water and sanitation, (iv) fighting HIV/AIDS; and (v) social inclusion including empowering
women;

3.

Improve the effectiveness of the public sector to provide the enabling environment and public
services for sustainable econonic growth and poverty reduction. The key elements here are (i)
reorientation and institutional strengthening of government; (ii) transparency and accountability in
public affairs; (iii) effective management of public resources; (v) domestic resource mobilization
and (iv) partnership with the donor-community.
1.

Increasing the Incomes of the Population

32.
With poverty concentrated in runal areas and scarce land resources, raising agncultural productivity and
creating rural non-farm employment are crucial for increasing rural incomes. However, nral-urban migration is
increasing rapidly and urban private sector jobs are required to meet the demands of the increasing urban population.
Rwanda has high unemployrnent and under-employment, particularly among the youth. 5 It is estimated that about 1
million youths are unskilled and that their ranks rise by 10,000 a year, a problem with economic and socio-political
dimensions. Rwanda plans to use community-based public works in rural areas to create employment and improve
infiast
m and the environment with low-cost labor-intensive methods. Ultimately, rapid pnvate sector growth
will be required to create non-farm employment, increase incomes and take the pressure from the land
Developing a DynanicAgufture andRural Economy
The strategy for agriculture seeks to raise productivity through greater market-orientation of the sector,
33.
underpinned by intensification in input use, diversification and specialization in agncultural production. The strategy
emphasizes the rebuilding of the agricultural research and extension system, assistance to associations of farmers as
partners in the adoption and dissemination of new technology, the h1beralization of land, labor and agricultural inputs
and products markets, the rebuilding of the environmental protection infastucture, the improvement of credit and
the marketing systers, and the strengthening of the institutional framework and capacity to guide agricultural
development
34.
Renewing naiwrd resources: The reversal of the degradation of Rwanda's natwal resources as an
economic and environmental imperative. The PRSP outlined the priorities including the restoration of traditional
structures for water harvesting and terracing of hillsides; improved security of land tenure; promotion of the use of

A recent CWIQ suvey fowid that 83 pement of the population 15 years and older was econormcally active. About 12 percent of this
populaton was found to be imemployed or underemployed, with only I percent reported to be unemployed These results probably

organic and inorganic fertilizer, and preparation of a clear plan for the management of the marshlands. Other
proposals include the promotion of agro-forestry, the adoption of a policy to monitor and enhance private planting
and harvesting of trees, the comnunity management of forests and the adoption energy-efficient cooking
technology in the urban and rural areas. The GoR launched in 2000 a program of forestation to plant 65,000 hectares
of forests, mostly by community labor. It plans to use the rural public works scheme to rebuild the environmental
.ifistm .

35.
Restocking of ruralfarmers: The civil war and genocide led to dramatic reductions in household holdings
of livestock and small animals in almost every part of the country. The effect is a direct loss of income by the
farmers and the organic fertilizer for the soils. Restocking of livestock and small animals as well as access to
improved seeds and chemical fertilizer, are essential for rural economic recovery. The GoR intends to assist in the
restocking of rural capital through matching grants and credit to rural farmers.
36.
Creating Rural Employment. The PRSP regards the creation of non-agricultural jobs in rural areas as
central to rural poverty reduction. Thus, for the short-term, it proposes the generation of rural employment through
rural labor intensive public works programs focusing on critical areas of environmental protection (soil
conservation, wetland and watershed management, tenracing and bunding), and transport (rural feeder roads). It is
envisaged that communities will be involved in the identification of projects and program design.
P?vate Sector Dewveopment
37.
The Rwandan private sector is small and weak, as years of conflict and socio-political mismanagement
have driven away private investments. The PRSP identifies the energizng of the private sector as one of six
priorities for public actions. Policy and institutional reforms, improvements in infrastructure, adoption of new
technologies, promotion of exports and business development including small-scale enterprises, and regional
integration are essential to create a vigorous private sector in Rwanda.
38.
Structur Reforoms: Efforts will focus on consolidating and deepening the structural reforms initiated
in 1995-2000 to create the conditions conducive to private investments, competitiveness and creation of
employment, and promote exports and market based agriculture. Box 10, Annex 2 outlines the key reforms planned
for the medium term.
39.
Infrastuctr: Economic infrastrwture is one of the six priorities of the PRSP. Public actions in
infratructure aim to reduce costs, improve the reliability and coverage of services, and open up access to markets in
the country, the region and the rest of the world For transport, the policy objectives are to: (i) improve international
transport conmections; (ii) upgrade the key routes in the road network to paved standard to facilitate the countrys
access and its social and economic reintegration; (iii) improve mmal feeder roads to lower transport costs for farmers
and facilitate the development of market-based agriculture; (iv) ensure better mnanagement and financing of the
maintenance of the road network in general; and (v) irnprove road safety. Due to the high costs and unreliability of
existing arrangements for access to the sea, the GoR is considering a number of options to diversify access,
including a railway line from Kigali to the Tanzania Rail terminus at Issaka. Investments in transport infrastructure
will create constuction jobs and reduce youth unemployment in urban and rural areas.
40.
For energy, the strategy is to increase private sector involvement and competition in the provision of these
services to reduce costs and increase the availability of services. Preparations are underway for a phased introduction
of private sector participation, startng with the private management of existing publicly owned energy facilities.
Rwanda is seeking private investment for developing the methane gas reserves in Lake Kivu. On communications,
sound information and telecommunications infiastructure is essential for reducing costs of doing business and
enhancing private sector competitiveness and growth. The adoption of a new liberal telecommunications law and
the ongoing privatization of Rwandatel, the telephone monopoly, are the initial but important fundamental steps in
attracting private investment in the Information Communications and Technology (IC) infiastructure. A multisector utility regulator has been established to regulate utility firms. Investrments in water and sanitation
infiastructure would enhance private sector development in urban and rural areas.

12

Rwanda: Country Assistance Sbategy

41.
Adopting New Technologies to increaseProduclviy and Compettveness: The GoR has adopted a 5year (2001-2005) ICf plan. A National Information Technology Commission (NITC) and a Rwanda Inforration
Technology Authority (RITA) have been established to coordinate the implementation of ICT programs and
promote the process of leamting and capacity building towards the adoption of ICT in the public and private sectors.
Educational curricula and policies will put more emphasis on the teaching of science and technology in private and
public institutions. The Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management (KIST) was established in 1997 to
lead the effort in technology education and now offers practical and academic courses to full-time as well as parttime evening students. The GoR has been organizing a series of workshops/learning opportunities on technology
issues for the private and the public sectors and the civil society.
42.
Export Development: The PRSP identified production for exports as a key potential source of economic
growth and employment creation. The ratio of export of goods and non-factor services to GDP for Rwanda is very
low, and declined from 14.4 percent in 1980 to 8.3 percent in 2000. In contrast, the same ratio for SSA countries,
excluding Nigeria and South Africa, increased from 28 percent in 1980 to 33 percent in 2000. During Rwanda's
'lost decade" of the 1990s, exports declined in real terms at 1.8 percent per annum and curnently, exports are lower
in nominal dollar terms than 15 years ago. A strong recovery of exports is essential for sustaining the growth of the
economy and ensuring extemal debt sustainability. The scope exists to increase volume and quality of coffee and
tea, the traditional export commodities, and for the expansion of the exports of high value products such as cut
flowers, specialty coffees, pyrethum, fruits and vegetables. The liberalization of the marketing and privatization of
the tea and coffee processing plants will bring needed pnvate investments in the sector. Under pnvate management,
processing capacity is likely to expand and farmers would get the assistance needed to increase productivity and
raise quality. There is also the potential for mineral exports, principally coltan and other minor minerals such as
wolfram and casseterite. Rwanda is working to attract pnvate investors in textile manufacturing to take advantage of
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) of the United States. The GoR has contracted an American
consulting company specializing in competitiveness and the application of ICT to work with the private and public
sectors in developing competitive products for extenal markets. The Rwanda Investment Promotion Agency will
continue to promote alternative high-value smallholder crops but investments are needed to deal with the logistical
constraints.
43.
Regional Coopertion and Integradion: Regional markets are important for Rwanda to develop its private
sector and exports, particularly in view of its land-locked status. Peace in the region is a sine qua non for the
sustained access by Rwanda to these regional markets. Rwanda has expressed commitment to regional integration,
is a member of the Common Market for Eastem and Southem Africa (COMESA) and Economic Community of the
Countries of the Great Lakes (CEPGL), and participates in a number of regional initiatives such as the Nile Basin
Initiative and the Cross Border Initiative (CB1). Rwanda's application to join the Eastern Afica Cooperationcurrently consisting of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda-is still pending. Following the changes in the tariff code in
1999, Rwanda's trade regime became one of the most open in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rwanda is implementing a
phased elimination of import duties on goods originating from COMESA member countries, with a reduction of
duties by 80 percent in January 2002,90 percent by January 2003 and 100 percent by January 2004.
44.
Rwanda's export trade to the region, particularly to DRC, an important factor in the development of its
industrial sector in the 1960-1990 period, has declined due to the conflicts in the region. Apart from trade, other
potential benefits from cooperation with the other states in the region include energy development, including the
development of the methane gas reserves in Lake Kivu, and regional coordination in attracting tourists and
developing the tourism facilities in Uganda, DRC and Rwanda. There would also be synergies in battlingjointly, the
HIV/AIDS epidemic (a regional unit already exists) and the degradation of the natural resources in the region.
2.

Human and Social Development

45.
Rwanda recognizes that its future lies in developing and efficiently utilizing the capabilities of its people.
The PRSP's strategy for addressing Rwanda's formidable human and social development challenges is to combine
effective public actions by the central government with strong local and community involvement in problem
identification and solving, in partnership with the NGOs, the private sector and local govemments. The leadership of

Rwanda: Counry Assistance Sategy

13

the central govemment is crucial in promoting this partnership, through the development and implementation of
strategies and policies, effective delivery of social services, monitoring and regulation, and information, education
and communication on social sector issues. In this regard, the proposals of the PRSP to put prionty on mass
education and literacy and the education of girls, and to include HIV/AIDS issues and health education in the
cunculum in formal and informal education, are important instruments for improving welfare. In the medium-term,
the key issues on human development are health and education, the prevention, control and treatment of HIV/AIDS,
the elimination of gender disparities, the provision of humanitarian assistance and the reintegration of vulnerable
populations, returned refugees and ex-combatants.
ImprovngHealthServices
46.
Health problems rank very high among the problems faced by Rwandese. In the PRSP consultations, the
National Poverty Assessment (NPA) found health problems as the second most cited by respondents, after problems
in agriculture. Poverty is limiting access of the poor to health services while poor health is adversely affecting
productivity and deepening poverty. The GoR intends to strengthen the decentralized health management system,
increase health service coverage, develop and implement programs to fight the leading causes of mortality and
morbidity, particularly malaria, HIV/AIDS and malnutrition, strengthen human resources, and monitor key health
related indicators. Community participation, information sharing and education will continue to be used to
emphasize public hygiene and other preventive practices.
47.
The CWIQ survey found that the high cost of health services a strong deterent to the use of these services
and the GoR is exploring options for addressing this problem. A low cost mutual insurance scheme has been
introduced in some health districts that, if successful, would be replicated elsewhere. However, the insurance
premiums would have to be at levels affordable by poor households. The CWIQ survey also found that perceived
poor quality of health services was a deterrent to its use. Quality of services is linked to the scarcity of trained staff, a
problem that the GoR has started to address.
48.
Populanon and Reprodudive Healh Issues: The PRSP recognized the severity of the population
problem, the impact on the land, the environment and poverty, and the need for actions to slow population growth It
proposed to strengthen and improve access to reproductive health programs, formal and informal education of
women, and related LEC programs, and promote family planning programs, linking them closely with reproductive
health services. A population census is underway.
EnhaningAccess, Qualy andRelevance ofEducaion
49.
Rwanda is expenencing a significant rise in the demand for education at all levels, evidenced by the
increase in gross primary school enrolment from 89 percent in 1999 to 100 percent in 2001 and the explosion of feepaying part-time students in public and pnvate tertiary institutions. The key objectives for the sector are to achieve
Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 2010 and Education for All (EFA) by 2015, reduce the gender disparity in
education, improve the quality and relevance and expand adult non-fomal education. At pnmary and secondwy
levels, the emphasis will be on teacher training, curriculun development with emphasis on mathematics, science
and technology, books and instructional materials, reducing the high drop out and repetition rates in primry
schools, and the monitoring of quality improvements. Distance leaming facilities are being used to accelerate
teacher training. Non-fonnal education programs aim to improve functional literacy and raise awareness of the
population on topical issues such as reproductive and preventive health and HIV/AIDS prevention.
50.
The programs of the terary institutions will be re-oriented to meet the needs of the labor market, with
increasing emphasis on science, mathematics, management and technology. Tertiary education has absorbed a
disproportionate share of the national education budget due to cost of rehabilitating public institutions, expatriate
teachers, free board and tuition for students and scholarships for Rwandese to study abroad. A comprehensive
assessment of tertary education needs, to develop options for meeting these needs, is underway. Meanwhile, to
reduce the burden of higher education on the budget, the GoR has moved to discontinue the practice of providing

14

Rwanda: Country Assiance Stat

lodging and meals for all university students, started the progressive reduction of scholarships for overseas studies
and is introducing a student loan scheme in place of grants.
51.
GoR is developing, in collaboration with the key partners in the sector, a plan for EFA and the framework
for a sector-wide approach (SWAP) for meeting the challenges of the sector. The capacity of the Mnistry of
Education as well as those of the decentralized agencies responsible for education will need to be reinforced to
manage the ambitious developrnent agenda in the sector.
Improving Waler and Sanualion
52.
The Government's strategic franework for water supply in rural areas requires strong comnunity
participation in water delivery. The IDA rWal water project is based on this new strategy. For water supply in the
urban areas, the restructuring and pnvatization of the water/electricity utility will help to attract badly needed
investment and improve services. However, in the short and medium-term, public investment is needed to
rehabilitate the existing water works and improve services to consumers. For urban sanitation, the priority is to build
the institutional capacity of urban administrations to effectively manage sanitation services.
ControUling HIV/AlDS
53.
About 13.7 percent of the adults, between 15-49 years old, are infected with HIV/AIDS. The Government
is implementing a multi-sectoral F1IV/AIDS plan of action that involves various agencies from the private and
public sectors and the civil society. Rwanda is harnessing its social, political and religious structures in the fight
against H1V/AIDS. The National AIDS Control program will include specific activities targeted towards persons
infected with H[V or affected by HIV/AIDS as well as high-risk populations. The Government's strategy includes
an aggressive program of information, education and communications, testing and counseling, promotion of
protective methods and devices, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, prevention ofmother-child transmission,
care of people with AIDS, research and development, and regional collaboration in the campaign against
HIV/AIDs. An IDA credit under the Africa Region's MAP HIV/AIDS program will support the implementation of
the multi-sectoral strategy.
SocialInclusion
54.
Social exclusion has been at the root of Rwanda's tragic past. In addition to ethnic and economic exclusion,
women were marginalized in the society. Rwanda is addressing social exclusion issues in several of the ongoing
recovery and transition programs, and in policy and institutional reforms. The programs of resettlement and
reintegration, national reconciliation, decentralization and democratization, and the Gacaca all aim to build social
capital and aspire to maximum participation and inclusion of all groups in their activities. Social exclusion is also
being addressed through changes in laws and policies. Recently, the National Assembly passed a law outlawing all
ethiic, gender and other discrimination. The discussions under the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission
brought the problems of the Twa - the forgotten tribe of Rwanda - into public discussion and exposed their desperate
social and economic conditions. The areas of focus on social inclusion have been the resettlement and reintegration
of displaced people and vulnerable groups and the elimination of gender disparities. Rwanda has adopted new
legislation that outlawed forced labor and child labor and provided a framework for collective bargaining.
55.
Resefflement and Reintegration: The GoR developed a number of specific programs for vulnerable
groups to complement the assistance of relief agencies. The Government, by law, continues to allocate 5 percent of
its revenue to a program that assists the victims of the genocide. A demobilization and reintegration program was
initiated in 1997 and demobilized about 16,000 soldiers. Reintegration assistance was inadequate; this problem will
be addressed in the new program As the implementation of the Lusaka Accord advances in the coming years,
Rwanda will be challenged to reintegrate many retuming refugees including ex-combatants.
56.
Rwanda's controversial inidugudu (resettlement in grouped villages) program was intended to reduce
physical isolation and improve access to social services. However, the top-down approach of early programs, the
lack of involvement of communities in the planning of settlements and the absence of social services and means of

Rwanda: Country Assistance Sbteg

15

sustainable livelihoods in the new communities put the viability of the some of the villages in question. The program
will continue, with voluntary participation and community involvement in planning and implementation.
57.
Eliminating Gender Disparies:The Ministry of Gender and Women in Development (MIGEPROFE),
has forged a strong coalition with local women NGOs, to champion the integration of women into the development
process and give them a strong voice in the society. In addition to the reserved seats for women in the National
Assembly, seats are also reserved for elected women representatives in the local councils and their executive
committees. The challenge ahead is to eliminate all gender disparities from existing laws and tmanslate the legislation
into tangible institutional and cultural changes that make the laws effective. In this regard, the Government has
adopted the National Gender Plan of Action (2000-2005) and the Comprehensive Legal Action Plan for the
elimination of all gender dispanties. These plans were prepared with the full participation of key stakeholders and
the revision of existing laws and drafting new laws and regulations will follow the participatory approach. The Legal
Action Plan, with a clear roadmap for gender-responsive legal and judicial reform consistent with both the more
broad-based Gender Action Plan, will enable Rwanda to meet its obligations to the international conventions on the
rights of women.
58.
Core Labor Standards: The National Assembly adopted a revised Labor Code (Law No 51/2001) on
December 3, 2001 that forbid forced labor, the employmnent of children under 16 years of age, with some exceptions
for children between 14-16 years of age, eliminated the gender discrimination in the previous labor code, and
recognized the freedom of workers and employers to form/join trade unions and professional associations, the right
to collective bargaining and the obligations of workers and employers to abide by the agreements. Children between
14-16 years of age may be employed in the daytime only for light tasks that do not prejudice their health, studies and
participation in training. The Minister responsible for labor establishes the list of eligible tasks. With respect to
discrimination, the labor code eliminated the gender discrimination and in addition, the National Assembly adopted
a law in October 2001 outlawing discrimination against anybody, "whether based on ethnicity, colour of the skin,
physical features, origin, sex, opinions, religions"(Law No 47/2001).
3.

Effective Government

59.
The Rwandese identified poor govemance as one of the major causes of the violence, disunity and poverty
in the country. In that contex Rwanda would have to move away from the past of domineering, centralized and
exclusive state to one that is inclusive, effectively provides visionary leadership and other public goods, and creates
a conducive and market-fniendly environment in which economic and social activities can take place. The PRSP
underscored the need for effective public actions in the poverty reduction effort To this end, it stressed the need for
the government to (i) ensure good govemance, including transparency and accountability in public actions; (ii)work
in partnership with the civil society, the communities, the private sector and development partners; (iii) pnioritize
public actions through a consultative approach to policy making; and (iv) maintain national security and
macroeconomic stability. This new role requires a fundamental reorientation of the state, to function in a facilitative
rather than an imperial manner.
Reonentation of the Government
60.
Public Adrnisation: Since 1998, reformns have focused on rationalizing govemment institutions and
building capacity. Further reforns of government are essential to make every level of government to function in a
way that is consistent with the emerging paradigm of decentralized and facilitative govemment accountable to the
citizens. The implementation of administrative decentralization will be incremental, in line with the availability of
human and financial resources. The center has begun to transfer budget resources to the local councils while the
framework for fiscal decentralization is under development The new district administrations need to be kept lean
and, as decentralization proceeds, the central administration would need to be reformed in accordance to its new
mandate.
61.
Capacity building: Improving the effectiveness of public actions requires sustained efforts on the capacity
and operational efficiency in public administration, requiring progressive increases in civil service compensation,

16

Rwanda: County Assstce St

competitive recruitment and performance assessment and reward procedures, the enforcement of the regulations for
transparency and accountability and partnership with the private sector m implementing public sector programs.
Furthermore, reforns of laws and regulations need to replace broad powers of the govemment with market friendly
and facilitative provisions.
62.
To promote capacity building, a Human Resources Development Agency (HRDA) has been set up to
formulate, coordinate and monitor HRD policies and facilitate the implementation of agreed actions. A number of
new training institutions including the Rwanda Institute of Management (RIM) and the Kigali Institute of Science
Techmology and Management (KIST) have been set up to provide management training to public and private
sectors. While the development of technical skills is important capacity building should also foster the culture of
team work effectiveness, transparency and accountabiity.
Managing Public Finances
63.
Public expenditure, which has been just below 20 percent of GDP in recent years, rose to 21 percent in
2001 and about 22 percent in 2002, reflecting the needs to finance critical transition programs such as
demobilization, Gacaca, and decentralization. Starting in 1998, recurrent expenditures were progressively shifted to
the social sectors while increases in budgeted military expenditures slowed down. With demobilization, military
spending is expected to decline to about 2.3 percent of GDP by 2004. Further reductions will be needed to increase
spending on priority development programs whose needs remain substantial. The public expenditure tracking
survey of 2000 showed that the govenmment contnbution to primary schools and health centers was limited to the
salaries of teachers and health workers. Primary health centers depended on user fees while primary schools relied
on school fees and contributions from parents to meet operational costs, putting the facilities in poor areas at a
disadvantage. The rural focus of the PRSP implies more focus on spending for agricultural services, rural transport
infias
and public works.
64.
Furthermore, the PRSP proposes an expansion of public spending for economic infrastructure, agriculture
and rual public works, land titling and shelter for the homeless, and for the acceleration of programs for education
for all, HIV/AIDS, and health including malaria, the improvement of health services, and the expansion of health
insurance for the poor (mutuelles). In that context, the PRSP envisages expenditures of up to 30 percent of GDP.
(See Annex 6). These program will require substantial extenal support but careful husbanding of resources as
advocated by the PRSP, will be essential to meet the needs of the poor, the main target group for these expenditures.
65.
While recognizing the needs to increase expenditures in the transition from conflict to peace, the overall
expenditure/GDP ratio should be maintained at about 20 percent for the long-term. Higher levels of public spending
would require higher taxes or budget deficits, the latter implying increasing dependence on extemal financing In
both cases, private sector growth, the engine of the economy, will suffer from reduced resources for investment due
to higher taxes, competition from the govemment for skilled manpower, and poor incentives for export production
from large extemal inflows. Thus, the emphasis in the coming years should be on the effectiveness of public
spending. The recently introduced Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the budget, in the context of
well-defined sector strategies and clear policies, is the instrument to make the public expenditure management
(PEM) result-oriented and effective. The cooperation of extemal partners is essential for Rwanda to fully
operationalize the MTEF and make it work for the poor.
66.
Transparency and Accountability: The GoR began in 1998 to put into place the institutional framework
for financial accountability, with the establishment of the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), and the National
Tender Board (TB), and the initiation of the process of revising the laws, regulations and guidelines governing the
management of public finances. The GoR has revived the Office of the Inspector-General of Finance and Audit,
with the responsibility for coordinating the intemal audit the finances of govemment agencies, and the Public
Accounts Division of MlNECOFIN responsible for the preparation of annual public accounts (financial statements).
With the support from the World Bank and DFID, work has started on a financial accountability review and action
plan (FARAP), with a view to actions to improve financial accountability. The action plan will provide the
appropriate sequence of activities and proposals for institutional capacity building on a sustainable basis.

Rwanda: Country Assistance Sbate

17

67.
Domestic Resource Mobilizaion: To carry out the large agenda of actions outlined in the PRSP, the GoR
will require, inter alia, substantial financial resources from domestic and extemal sources. Domestic revenue
performance is low, at about 9.7 percent of GDP in 2000. The intrkduction of the VAT in January 2001 and its
effective implementation raised the revenue collection to 11 A percent of GDP in 2001. The PRSP has set a target of
12.8 percent of GDP in 2004. Revenue performance is expected to increase with the progressive improvement in the
capacity of the Rwanda Revenue Authority. There is a perception of excessive tax burden on the small formal
private sector. Surprises and uncertainty about the tax regime have adverse effects on private investment. Dialogue
on tax policies with the new Private Sector Federation and other private sector actors, is essential. With the
decentralization, new local taxes, for instance property taxes, have been introduced countrywide and local
governments have been vested with the authority to levy some other types of taxes. The impact of these taxes on the
poor will need to be closely monitored
C.

PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

68.
A large number of extemal aid agencies came to Rwanda following the genocide to support the
reconstruction effort and many have remained active in Rwanda. The principal agencies in Rwanda include the
European Union, the World Bank; the

flow of assistance improved somewhat in

2001 with some progress in the
implementation of the Lusaka Accord and the intensification of tansition-related reforns by Rwanda. The PRSP
process has enjoyed broad support and financial assistance from bilateral donors and has made a positive impact on
partnership as donors recognized the strong commitment of Rwanda to the process. In a GoR-Development Partners
conference in Kigali in November 2001, the donors commended the PRSP process, welcomed the daft PRSP and

18

Rwanda: Country Assistance Sbatgy

pledged to support its implementation. The donors also welcomed the new partnership fiamework developed as part
of the PRSP.
PRSP Partnerships Framework
69.
Partnership between the govemment the civil society and the donor community is as an essential buildingblock for poverty reduction. At the November 2001 meeting, the GoR presented the donors a draft framework for
GOR/donor partnership that reaffirmed the lead role of the GoR m donor coordination and the key role of the PRSP
process, the MTEF, and the development of sector strategies, as instruments for donor coordination. It noted that
budget support and sector-wide approaches (SWAPs) were the GoR's preferred modalities for external support and
recognized that the wide adoption of these modalities would need a process of dialogue and confidence building
between the GoR and the donor-community. It reaffirmed that meeting the standard of transparency and
accountability expected by the donors, an important element of building trust, was a pnonty for the GoR A number
of good partnership practices developed over the last few years will be maintained, including participatory
development of assistance strategies by the donors, and annual genemal donor meetings in Kigali, that are convened,
hosted and chaired by the GoR, with the full participation of the civil society.
70.
Sector Sbategies and Lead Agencies/Donors: The partnership famework document proposed the
nomiation of a lead sector agency (ministry) to manage the preparation of the sector strategy in each sector, with
support by a lead donor for the sector. The lead agency will be the principal contact in the govemrment with donors
and the civil society while the lead donor would assist the lead agency in coordinating the donor activities in the
sector, help to harmonize worklng procedures and practices, and support the sector strategy development process.
The GOR has recently proposed lead donors for clusters of key sectors as follows: agriculture, land, habitat and
environment (World Bank/EU); infastucture and ICT (EU/World Bank); human resource development and
capacity building (SIDA), pnvate sector development (USAID), social sector (DFID/Belgium), decentralization and
the Community Development Fund (Netherlands), and governance (UNDP). Discussions with the partners on the
proposal are underway.
IV.

THE BANK ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

71.
The 1998 CAS (Report No 17478-RW) proposed that Rwanda be treated as a special case for assistance from
the international community to enable Rwanda deal with the legacies of the 1994 genocide. Socio-econouic reforms
and external humanitarian and development assistance have contributed to improving the lives of the Rwandese and
given them hope for the future. Rwanda continues to need external assistance to implement the PRSP, including to
consolidate its efforts on national reconciliation, build a legitimate state and make peace with its neighbors The strong
presence of the Bank is essential for maintaining an effective international partnership in support of these efforts.
Consultations for the CAS
72.
The CAS benefited from the surveys and consultations of the PRSP. In the early stages of the preparation of
the CAS, the Bank and the PRSP Coordination Unit organized a two-day workshop in Kigali discussed the progress
and findings of the PRSP process, the emerging priority development issues, the progress in the implementation of the
Bank portfolio, and possible areas for Bank assistance. This workshop, attended by government officials and
representatives of the donor community, the private sector and civil society, followed a pattern established for
consultations on the country strategies of extemal partners, such as the consultations for the country strategy of the
European Union, and the UN systers UNDAF. Subsequently, the Bank held discussions with govemment officials in
several ministries, the PRSP tear, the donor community, the civil society, and key institutions involved in the change
process m Rwanda (the commissions for national reconciliation, legal and constitutional affairs, and human rights). The
CAS team has followed the PRSP process as it evolved, working closely with the PRSP team and participating in some
of the public discussions of the PRSP. Drafts of the CAS were shared with the Government and the donor partners.

Implementation of the Last CAS
73.
Suppoil to the Transion:The last CAS was presented to the Board on April 1998 and was followed with a
CAS Progress Report in June 1999, in periods of tension and conflict in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region, of
uncertainty about the socio-political direction in Rwanda, and fragile support by the donor-comnunity. The CAS and
the Progress report underlined the difficult socio-pohtical envirornment; recognized the transition from conflict to peace
as a complex, non-linear process in which set-backs often occur, and proposed that the Bank and other development
partners stay the course and support Rwanda's transition with exceptional assistance. Since then, Rwanda has initiated
and been implementing an ambitious program of economic and socio-political change and embraced the PRSP and its
participatory approach to development. The Bank supported the transition in prionty areas: economic recovery and
reform, national reintegration and human resource development and rehabilitation of social and economic
infrastructure.
74.
Assishtce Evaluaton: The dialogue with the Govemment, the civil society and development partners has
been frank and strong. The implementation of the portfolio has improved and all the pre-genocide projects have been
closed. These pre-genocide projects generally did not meet their initial development objectives and consequently, the
implementation completion reports (ICR) rated them as unsatisfactory, notwithstanding the contributions of the projects
in socio-economic recovery and the tremendous efforts by staff and government officials to implement them in a very
difficult conflict-affected environment The OED is cunently preparing a Country Assistance Evaluation of the program
in Rwanda, in collaboration with the AfDB.
75.
What has worked welk The Bank restuctured the pre-war projects, strengthened implementation and these
projects made valuable contnrbutions to the transition from emergency. Furthermore, the projects in the CAS and CAS
Progress Report were poverty focused and supported economic recovery and institutional capacity building, both key
elements of the transition. Furthermore all the projects proposed have been delivered. The Community Reintegration
and Development Project; a leaning and innovation project (LIL) has tumed into a best practice that provided a
foundation for the decentralization program of the Government The focus of the Country Office on project
implementation, in close collaboration with the authorities, has improved the performance of the portfolio.
76.
WM has not worked well: The Bank has not given adequate attention to long-term capacity building and
public sector reform areas where the GoR and the development partners looked for support from the Bank The GoR
and the development partners including the Bank often overestimated the capacity of implementing agencies. The result
has been inadequate assistance for capacity strengthening and delays in implementation. The proposed multi-sector
capacity building project will address the implementation of public sector reforms and capacity building needs.
Economic and sector work was also relatively neglected by the Bank and other partners. Some analytical work was
done but these were often infomnal and were not widely disseminated. This reflected the pressure, in a post-conflict
environment with substantial immediate needs and limited capacity, to step up lending and other services, including
Rwanda's access to the Enhanced HIPC and support to the preparation of the PRSP. Some of the analytical wealkesses
in the PRSP reflect the shortcomings of ESW (see Box 2).

Current Lending Portfolio
77.
The IDA portfolio consists of 8 projects. Three of the projects - the Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP), the
Competitiveness and Enterpnse Development Project (CEDP) and the Regional Trade Facilitation project were
approved in FY2001 and the Demobilization and Reintegration Project was approved in FY2002. The performance of
the portfolio has been satisfactory, thanks to the joint efforts with the Govemment on project implementation (see Box
12, Annex 4). However, perfonnance deteriorated somewhat in FY02 with one project cunrently rated unsatisfactory
on implementation progress and development objectives. Efforts are underway to improve the performance of this
unsatisfactory project. The Bank will also intensify training and capacity building on procurement and financial
management, two areas identified by successive CPPRs as needing improvements. As noted above, the Country Office,
despite capacity limitations, continues to be actively involved in project supervision. Its capacities for procurement and
financial management will be strengthened. The Govermment and the Country Office will continue to cany out
portfolio reviews on a quarterly basis to facilitate timely response to problems.

Rwanda: Country Assistance Strategy

Within the range of comnnitments in each case, the actual amount of lending will be determined by
80.
perfonnance and the availability of grant funding by donors, taking into account debt sustainability issues. The
Bank and the Government will regularly monitor the evolution of debt sustainability indicators and take necessary
actions to ensure debt sustainability. Should performance continue to be consistent with the base case but, due to
adverse shocks, Rwanda's debt sustainability indicators deteriorate with the net present value of debt to exports
ratio (NPVR) exceeding 200 percent, the Bank would approach the donors to explore the possibility for additional
grant financing for Rwanda that would compensate for lower amount of IDA credits. In the event that Rwanda's
performance were to justify a high case, and the IDA lending in such a scenario would result in the NPVRs
exceeding the debt sustainability value of 150%, the Bank would also approach the donors for enhanced grant
assistance. With the IDA13 Grants program allocation of the equivalent ofUS$49.8 million to Rwanda for FY03,
the WV/AIDS program and the Decentralization and Community Development Project will be financed by IDA
grants.
The Base Case Assistance Program

The base case assistance program, in the range of US$250-US$317 million, including about US$100 million
in IDA grants for FY03-05, would support the priorities of the PRSP. Progress toward peace, evidenced by the
81.

continued implementation of the Lusaka and Pretoria Peace Agreements (see paragraph 27), and continued progress in
institutional reforms for the political transition and good govemance (see paragraphs 28 and 29), would provide an
environment conducive to the successful implementation of the PRSP and enhance the overall performance of Rwanda.
In the context of good perfomnance in the implementation of the PRSP and shortfalls in donor grant-financing for the
PRSP, IDA lending could be in the high end of the range, to the extent that debt sustainability concems permit. Annex
B3 shows the program of activities in the planned base case lending program and Annex B4 the planned advisory
services to support the base case program. The specific triggers for the base case, covening some key priority actions in
the PRSP, are shown below in Table 4. A detailed description of the base-case lending program is presented below.

Rwanda: County Asssace Sbttegy
82.
Revializaon of the rural economy: The Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP), a 14-year Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) approved by the Board in April 2001, is the main instrument of support to agriculture and the rural sector.
It supports the Governnent's strategy of promoting the transition from subsistence to a market-oriented agriculture by
providing the technology, mfinastucte, credit and other support services, and the institutional capacity to foster this
transition, improve productivity, and expand and diversify exports. A GEF funded component of RSSP is focusing on
the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources through the integrated management of critical ecosystems,
with emphasis on wetlands/watershed and dry land ecosystem management and reducing the pressure on protected
areas through community management of the buffer zones. The second and intermediary phase of the APL is planned
for 2005-2011. The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project is supporting the revival of the Union du
Banques Populaire (UBP) and the small and rural credit system
83.
Other ongoing projects - the human resources development project (HRDP), the rural water and sanitation
project (RWSP) are contributing to better rural living conditions and strengthening the rural economy. The proposed
Decentralization and Conmunity Development Project is expected to support rural communities in social and
economic development Reforns of the coffee and tea sectors supported by Bank adjustment credits stimulate rural
incomes. The Bank will collaborate closely with the European Union, USA1D, Belgium, and AfDB, the other partners
that are active in agriculture and rural development The Bank is cunrently supporting a sector expenditure review in
agriculture with the objective to increase the effectiveness of public actions and provide the basis for donor partnership
in the sector.
84.
Private sector dewelopment and employment creadon: The areas of Bank support are policy and institutional
reforms and improvements of infrastucture. The proposed Institutional Reform Credit (IRC) will complement the IDAsupported Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Credit (CEDP), and the Rural Sector Support Credit (RSSP) in
supporting policy and institutional reforms. The CEDP is providing tecliucal assistance for the privatization of key
fifastructa facilities, the strengthening of the commercial legal system and the financial sector, the promotion of
investments and exports, and the development of small-scale enterprises. The Regional Trade Facilitation Project
provides insurance against political risks to facilitate commercial financing for productive transactions between
enterprises in participating countries and their foreign partners. The proposed Institutional Reform Credit (IRC) will
support broader privatization of state enterprises and the reform of the financial sector.
85.
New interventions are proposed for (i) energy, environment and water resources and to support institutional
reform and new investments; (ii) urban infrastructure to strengthen urban institutions, improve urban services and
provide employment, and a (ui) road transport with emphasis on rehabilitation and maintenance of main roads. A
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) would support interventions in energy, environment and water resources
while a traditional investment project is under will support the urban and road transport interventions (See Anmex B3).
The Bank will work closely with the EU and the AMDB, the two key partners in infrastructure.
86.
Human and social development The vehicles of ongoing support in this area include the HRDP, focusing on
improving access and quality of education, the RWSP, supporting rWal water and sanitation, the Community
Development and Reintegration Project (CRDP) that supports community based mini-prqjects, and the demobilization,
and reintegration project Proposed new interventions are on HVI/AIDS, capacity building, urban mfatructure, health,
education, and community development Support for health and education would be provided by PRSCs. The Bank is
working closely in education with DFID, the most active development partner in the sector. With the assistance of
DFID, the GoR is working to develop the framework for the sector-wide approach (SWAP) in the education sector. In
addition, the Bank and the GoR are preparing an education-sector status report, and a sector expenditure review is
planned for FY05. These will help the processes of sector strategy and expenditure framework formulation that will
underpin the PRSC and the SWAP.
87.
On HI V/AIDs, a project under the Africa MAP program will support the GoR's comprehensive multi-sector
H[V/AIDs prevention strategy. As in recent Bank operations, new sector projects will include EHV/AIDS components
to deal with the specific dimensions of the epidemic in the sector. A sector status report is under preparation for the
health sector and a health financing study is planned for FY04, with a health intervention through a PRSC in FY04.
The Bank has provided technical assistance to the Government to prepare its actions on gender, promoted the
participation of women in projects, and addressed gender disparity issues in policy and institutional reforms under

Rwanda: Country Assistnce Sategy

23

adjustment credits. The latter in particular has helped to mainstream gender issues and will remain important in the
Bank's support on gender. A recently approved IDF grant will support capacity building for implementing the Gender
Legal Action Plan. The Bank assisted the GoR to prepare a demobilization and reintegrationprogram, in the context of
the regional DDR program.
88.
Under the ongoing Community Reintegration and Development Project (CRDP), commurity development
committees (CDCs) have conceived, designed and implemented projects for the benefit their conmmunities. This has
enhanced community integration, and provided a model of empowerment of rural conmunities and decentralized
implementation that has been adopted for the implementation of the HRDP, the RWSP, and rural sector development
(RSSP). The proposed Decentralization and Community Development Project will build on the achievements of the
CRDP, extend the capacity building support and project finance to additional rural districts.
89.
Improving the effectiveness of public sector actions and governance: The proposed Institutional Reform
Credit (IRC), being presented to the Board together with this CAS, is a precursor to a possible Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) that will continue the support for reform efforts provided by the Econonic Recovery
Credit (Cr. 3182-RW). The IRC will support reforms in (i) public expenditure management including the
implementation of the MTEF and public financial management; (ii) private sector development including privatization
and the reform of the financial sector, and (ii) gender and budget related institutional issues in the area of human
development The IRC will complement the ongoing Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Credit and the
proposed multi-sector capacity building project (MSCP) under preparation, in support of broad public sector
institutional reform and capacity building. The MSCP will assist in bringing together the interventions of various
partners into a coherent program to enhance the public sector capacity. The program of economic and sector work (see
Advisory Services below) will support the policy and institutional reforms. These analytical activities will help to lay
the basis for the PRSCs, planned for FY04 and FY05 (see Box 13, Annex 5 for preparations for the PRSC).
High CaseLending
90.
The implementation of the Lusaka and Pretoria Agreements is critical for peace process in the region but
internal socio-economic refotms and regional cooperation are essential to maximize the peace dividend and sustain
peace. As the peace process proceeds, the Bank and the international community would need to assist the governments
in the region address the legacies of the regional conflict; consolidate social and economic recovery, and promote
regional cooperation/integration. Regional peace, cooperation and trade will enhance secunty, economic growth and
poverty reduction in Rwanda. Thus, the CAS proposes a high case to support programs for social rehabilitation and
reintegration, regional infiastructure and institutions that are critical to the development of Rwanda and its neighbors, in
the context of rapid progress by Rwanda in implementing its PRSP. The Regional Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration (DDR) program is already in place, and in that context, IDA is providing support for demobilization and
reintegration in Rwanda. As in this program, IDA resources would be used to leverage grants from the donor
community for other interventions with a regional focus.
91.
The planned high-case lending includes the base case lending program and two projects to promote regional
trade and integration (see Table 3). The proposed regional infrastructure and environment project would support the
rehabilitation/construction of tansportation, energy, communications and environental infiastucture while the
regional institutions and services project will aim to develop the framework and capacity for regional institutions,
facilitate the flow of services and pave the way for regional integration. The high case would be conditioned on:
i.

satisfactory progress in meeting the triggers of the base case, with rapid progress in implementing the PRSP,
particularly the good governance aspects (see Table 4);

ii. all IDA supported projects with satisfactory ratings on both implementation progress (IP) and development
objectives (DO)
iii. adoption of a legal and regulatory framework that facilitates the liberal flow of labor, goods and services within
the region. Amendments to the labor code, the investment code and the tariff structure may be necessary.

24

Rwnda: Counby Assistnce S bt
iv. an environment conducive to sustainable regional cooperation evidenced by the revival of the Economic
Community of the Countries of the Great Lakes (CEPGL) or similar regional institution that facilitates regional
cooperation.

Low Case Lending
92.
The PRSP recognized a stable macroeconomic enviromnent, good govemance, human development,
partnerships, and prioritization of public actions as overarching requirements for poverty reduction. Furthermore, the
PRSP identified the MTEF as the key instrent for implementing the PRSP. Failure to make progress m these areas
would undermine the poverty reduction effort and would trigger a low case program by IDA. The specific triggers for
the low would be:
i.

failure to maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework;

ii. unsatisfactory progress in implementing the financial accountability action plan,
iii. failure to increase and protect budget allocations to PRSP priority areas; and
iv. lack ofprogress in implementing the MTEF.
93.
The performance in these areas will be assessed in accordance with the base-case performance benchmarks
(see Table 4 above). Lending in the low case would be US$80 million over three years. The program would consist of
projects with a direct inpact on the poor and would include the proposed Decentralization and Community
Development, the HIV/AIDS and the new Rural Sector Support projects. In addition, the low case would include a
Primary Health Services prqject, in lieu of the health intervention in the PRSC, to maintain the delivery of heath
services to the poor. The Bank would also continue to implement the ongoing projects with poverty and rural focus
including the ongoing RSSP, the rural water supply, and the relevant components of the human resource development
project However, new lending and the implementation of the portfolio would depend on the extent that security
conditions permit.
Use of IDA Grants
94.
Rwanda as a debt vulnerable IDA-only low-income country is eligible to have part of its IDA allocation as
grants under the IDA 13 Grants program The IDA Grants allocation to Rwanda for FY03 amounts to SDR37.8 million
(US$49.8 million). The grants would be used to fund the HIV/AIDs project (US$30 million), the Decentralization and
Community Development Project (US$15 million), and the Multi-Sector Capacity Building Project (US$4.8 million)
[see Table 3]. The grant allocations for FY04 and FY05 will fund programs in health, water supply and education in
the PRSC planned for both years, and for urban water and sanitation component of the proposed Road Rehabilitation
and Maintenance and Urban nfastcture and Employment Project planned for FY04. Any additional funds will
support rural Dnfiastuct.
The IDA grants program is an important element in addressing the debt sustainability
problemns of Rwanda (see below).
Enhanced E]PC and Debt Sustainability
95.
In late December 2000, the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank approved the Decision Point for
Rwanda under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (eHIPC) Initiative. Under the Initiative, Rwanda
will receive debt relief amounting to US$452.4 million in NPV terms or an estimated US$810 million in nominal
terms, with IDA assistance of US$404.8 over 20 years. Rwanda is receiving interim assistance from IDA, the
IMF, the AfDB, the European Union and the Paris Club. The eHIPC Completion Point, originally planned for
end-2002, is now expected for mid-2003, due to the delay in finalizing the PRSP. However, the deterioration in
2001 of external economic conditions and the sharp decline of the prices of the export commodities of Rwanda
have resulted in the deterioration of its debt sustainability indicators. Annex 6 presents a brief note on the debt
sustainability challenges facing Rwanda and the options for addressing them. It recognizes that the recovery of
exports, for which there remains considerable scope, is the key for achieving long-run debt sustainability. It
discusses recent performance of exports, noting that Rwanda's exports to GDP ratio at around 8 percent is among

Rwanda: Counby Assistnce Stytey
25
the lowest in the world, and lower than the ratio in the 1980s. It concludes that the policy and institutions actions
underway or planned by the GoR, with the support of its partners including IDA, have improved the prospects of
strong export recovery in the medium-term.
96.
The note discusses other actions to mitigate Rwanda's debt sustainability risks while facilitating its access
to resources for growth and poverty reduction. The prospect of IDA13 grants for Rwanda helps in this direction.
Rwanda, with US$220 per capita income in 2001 is eligible for the grants under the debt vulnerability and
H1V/AIDS criteria. As noted above, it has been allocated SDR37.8 million for FY03 but the proportion of grants
it may qualify for in subsequent years has still to be decided. The substitution of the IDA grant allocation in FY0305 for equivalent amounts of credits reduces the NPVRs to the range of 155-180 in 2003-2019. However,
Rwanda's transition from conflict to peace and development and the implementation of the ambitious agenda in
the PRSP requires substantial financial support from its development partners. Additional possible actions are
required to rmitigate the risks to debt sustainabiity and provide the cushion for Rwanda' access to the resources it
needs to develop its economy and reduce poverty. Possible actions by the intemational community include higher
and predictable flow of grants from donors, possible consideration of additional debt relief at the Completion
Point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the extension of the scope ofthe IDA grants. The analyses showed that
the IDA13 grants program for FY03-05 has a substantial impact in reducing the NPVRs from the range of 203175 to a range 180-155. Increase in donor grants would have a similar positive impact Furthermore, possible
topping up of the Enhanced HIPC debt relief at the Completion Point combined with the IDA grants in FY03-05
would enable Rwanda to secure a viable long-term debt outlook.

transport) and a financial accountability review and action plan (FARAP). The latter will support the upgrading of
Rwanda's systerns of financial accountability. The Bank plans to upgrade the work on FARAP to a CFAA. These ESW
activities will provide the basis for the PRSC planned for FY04 and FY05. (See Box 13, Annex 5).

With respect to the poverty assessment, the recent Household Living Standards Survey (HLSS) has provided
the information on poverty in Rwanda and the GoR has prepared an analyses and a report of the key characteristics of
poverty. 8 A country econonic memorandum (CEM) under prepartion, will assess the growth prospects of Rwanda,
with an emphasis on rural sector and exports growth This, together with the work on the agricultural sector strategy and
agricultural intensification, will contribute to the fornulation of a rural strategy. The HLSS provides the data for the

CEM to link poverty with specific constraints to growdt The financial sector in Rwanda is under stress, from the
burden of non-performing loans as well as the poor legal framework. In the context of the Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development Project the Bank will assist the Govemment with the tecniucal analysis of financial sector
issues. As the peace process in the Great Lakes region evolves, the Rwanda country team will collaborate with other
country teams/networks in the Bank and other development partners on analytical work on reconstruction and regional
development and integration issues. The Bank will continue to take advantage of grant funding from the Development
Grant Facility (DGF) and donor trust funds to support capacity building and governance in both the govemment and the
civil society.

instruments to be used in monitoring, and responsibilities assigned to various agencies within the Govemrment The core
monitoring instruments include the Household Living Standards Survey (BISS), the Core Welfare Indicators
Questionnaire (CWIQ), the Public Expenditure Tracking surveys (PETS), the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
and the Citizen Report Card. The HLSS, the CWIQ, the PETS and the DHS were recently undertaken and provided the
data for the preparation of the PRSP. The Bank; DFID, the UNDP and the AfDB supported the implermentation of the
HLSS, the CWIQ and the PETS and will continue to support the use of these instruments of monitoring performance
and outcomes. The Bank is also providing support for capacity building to a restructured Statistics Department Table 6
presents the core indicators to be monitored for assessing the progress in the implementation of the program supported
by the CAS. The indicators include some ongoing and planned PRSP actions (the adoption of the land law,
implementation of the MT ) and outcomes from policy and other public actions (infant mortality, HIV/AIDS

infection rate). In addition to these core indicators, The Bank intends to intensify efforts in monitoring progress and
outcomes in IDA supported projects and support the development of monitoring capacity with our advisory services
(public and sector expenditure reviews, for instance).
B.

IFC AND MIGA

100.
International Finance Corporaton: IFC has one investment in a Rwanda match factory (Sorwal). In FY98,
IFC approved an investment in Highland Flowers and in FY00 in Rwandacell, the cellular telephone provider. However
neither proceeded to utilize IFC resources. IFC also approved a US$800,000 investment in an apartment hotel in Kigali
in December 2000. IFC is ready to support viable investments in Rwanda and IFC staffs have visited Rwanda to look at
opportunities in privatization, SMEs, financial and industrial sectors.
101.
Mulatemel Investnent Guarantee Agency: Rwanda ratified the MIGA convention in October 27, 1987 and
Rwanda signed and ratified the MIGA Convention on October 27, 1989. It has paid the usable cunrency portion of its
initial subscription, but has yet to make its local currency contnrbution or fialize its promissory note portion.
Consequently, MIGA cannot issue guarantees for Rwanda. However, MIGA staff assisted Rwanda in the setting up of
its in investment promotion structures.
C.

COLLABORATION WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

102.
In the context of the PRSP Partnership Framework (see paragraph 69), the Bank will collaborate with other
donors to support the implementation of the PRSP and improve the effectiveness of development assistance. The Bank
will support the harmonization of donor procedures and the strengthening of the budget process and financial
accountability and transparency to encourage donors to provide more flexible financial support and facilitate the
adoption of SWAPs.
103.
Collaboration with the International Monetary Fund: During the last three years, the Bank and the IMF
staffs have collaborated closely in the design and monitoring of economic and institutional reform and tecluical
assistance programs, monitoring budget perfornance, and in the preparation the eHIPC Decision point and the PRSP.
Often these activities involved the EU, the AfDB and DFID. Collaboration will continue on supporting the economic
reform program, the implementation of the PRSP and meeting the eHIPC completion point conditions, with a view to
Rwanda reaching the completion point before mid-2003.
104.
Collaboration with the Uned Natons/UlVDP: The Bank participated actively in the preparation of the UN
system's integrated country framework (United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)) for assistance
to Rwanda. The Bank has also worked with the GoR and UNDP, the lead agency for assisting the GoR in aid
coordination and resource mobilization, in the development of the framework for donor coordination and partnerships.
V.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND PROSPECFS FOR POVERTY REDUCHON

Sources of growth
105.
Rwanda does not have significant natural resource endowments. Its most important assets include its ferfile
soils, despite the degradation of the land in recent decades, favorable climate and its disciplined labor force and
relatively strong institutions. Its natural resources include a favorable climate, its beautiful topography with hills, lakes
and forests with rare animals, the large natural gas reserves in Lake Kivu, and some mineral deposits including coltan.
The potential sources of growth for Rwanda are outlined in Box 4.9 The PRSP recognizes that the transformation of the
economy will require macroeconomic and socio-political stability, regional peace and cooperation, and strong private
sector and the adoption of new technologies. While Rwanda has made substantial progress in recent years in reviving its
economy, real sustained development depends overwhelmingly on peace, security and cooperation in the region. In this
9

Analytical work on investigatg the sources of grwth has started, including under the Bank's Country Economic Memorandum.

context, Rwanda would be able to attract pnvate investments and obtain the long-term commitments of donor support
that it needs to develop its resources.

Prospects for growth
106.
Three scenarios (base, high and low case) are considered for economic growth and poverty reduction, with the
key determining factor being the outcome of the cun-ent discussions for peace in the region:
Base Case: This assumes that (i) the Pretoria Agreement is implemented and regional peace prospects and
107.
commercial relations progressively improve; (ii) at the national level, social and political stability is progressively
strengthened with the implementation of the socio-political transition program (see paragraphs 28 and 29); (ii) the
implementation of the PRSP, particularly the agricultural strategy, with increasing use of productivity enhancing inputs,
the restoration of environental inaucture and the security of land tenure, and the continued implementation of the
program of policy and institutional refonns (see Box 10). Rapid growth in the agricultural sector of about 5 percent per
anmum will raise nral incomes, stimulate rnual trade and commerce, create non-farm runal employment and reduce rnual
poverty. In addition, the linkages of the agricultural sector with other non-rual econormic sectors (trade and services,
constructon, manufacturing), will stinulate overall economic activity and raise GDP growth In this contex real GDP
growth is expected to average about 6 percent per armum in the mediwm-ten. The incidence of poverty will
progressively fall, particularly with rapid agricultural growth.
108.
High Case: The same assunptions as the base case apply and in addition there are: (i) intenal peace and
stability in the other countnes in the region; (ii) a climate conducive to regional cooperation; (iii) strong international
support for peace, conflict-related reintegration, development and regional integration, and (iv) the accelerated
implementation of the program of policy and institutional reforms. Durable peace in Rwanda and the region would
attract private investments to rehabilitate the mining sector, develop the natural gas reserves in Lake Kivu, and stimulate
tourism, with the tourists taking advantage of the opportunities in the in the Eastern DRC/northwest Rwanda/westem
Uganda axis. Enhanced official development assistance for regional infrastructure and institutions will help ease
Rwanda's transportation constraints and facilitate its exports. Rwanda's exports would also benefit from strong

Rwanda: Country Assistane Stegy

29

economic growth in the DRC. In this high case scenario, growth of GDP would be in the range of 6-8 percent per
annum, poverty would fall rapidly and Rwanda would be able to meet the targets of Vision 2020 and the MIDGs.Â°0
109.
Low Case: This assumes (i) a failure to capitalize on the peace agreement, thus a continuation of low level and
sporadic conflict in DRC, with Rwandan troops in the DRC; and/or (ii) social and political stability is in question
because the key socio-political transition processes (see paragraphs 28 and 29) have not yielded the expected outcomes.
In this scenano, the lack of progress in national reconciliation and governance, and the risks of intemal strife and the
escalation of conflict in the region will have adverse effects external assistance, pnvate investment in Rwanda, and trade
and commerce in the region. Under these circumstances, economic growth will be about 2-4 percent per annum and
poverty would progressively increase.

high levels of sickness, and difficulties in accessing health facilities due to high costs. Rwanda should comfortably
achieve the MDGs in education under the base and high cases above, but the health related MDGs require exceptional
efforts due to the very low health standards, severe capacity constraints in the health sector, and resource constraints at
the public and household levels. These targets require simultaneous progress on the control of malaria and HIV/AIDS,
and better quality of and access to healthcare, health education, nutrition, immunizations, and reproductive health
services.

Riskfadors Rwanda is involved in a complex set of transitions, including the change fiom the cunrent Anisha
Accord coalition of political parties to an elected Parliament and President, from a centralized administration to a
decentalized one, and from a largely command economy to a market-based one. The comnmitment of the Government
to economic reforms and decentralization appears very strong but its the technical and implementation capacity is weak.
The conflict in the Great Lakes region, an obstacle to sustained recovery in Rwanda, is still largely unresolved. The
Government has faced armed opposition from Rwandan exiles based in the DRC, particularly members of the
interahamwe, renamed the Ann6e de Liberation du Rwanda, (A1iR). There has also been opposition from exiled
prominent politicians, including those who previously had served in the current transition government The relations
between Rwanda and Uganda deteriorated in 2000 and remained strained. Financing of the transition program by the
development partners has been fragile due in part to the volatile environment in the region, the involvement Rwandan
troops in the war in the DRC and the slow progress toward peace since the initial signature of the Lusaka Accord.
112.
Risk assessment The reforms that Rwanda is undertaking are ambitious and necessary but the context is
difficult. The ftagile social fabric and legitimacy of the Govenmment and its weak technical capacity, could impede these

reforms. The very challenging logistics of Gacaca will need to be managed well, however the success of Gacaca will
depend on the continuing willingness of the population and the suspects to speak out fieely at the tribunals, the
administration of the sentences including the comnunity service component, and the availability of resources for the
compensation payments. Gacaca is an experiment that everyone hopes will work out well because there are few other
altenatives.
113.
Elections for national offices are planned for 2003. Respecting the time-table and managing the process in a
transparent and inclusive manner will help ensure the legitimacy of the new govemment The population is very
supportive of decentralization but, with Rwanda's long tradition of centralized administration, institutional inertia could
undermine the shift of power to the districts and alienate the population. The path to peace in the Great Lakes region
remains difficult Progress in the formation of an all-inclusive govemment in the DRC and the cessation of hostilities in
Burundi has been slow. The disarmament of irregular forces including the interahamwe of Rwanda remains a
challenge. The relations between Rwanda and Uganda have remained strained despite efforts to resolve the differences.
114.
Risk M&igaion Factors.The success of the socio-economic reform program in Rwanda in generating growth,
raising incomes and protecting personal liberties will encourage the rejection of violence as a way to resolve problems.
The support and leverage of the intemational community has been important for prornoting refomis and ensuring
appropriate implementation. Coordinated intemational actions for conflict resolution in the region gathered momentum
within the last year. The recent bilateral agreements between Rwanda and DRC in Pretoria, and Uganda and the DRC
in Luanda, have given a welcome boost to the Lusaka Process and facilitated bilateral contacts between the countries in
conflict Rwanda has moved quickly to withdraw its troops from the DRC, in accordance with the Pretoria Agreement
There has been some progress in the disarmament and repatiation of Rwandese fighters from the DRC to Rwanda.
Rwanda and Uganda are continuing to dialogue at all levels, including at a recent meeting in London by the presidents
of the two countries is helping Rwanda and Uganda, to pemmanently resolve their differences. The growing support of
the intemational community for peace, reintegration and economic and political reforms reduces the risks of social
unrest and violent conflict in the regiorL In this regard, the support of the donors for theregional DDR program is
important for peace and stability in the region.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

115.
Building social capital, reducing poverty, developing human resources, decentralization and a transition to
peace and democracy, key aspects of the development agenda in Rwanda, require sustained efforts and support
National dialogue in the context the PRSP has sharpened the development agenda, increased its ownerslhip by
Rwandese and the acceptance ofthe agenda by the intemational community. Rwanda needs the sustained support of the
intemational community to implement this agenda.

Box 7: Grassroots Participation through Deoent,"Ilzat.on

The Rwandese'system of govemment has historically been centralized and'undemocraftc'and'ha's been characterized by,
ri(i) the exclusion' of the majon'ty, of the population in the making of decisions that' concer their livelihood; (ii)'the accumulation.
of. political 'and economic power at the center; (iii) the concentration of power iii ppe person,at local levels,, for instance the
Bourgmestre"at the commune: level; (iv), the lack of transparency and accountability' a't ilocal 'administrativ'esstructu,res,' (v)
passivity, lack of initiative':and.a dependency syndrome on the part of the majority of the population ,ue to'tith,ex,cessiv.e
centralization of,power and exclusion from participation; and (vi) little participationi'of women and youth inAthe.rudnigi.,of!,th"'
politcal, economic and administrative affairs,'

-Pfesidential consultations held between May 1998 and. March 1999, (Urugwiro Village. meetings) resolved that
decentralization and democratization would be necessary to reconcile the Rwan'dese people and fight-poverty. The ministry for.
local govemrment was-thus mandated to formulate the necessary policies. InMay,2000, t.issued .the National Decentralization
Poiicy, as,anihstrument f6r the political empowerment,,reconciliation, social integration'and well bei,ng of the population,' ahd a,
.platform for, sustainable democratization and the, mobilization of economic'development energies. The objectiVes,'of the'
decentralization, are to: ' ' ', ',
Promote the participation of local people in initiating, making, implementing and monitoring decisions and plans that
concem them by transfering power, authority and resources from central to local govemment levels.
Strengthen accountability and transparency by making local leaders directly accountable to the communities they
,-,> serve, with clear linkages between the taxes people pay and the services financed by these taxes.
I,
Enhance the ,'sensitivity and responsiveness *of public administration to the local environment, motivate the
;developmerit of sustainable economic planning and management capacity' as an engine for poverty reduction.
-The-decentralization framewvork provides for four levels of local administration, namely the Intara, Akerere, Umurenge and
`Akagati.corresponding roughly to the' prefeciures, commun'es, sector and'cellule levels. The Intara is a deconcentrated entity
'

with the'responsibilityto, coordinate the planning, execution and supervision of central government programs within its
jurisdiction, and'rmonitoir and evaluate the activities of the Akerere on behalf of the central Govemment. The Akerere, the
,,decentralized govemrnent entity with alegal personality and specified functions, services and resources devolved to it,isto be
the'center of economic! and social development: Both the Umurenge and Akagar1'are administrative entities; the latter isthe'
levlI closestdto the people and'is where community needs are identified. The Akerere has a coordinating role over the
',Umurenge.and similarly,-the latter has arole to coordinate the activities of the Akagari. As the capacities of the Akerere and
bUurenge,councils'improve: (i)the Akerere will get some of the responsibilities of the Intara; and (ii)the Akerere will transfer'
so6me administrative functions to the Umurenge. Ultimately the Intaralevel will be phased out. There are some slight variations
;
'
of the general framework f6 urban'areas.
The Akagari Council, -cosisting of -all members of the community aged 18 years and above, elects the executive.
committee of 10 persons including the chairperson,'with the responsibility to identify the needs of the community, mobilize
resources and design, and implement development plans. Council members at the Umurenge and, Akerere levels are similarly
'elected, with mandatory representation of women'and youthme'mbers. An electoral college, consisting of the elected council
members of the Akerere Council, the members of the executive committee of the Umurenge Councils, and the chairpersons of
the Akagan' Councils,,elects the,executive committee of the Akerere. Asimilar electoral college elects the execubve committee'
'of the U,mwrenge. The lntara Coordination Committee consists of the chairpersons of the Akerere' Councils inthe Intara, and
chairpersomn executive,secretary, heads of departments and services of the /ntara, all appointed by the central govemment.
The National Assembly passed the Decentralization Law inNovember 2000 and elections were held on March 6,2001 .for
,the Akerere Councils. The initiai emphasis of implementation will be put on capacity building at all levels. The decentralization'
isaradical departure from years of centralized administration. The GoR has established the National Transformation Steering
.Committee,and the DecentralizaUion Management Unit to provide the oversight and technical capacity for the implementation.

The 2002 budget expenditure was revised and substantally reduced inthe mid-term budget review and total expenditure will be
about 22.1 percent of GDP from 25.1 percent.
In2000, the budget allocation for the gendamere (military police) was taken out of the defense budget, with the establishment of
the civilian police force. This budget was normally about 0.5 percent of GDP.
Social expenditures include the Genocide Victims Funs inthe 'other category'

-38Annex 5: Preparation for PRSCs
Box 13: Path to Poverty Reduction Support Credits
The completion of the full PRSP clears the way for PRSCs, with the first PRSC planned for FY04. A number of ongoing and planned ESW on budget
management and financial accountability and capacity building instatistics, monitoring and evaluation are underway or planned to support the move
to PRSds. Donor coordination isalso important as the move to PRSCs coincides with the adoption of sector wide approaches (SWAPs), starling with
te' education sector.
.ESW to support the implementation of the PRSP
The key budget-related analytical activities'for the implementation of the PRSP relate to the'development of sectors strategies, the MTEF, the
framework for SWAPs, and public administration reform. A number of analytical activities are already underway or planned including:
* country status reports on education and health that will provide snapshots of the status of the sectors and thus the sound basis for
revising the sector strategies;
* a rural energy study isnearing completion and awater resources management strategy isunder development.
* a public expenditure management review (PEMR) and sector expenditure reviews (SERs) inagriculture and transport are underway.
The PEMR isfocusing on the implementation of the MTEF while the SERs are designed to assist line ministries to intemalize the
MTEF. SERs help inthe design, inline with sector strategies, of integrated budget programs and to identify indicators for monitoring
theperformance of the programs. These expenditure reviews will be completed by end-2002;
* SER for the education sector and heaflth financing and SER are planned.
'
The framework for the use of aSWAP'for education isunder development.
*
DFID and UNDP are assisting the GoR inthe review of public administration.
Improving the Fiduclary Environment
Afinancial accountability review and action plan (FARAP) isunderway. The diagnostic/review phase of FARAP has been completed. It highlighted
the gaps, strengths and weaknesses of the system of accountability and provides abasis for dialogue and action planning. Inthis second phase, the
Govemrnent, inconsultation with interested donors, wil prepare an action plan that will bring together and rationalize ongoing activities and integrate
new priorities. Key areas for action' include intemal auditing, financial reporting, procurement, financial accountability systems and capacity in'local
govemments, and'monitoring and dissemination of budget information. The action-planning phase should be completed in late 2002. The FARAP
also provides the basis for carrying out aCFAA.
J!The.FARAP found! that he National Tender Board, established in,1998, has' made substantial progress. A Country Procurement Assessment and
Report (CPAR) isplanned to assess the performance indetail and propose action for strengthening the system.
'Monitoring and Evaluation
A number of actions have been taken and underway to strengthen the institutional framework for monitoring the budget, poverty and social indicators.
'The PovedyObservatoire (OPR), established in 1999 to monitor the impact of public actions on poverty and social indicators isoperabtonal. The
Central Projects and Extemal Finance Bureau (CEPEX) was established for monitoring and evaluation of public investment programs. The budget,
has been computerized which will facilitate the producbon of the regular flash reports on govemment expenditure commitments and payments. The
statistics and management informadon systems inthe ministries of health, education and agriculture are being strengthened. Areform of the nabonal
statistics'system isunderway.
The PRSP set out a comprehensive system for monitoring poverty including the use of a number of instruments, namely: the household living
jstandards survey (HLSS), the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS), national poverty
assessments (NPA), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). These instruments, which have recently been used to collect information in
200X2001 for the preparation of the PRSP, will be complemented by routine informabon from the line ministres, OPR, CEPEX and national statstics.
.Inraddition, the PRSP envisages the use of Citizen Report Cards to assess the citzens perception of public sector policies'and performance, and
specifically the delivery of public services.
,Donor Coordination
We plan to work with other donors, either through cofinancing of a PRSC or inthe context of a SWAP. The GoR's new donor partnership framework
will facilitate the coordinabon of donors. Nevertheless, the donors will have to be sensitized of the PRSC and SWAP and be involved in the
preparatory activites such as the ESW and'the fiduciary exercises. We have been working with some bilateral donors inthese areas but we-intend to
bring inm,ore donors into the process.

-39Annex 6
Annex 6: Rwanda: IDA Lending and Debt Sustainability

Introduction
Under the Enhanced HIPC (eHIPC) Decision Point (DPT) in December 2000, Rwanda is to
1.
receive debt relief amounting to a total of US$ 810 million in nominal terms over time including US$
404.8 million over 20 years from IDA. It is currently receiving interim assistance from IDA, IMF,
AfDB, the European Union and the Paris Club. The eHIPC Completion Point is expected in mid2003. Rwanda's NPV of debt-to-export ratio has deteriorated significantly since the Decision Point
mainly due to lower export receipts resulting from a sharp decline for commodity prices for its main
exports - coffee, tea and coltan. With an estimated $220 per capita GNP in 2001, Rwanda needs
external support to fund its transition from conflict to peace, security and development, sustain its
poverty reduction efforts as articulated in its PRSP recently discussed by the Board, and make
progress toward the MDGs.
2.
This annex to the CAS examines the evolution of debt sustainability indicators since the
eHIPC Decision Point and the prospects for external assistance and exports, which are the key factors
in debt sustainability calculations. It discusses the actions of the Government and international
development partners need to take to enhance debt sustainability while maintaining the momentum of
growth and poverty reduction in Rwanda and explores the impact of the actions on the debt
sustainability indicators.
Evolution of Debt Sustainability Projections
3.
The NPV of debt-to-export ratio (NPVR) of the baseline Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
at the Decision Point was 192.5 percent in 2000, peaking at 197 percent in 2002 before gradually
declining below 150 percent in 2008. The "hump" in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio was due to the
combination of low levels of exports in 1998-99 (lowering the three-year average of exports) and a
rise in NPV of debt in 2000 from disbursements on borrowing that had already taken place by the
December 2000 HIPC Decision Point.

4.
The terms of trade of Rwanda, after improving by 7.6 percent in 2000, deteriorated by 21
percent in 2001 and expected to deteriorate further by 4.5 percent in 2002, mainly due to the fall of
coffee and tea prices. With depressed commodity prices and projections of lower export volume
growth and slow recovery of prices in response to world market developments, the debt sustainability
outlook has deteriorated. Thus, in the updated macroeconomic projections and DSA of 2002
(Updated Scenario), the NPVR ratio falls below 150 in 2014 compared to 2008 in the Decision Point
DSA (see Figure 1), notwithstanding the assumptions of higher grants financing than the DPT
scenario. In the Updated Scenario, disbursements from all external borrowing average about US$40
million, compared to the average of US$75 million per annum in recent years, including US$50-60
million from the IDA. This scenario would imply a significant contraction of IDA disbursements to
about US$30 million per year. The assumptions of the Updated Scenario on external financing needs
and the grant financing of these needs have been largely driven by the need to achieve the NPVR
ratio of 150 in the medium-term, bringing the NPVRs to closer to those projected in the Decision
Point DSA.
Financing the PRSP
5.
The PRSP prepared two detailed medium-term (2002-2004) public expenditure plans with
costing of identified priority programs.1 ' These plans provide for additional expenditures beyond
what was programmed in the base case expenditure program that is consistent with the PRGF
program and the updated DSA (See Figure 1). The PRGF program and the updated macroeconomic
scenario envisaged a rapid fiscal adjustment, an increasing flow of grants from bilateral donors and
the EU to meet the external financing needs and a contraction of borrowing by Rwanda, in order to
reach the debt sustainability targets in the medium-term. Figure 2 shows the estimates of the flows of

social services to the poor. The third and
.........
.unconstrainedscenario (page 136 of the

~

PRSP) reflects the estimates by the various
sector mninistries of the amounts that would
be needed for the sectoral programs to meet the poverty reduction objectives. This scenario, with
public expenditures in excess of 30 percent of GDP, is unlikely to be feasible from the financing and
absorptive capacity considerations. We therefore limit discussion of the financing needs to the
second scenario.

See: Repubhc of Rwanda: Poverty Reduction Stategy Paper, June 2002, page 126 to 147 for the two altemative scenarios.

41Annex 6

6.
Scenario 2 proposes the expansion of public spending for economic infrastructure,
agriculture, rural public works and land titling and shelter for the homeless, and the acceleration of
programs for education including adult literacy, HIV/AIDS, and health, particularly malaria, the
improvement of health services, and the expansion of the health insurance for the poor (mutuelles).
Economic infrastructure receives emphasis in the spending plans, reflecting the view of the
authorities that poor infrastructure has isolated many rural areas from the markets for their products
thus hindering the development of the rural areas, and further, that poor infrastructure constrains the
competitiveness of Rwanda's private sector and the expansion of exports. Thus, the PRSP envisages
the need to step-up public investments on energy and transportation infrastructure, in partnership
with the private sector, and to promote private investments in the telecommunications sector. The
expenditure programs in this scenario are seen as essential for economic transformation through
broad-based growth in rural economic activity, the private sector including small and medium size
enterprises, and in export trade.

the PRSP.1 The financing of the program as planned is not likely to be available and the envisaged
rapid expansion of public expenditures would strain the implementation capacity of the Government.
The Government, supported by DFID, is conducting a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA)
that will provide guidance on the appropriate levels of spending for rapid poverty reduction and longterm sustainability in Rwanda. The base-case expenditure program will be revised in light of the
results of the PSIA.

8.
From the preliminary analysis, the PSIA is likely to recommend an increase in the base-case
expenditure program in the medium-term but not to the levels envisaged in scenario 2. The PSIA
would also recommend for flexibility in the program to allow for increases in expenditures, as
resources become available. One practical way to address the financing and capacity constraints is to
stretch the implementation of the proposed programs over, say 6 years rather 4 years proposed in the
PRSP. Thus, these programs would add an average US$73 million per year to the base case amounts
and the GoR would seek additional grants and concessional loans to finance them.
Prospectsfor External assistance

9.
Grants: Over the last seven years, Rwanda has benefited from generous grants from the
European Union and bilateral donors in its post-conflict reconstruction efforts and development
program. However, overall donor support for the development program has been fragile and the flow
of committed grants unpredictable. This unpredictability of resource flows has been a difficult

The PRSP contains program costings for only 2002-2004. Staffs have extrapolated for the 2005 numbers.

pubhc spending needs are higher.

42Annex 6

challenge in managing the budget and the effective use of external assistance. Efforts are underway
to address this problem in the context of the new partnership program under the PRSP but this
process will take some time to show results. Prospects for increased level and predictability of grant
funding are improving, with the completion of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the
initiation of implementation of the strategy and recent improvements in the prospects for peace in the
region and the actions Rwanda has taken in this regard.
10.
In the context of peace in the region, the extensive socio-economic reforms and the record of
prudent macroeconomic management would create the conditions that are conducive to aid
effectiveness, and combined with Rwanda's relative poverty, would attract external assistance to
Rwanda. At a recent GoR/Development Partners Meeting in Kigali in November 2002, some donors
made specific pledges to increase the level of their support and/or to begin new co-operation with
Rwanda. Nevertheless, Rwanda has to compete with many other needy countries for the grants from
the donor community. Although the prospects currently look good, the Updated Scenario already
embodies a rapid increase in grants in the medium-term (see Figure 2) and it would not be prudent to
assume further increases in grants from bilaterals and the EU to meet the additional financing needs
of a modified scenario 2.
11.
IDA Lending: The IDA and the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) have been the principal sources of concessional lending
to Rwanda since 1994. Other multilaterals such as the OPEC Fund, the Saudi Fund and BADEA are
reengaging with Rwanda but their level of lending will likely remain low relative to IDA and AfDB.
With the high level of grants assumed in the program, multilateral lending would provide the cushion
for resource flows to Rwanda in case of shortfalls in grant financing. IDA is the preferred source of
such financing for Rwanda because of the relatively superior performance of its portfolio and the
technical services that come with IDA credits. In the Updated Scenario, total disbursements from
multilateral lending would decline to a level of about US$40 million a year in FY03-FY05, and
remain at this level thereafter. Thus, to be consistent with debt sustainability as defined in the
Updated Scenario, disbursements from IDA credits would be about US$30 million a year requiring
IDA commitments of about US$150 million in FY03-05.
12.
However, with the prospects of an increase in spending to accommodate the programs in
Scenario 2 of the PRSP, IDA should be prepared to provide additional financing. The IDA allocation
to Rwanda from the performance based IDA resource allocation process would be the ceiling for
IDA support. With this allocation currently at US$317 million for FY03-05 including possibly
US$100 million of IDA grants, the IDA support to Rwanda would be in the range of US$250-317
million, with the lower range consisting of US$150 in credits and US$100 million in IDA13 grants.
Thus the IDA13 Grants program would enable IDA to provide more support without adversely
affecting the debt sustainability prospects. However, support at the upper level of the range, which is
needed to fully support the PRSP, would still pose debt sustainability risks without additional actions
in the medium-term to mitigate debt sustainability risks. The following paragraphs analyze the
measures that Rwanda, its partners and IDA would take to mitigate the risks.
Managing Debt Sustainability
13.
Rwanda reached the eHIPC Decision Point in December 2000 just as it started to implement
the institutional reforms for its transition from conflict to a decentralized and democratic state. In
2001, the prices of its export commodities collapsed leading to a deterioration of its debt
sustainability indicators, demonstrating the significant risks to debt sustainability and the need to

-43-

Annex 6
closely monitor its evolution and to take actions accordingly. Rwanda remains committed to longterm debt sustainability and a progressive reduction on its dependence on external financial aid. To
these ends, it is intensifying efforts to mobilize domestic resources and donor grants, progressively
reduce budget deficits, make efficient use of its resources, and increase and diversify exports. The
long-term target for government expenditure remains at 20 percent of GDP, with a slowdown in
expenditure growth after the transition period. Revenues will be progressively increased from 11.4
percent of GDP in 2001 to about 13 percent in 2006. Exports should also recover in the medium-term
from the actions already taken or underway to promote private sector, liberalize trade, privatize and
rehabilitate the facilities for producing and processing export commodities, and promote nontraditional exports.
Prospeclsfor higher expors

14.
Rwanda's problem with debt sustainability stems from its poor export performance. The ratio
of export of goods and non-factor services to GDP for Rwanda is very low, and declined from 14.4
percent in 1980 to 8.3 percent in 2000.14 In contrast, the same ratio for SSA countries, excluding
Nigeria and South Africa, increased from 28 percent in 1980 to 33 percent in 2000. During Rwanda's
"lost decade" of the 1990s, exports declined in real terms at 1.8 percent per annum and currently,
exports are lower in nominal dollar terms than 15 years ago. The volume of coffee exports dropped
from 46,000 metric tons in 1990 to 16,000 tons in 2000. Tea exports stagnated, dropping from 12,000
metric tons in 1990 to 3,000 tons in 1996 and recovering to 13,000 tons in 2000. Rwanda's tea is of
high quality, the industry is relatively young, and is still far from meeting its potential.
15.
The PRSP identified export development as a major source of growth for Rwanda. The
strategic challenge for Rwanda is to rebuild its export base and in the process generate economic
growth, create employment, and improve the capacity to borrow in a sustainable manner. There is
considerable scope for increasing the volume and improving quality of tea and coffee exports. In this
regard, the Government has developed and is implementing a plan to revive coffee production and to
target Rwanda's coffee to the specialty coffee market, the fastest growing segment of the coffee
market. Rwanda has the natural conditions to grow the coffees for this market and needs to invest in
improving processing of the coffee. The privatization of the tea factories will significantly improve
tea production and quality.
16.
A return to peace in the region would revive tourism and mining, and encourage export
manufactures, food and services to regional markets. The Government is currently developing a plan
to boost tourism and plans to prepare a policy and plan to stimulate the mining sector. Rwanda has
good climatic conditions for high value export crops and a disciplined labor force for light
manufacturing and service industries for exports. The policy and institutional reforms including the
liberalization of the trade and foreign exchange regimes, and the use of private/public partnership to
support the process of improving the competitiveness of the private sector, strengthen the foundation
for export development. Rwanda needs the support of its development partners in its drive for export
growth and the Bank, the USAID and the EU have been the key partners in this effort.

14

In 2000, Rwanda's exports to GDP ratio was the second lowest inthe world.

44Annex 6
Acdons by the InternaiondCommunity
17.
Increasing levels and predictability of grants, possible additional debt relief at the completion
point of the Enhanced HIPC, and effective technical and financial support for the implementing
PRSP, will contribute to poverty reduction and enhance long-term debt sustainability. Flexibility and
predictability of these grants would enhance aid-effectiveness. The Decision Point DSA as well as
the Updated Scenario (see Figure 2) project increasing flow of grants over the medium-term. Meeting
these targets would be essential for the successful implementation of the PRSP.
Debt Sustainability Scenarios
18.
We explore quantitatively in the DSA framework the impact of on NPVRs of (i) the high end
of the range of the proposed IDA base case assistance program in the CAS without and without the
IDA Grants, and (ii) possible additional debt relief at eHIPC Completion Point. Figure 3 shows the
results of the simulations.

19.
IDA Lending and Grants: The IDA base case assistance program is in the range of
US$250-317 million. The first simulation examines the impact of lending (no grants) at the top of the
range in 2003-2005 and, beyond 2005, disbursements from the credits of multilaterals is assumed to
remain at US$80 million a year. The last assumption implies a decline of lending in real terms over
time, corresponding to the progressive decline of govemment deficits. As shown in Figure 3 (base
case lending), NPVRs decline from a peak of 203 in 2004 to 165 in 2019 but remain substantially
above the NPVRs of the Updated Scenario.
20.
As stated in the IDA13 replenishment Board document, approved on July 25, 2002, poorest
IDA-only countries vulnerable to longer-term debt sustainability may qualify for up to 40 percent of
their total IDA allocations provided in grant form. With per capita income $220 in 2001 and facing
long-term debt sustainability problems, Rwanda is eligible for the facility. The IDA Grant facility has

<
-

45-

Annex 6
been approved only for FY03-FY05 and Rwanda has received an allocation for FY03. The
proportion of grants that Rwanda may qualify has been decided only for FY03 and we assume that
the proportion of grants would be the same for FY04 and FY05 as in FY03. Figure 3 (base case incl
IDA grants up to FY05) shows that the substitution of IDA grants in FY03-05 for equivalent amounts
of credits reduces the NPVRs to the range of 155-180 in 2002-2019, thus helps lower the NPVRs
within the 150-200 percent NPV of debt-to-exports.
21.
Possible additional debt relief at the Completion Point: Under the existing HIPC
framework, additional debt relief may be granted in cases where severe exogenous shocks bring
about fundamental adverse changes in the debt sustainability outlook. As mentioned above, Rwanda
has suffered significant deterioration in its external sector due to commodity price declines and a
global economic slowdown. While a full assessment would need to be made at the Completion Point,
including an updated DSA at that time, Figure 3 also shows the potential positive impact of topping
up in securing a viable long-term debt outlook.
Implications for IDA Strategy
22.
The prospect of converting part of the IDA13 lending envelope into grants for low-income
countries with long-term debt sustainability problems helps to allay these concerns. Additional
actions, including possible consideration of additional debt relief at Completion Point of the
Enhanced HIPC, and higher and predictable flows of grants from donors would enable Rwanda
maintain a debt position within the 150-200 percent NPV of debt-to-exports cushion built into the
enhanced HIPC Initiative while sustaining its growth and poverty reduction efforts.
17.
The continuation of strong support by the Bank is essential for Rwanda to sustain its
economic and social recovery and for the resources for the economic transformation that it seeks,
including the development of exports. In this context, IDA lending will be flexible, within the limits
of Rwanda's allocation in the IDA performance based resource allocation process, and taking into
consideration the availability of grants from donors. The Bank will continue to support the
development of the capacity for export production, monitor the evolution of the debt sustainability,
and help to introduce assistance procedures, such as sector-wide approaches (SWAPs) that will
facilitate the substitution of donor grants for IDA conmmitments without impairing the effectiveness
of assistance.
18.
The range of IDA assistance proposed in the CAS gives the Bank the flexibility to limit
lending commitments to the low end of the range in order to avoid any deterioration of debt
sustainability indicators. However, this would need to be accompanied by increased donor grants to
ensure adequate resources for the implementation of the PRSP. In such a case, the Bank will
approach the donors for enhanced grant assistance. Furthermore, if Rwanda's performance were to
justify a high case program, the Bank would also approach the donors for enhanced grant assistance.
The possible topping up of the Enhanced HIPC would provide IDA greater flexibility to adjust its
level of assistance in response to performance and to continue to provide assistance if exogenous
shocks were to reduce export earnings resulting in the deterioration of debt sustainability indicators.
