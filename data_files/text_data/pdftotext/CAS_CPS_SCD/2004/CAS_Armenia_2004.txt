Executive Summary
Context. Armenia i s a small, landlocked country with few natural resources in a historically
volatile part o f the world. The country experienced a major economic contraction at the end o f the
1980s when the effects o f a massive earthquake were amplified by the break up o f the Soviet U n i o n
and the costs o f the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabagh. Over the last ten years, the
Government has shown a strong track record on economic management and reform, and has made
good use o f the high levels o f official donor support it has received. Armenia had the highest IDA
performance record in the E C A region in 2003.
1.

..

Economic Performance. The economy has recovered well from the post-1988 collapse, with
economic growth reaching 14% in 2003. At the beginning o f the recovery, growth was concentrated
in a narrow set o f industries, but, since 2000, the base has begun to broaden. Although poverty
remains widespread, it has been falling since the late 1990s. Extreme poverty has fallen more than
overall poverty, but the rate o f improvement in both measures has lagged behind economic growth.
Most o f the reductions in poverty have been seen in Yerevan, with poverty in other urban areas
falling less rapidly, and in rural areas remaining stagnant.
11.

...

Areas that require further attention. Despite this substantial progress, there are some key
issues that need to be addressed if strong growth i s to continue, and poverty reduction i s to accelerate.
111.

The climate for private sector development needs to improve further. While Armenia has one
o f the most liberal business environments in the FSU, the public sector needs to become more
o f an asset -- rather than an administrative and financial cost -- to the private sector.

A larger share of the population needs to benefit from economic growth. With strong
economic growth expected to continue, more attention i s needed to increasing jobs, stimulating the rural economy, and improving the social protection systems.
The entire population needs better access to basic services. After independence basic
services, including education and healthcare, deteriorated sharply, and the Government needs
to persist in i t s efforts to improve their quality and efficiency.

iv.
Government Program. In October 2003, the Government published an ambitious yet
realistic Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which lays out i t s plan for reducing poverty and
inequality, and furthering human development. The policies and actions proposed can be grouped
into five categories: (i)
promoting sustainable economic growth through macro-economic stability
and private sector development; (ii)
enhancing human development and improving social safety nets;
(iii)implementing prudent fiscal policies; (iv) improving public infrastructure; and (v) improving
core public sector functions.
v.
IDA Strategy and Results. From the range o f interventions proposed in the PRSP, the CAS
focuses o n three areas which best fit the Bank Group’s comparative advantage and complement the
activities o f other donors. In each area, the CAS takes as i t s starting point long-term country goals,
and o n that basis defines specific results that can be achieved over the FY05-08 CAS period:
Promote private sector led economic growth. Achieving this goal will require better public
services, measured by an improvement in business perceptions o f government policies and
corruption, and by a strengthening o f the judicial system, measured by the level o f satisfaction
o f court users. IDA will also help Armenia strengthen the financial system, measured by an

increase in the ratio o f loans to GDP, and improve communications infrastructure, measured
by an increase in the number o f telecoms licenses issued.
0

0

Make growth more pro-poor. Achieving this goal will require accelerated j o b creation,
measured initially by a fall in the share o f the informal economy in GDP. I t will also require a
stronger rural economy, measured by an increase in value-added per hectare. Improvements
in the social protection system will be measured by an increase in user satisfaction. Overall,
the interventions in this category will contribute to a reduction in extreme poverty.
Reduce non-income poverty. Achieving this goal will require better access t o education,
healthcare and basic infrastructure services. Education outcomes will b e measured by the
extent to w h i c h children stay in the education system. Health outcomes will be measured by
service use among sick people in rural areas, and in the bottom consumption quintile.
Improvements in access t o basic infrastructure services will be measured by the share o f the
population with drinking water 24 hours a day.

vi.
IDA Instruments and Cases to Achieve the Results. IDA will support these goals through
the on-going and proposed portfolio, and through AAA services, including programmatic lending and
advisory w o r k to b e conducted j o i n t l y with the government throughout the C A S period. Armenia
became a High Case performer during the FY02-FY04 C A S period. I t will enter the up-coming C A S
in a Base Case, w h i c h assumes a continuation o f current good performance, and includes IDA lending
o f US$170 m i l l i o n over four years. If the improvements in public sector management accelerate,
Armenia will move into a High Case o f US$220 million, providing additional resources for structural
and public sector reform. I t i s possible that Armenia’s creditworthiness m a y improve towards the end
o f the upcoming C A S period, in which case IBRD funds might b e available for additional
investments in infrastructure. If Armenia i s unable t o continue its current good performance, it will
move into a L o w Case, which w o u l d restrict n e w investment operations t o those that directly protect
the most vulnerable, and w o u l d make available IDA lending o f US$90 m i l l i o n over four years.
vii.
Risks. Political change in the Caucasus region could affect Armenia negatively or positively.
Likewise, exogenous economic shocks -- such as sudden changes in the prices o f o i l o r other k e y
commodities -- could also have significant costs o r benefits. Within Armenia, political consensus for
reform could weaken, undermining progress in k e y sectors and possibly macroeconomic stability. A
deceleration in improvements in tax revenues and/or slower growth could increase the projected
financing gap t o the extent that expected adjustment lending and donor funding w o u l d be insufficient
to cover it. In addition, the country remains vulnerable to earthquakes and other natural disasters.
IDA aims to mitigate these risks through extensive analytical w o r k and dialogue and, in some cases,
investments. If, however, the situation deteriorates t o the extent that implementation o f the proposed
strategy becomes difficult, IDA will consult the Board o n a revised strategy.
viii.
Monitoring and Evaluation for Results. IDA will monitor the effectiveness o f i t s support
both at the project level and at the level o f the overall assistance program. The success o f the C A S
program will be measured against the expected C A S results, w h i c h are derived f r o m PRSP targets.
IDA will use the results framework in its Portfolio Reviews, and will consult with c i v i l society o n
C A S progress as part o f the Government’s regular PRSP consultations. At the mid-point o f the C A S
period, IDA will review the indicators and targets t o assess progress in implementing the assistance
program, and adjust the strategy as necessary.

WORLD BANK COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR
THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA
1. Introduction
1.
Armenia i s located in the Caucasus Region, neighboring Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkey. With a GNP per capita o f US$910 in 2003, Armenia ranks in the lower middle-income group o f
countries. Emigration and declining fertility has reduced its population, which was 3.8 million ten
years ago, to about 3.1 million today. Because Armenia i s small, landlocked and mountainous, w i t h
few natural resources, it faces economic disadvantages compared w i t h many o f its neighbors. These
disadvantages have, however, been off-set to some extent by the country’s high levels o f human
capital, an active diaspora, and high levels o f remittances and external assistance (which averaged
11% o f GDP over the last five years). Armenia i s vulnerable to a wide range o f external shocks
arising from its location in a historically volatile geo-political environment, and i t s susceptibility to
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts, frosts, hailstorms, and floods.
2.
Armenia achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then the economy
has changed profoundly. Heavy industry collapsed as the Soviet Union broke up, and i s gradually
being replaced by services, light industry, and construction. As this economic transformation has
taken hold, GDP growth has accelerated from 3.3% in 1999 to 13.9% in 2003. The Government’s
forceful steps to create a more favorable business environment and improve public institutions helped
accelerate growth rates. Membership o f international bodies such as the WTO and the Council o f
Europe have added impetus to maintaining and deepening reforms. Barring any destabilizing
economic shock, the prospects for GDP and export growth remain favorable.
3.
The major challenge for the Government during this CAS period will be to create the conditions that will allow growth to benefit a much larger share o f the Armenia population. While overall
poverty f e l l from 56% o f the population in 1998/99 to 49% in 2002, and extreme poverty from 26%
to 17%, a more rapid improvement might have been expected from the rapid GDP growth. The 2003
PRSP emphasizes the Government’s commitment to equitable growth and sustained poverty reduction across the whole country. When the World Bank’s Executive Board discussed the PRSP, and
associated Joint Staff Assessment, in December 2003, it concluded that the PRSP provides a sound
basis for IDA concessional assistance. This CAS i s accordingly based on the PRSP’s priorities.

4.
Armenia has had a relatively stable political situation over the past few years, with strong
support for reforms from both the executive and legislative branches. Presidential and legislative
elections in early 2003 resulted in re-election o f President Kocharian and coalition within Parliament,
which continues to support the PRSP and medium-term agenda. However, the electoral process i t s e l f
was criticized at the time, and opposition parties have since stepped up demands for a nationwide
referendum o f confidence, which has been rejected by the Parliament. While the overall environment
i s s t i l l supportive, there will clearly be a heightened need for consensus building to support the reform
program in the years ahead.

2. Economic Management
2.I Transformation since Independence
Armenia’s transformation from a centrally planned Soviet system to a successful market
5.
economy has had three major phases.

6.
The first phase, lasting for the first two years after Armenia’s 1991 declaration o f independence, was marked by a contraction in GDP o f 50%. While GDP f e l l in all FSU economies after the
break-up o f the Soviet Union, the situation in Armenia was particularly severe, exacerbated by a
heavy dependence o n uncompetitive Soviet heavy industry, by the after-effects o f the 1988
earthquake, and by the direct and indirect costs o f the conflict over Nagorno-Karabagh. The full
impact o f this economic contraction was alleviated to some degree by farm privatization, which took
place at this time, and allowed subsistence agriculture to act as a safety net, absorbing many o f the
displaced workers. Farm output rose to over 50% o f a sharply reduced GDP by 1993.

7.
The second phase o f the transformation to a market economy began in 1994, and was marked
by a successful stabilization and structural reform program. The program focused initially o n fiscal
and monetary policies designed to deal with hyper-inflation (which reached 5000% in 1994), and
uncontrolled fiscal spending (the budget deficit reached 56% o f GDP in 1993). Stabilization was
accompanied by liberalization o f trade and prices, privatization o f small and medium enterprises, and
the creation o f the basic legal and administrative framework for a market economy. These reforms --

and other positive factors such as the ceasefire over Nagorno-Karabagh -- fostered sustained
economic expansion (see Table 1). Growth averaged 5.5% in 1994-2000, and the composition o f
GDP changed considerably, with agriculture declining again in relative terms, and the construction
and trade sectors growing rapidly.

The third phase began in mid-2000, and saw an increased government focus on improving
the overall business environment, and the supporting framework for investment. This contributed to
rapid growth rates, with GDP expanding by almost 13% in 2002, and 14% in 2003. M u c h o f this
growth was driven by construction, and by exports o f polished diamonds. Nonetheless the sectoral
base o f the economy has begun to broaden, with total exports excluding diamonds increasing rapidly
(Table 2). Industrial output in particular i s starting to grow again, but, unlike in Soviet times, it i s
now concentrated in light and medium-sized manufacturing and a growing agro-processing sector.

2.2 Current €conomic Management
9.
Macroeconomic management remains sound. Fiscal balances continue to be sustainable, w i t h
a budget deficit o f 1.5% o f GDP in 2003 (below the target o f 2.2%, in part because o f undermns on
projected expenditures). Nonetheless, government revenues remain l o w by CIS standards, amounting
to less than 15% o f GDP. The Government i s committed to improving tax collection, and reforms
introduced at the end o f 2003 seem to be having an impact, with tax revenue in the first three months
o f 2004 18% higher than in the same period in 2003.
10.
The principal short-term macroeconomic concern has been inflation, which rose to a relatively
high 8.6 percent by the end o f 2003. However, the main cause was a sudden increase in the prices o f
imported wheat flour and cereals, with monetary policy playing at most a minor role. By April 2004,
the 12-month rate o f inflation had fallen to 7.8 percent, and the Armenian Dram remained broadly
stable.

11.
The Government has sharply reduced the once burdensome quasi-fiscal deficit. Most o f this
improvement came from the privatization o f the electricity distribution companies, which has turned
an energy sector deficit o f 2% o f GDP in 2000 into a surplus now. In addition the water supply and
irrigation sectors are, with IDA support for management contracts and decentralization, reducing their
deficits from a combined 1% o f GDP in 2001 to a projected 0.4 percent o f GDP in 2004.
12.
Despite this overall fiscal progress, public revenue management and generation s t i l l fall short
o f what i s needed for Armenia to deliver public services commensurate with i t s rapidly rising GDP.
The budget preparation process i s insufficiently strategic, and the links between the annual budgets,
the M T E F and the PRSP also need to be stronger. Likewise, the l i n e ministries need to play a more
active role in budget formulation and to share accountability for budget outcomes. Local
governments have insufficient financial management and budgeting capacity, and lack transparency.
13.
O n the revenue side, administration o f VAT, personal income and payroll taxes, and
especially customs, need to be greatly strengthened i f Armenia’s revenue potential i s to be realized.
L o w tax collection i s a result o f governance shortcomings, a large informal economy, and an
unnecessarily complicated tax system, w i t h excessive numbers o f specific exemptions and a highly
complex corporate tax structure.
The investment climate continues to improve. Progress in trade and price liberalization,
14.
increased investments in infrastructure, privatization or closure o f most state-owned enterprises, and

-3-

efforts to streamline government regulation, have enhanced the business environment to the extent
that the latest Heritage Foundation Index o f Economic Freedom ranks Armenia highest among the
CIS countries, and above even some OECD countries.
15.
An important challenge for future private sector growth will be to strengthen Armenia’s
under-developed financial sector. Commercial bank lending, as measured by the stock o f debt
outstanding, has actually fallen by 11% from December 2000 to M a r c h 2004. While deposits have
increased significantly, the resulting extra liquidity has not yet found i t s w a y into lending to corporate
clients. In part this i s because of the time it has taken to purge insolvent banks from the system -- it
was only in 2003 that the banking system as a whole became profitable. Furthermore, a significant
volume o f diaspora funding for investment activity is not channeled through the banking system.

2.3 The €conomic Outlook
16.
The medium-term growth prospects for Armenia are positive, bolstered by continuing sound
economic management and the growing dynamism o f export sectors, including light industry and
agro-processing. Official donor support i s likely to remain strong, and recent positive developments
in Georgia should also benefit Armenia. The baseline macroeconomic projections shown in Table 3
reflect a convergence o f World Bank, IMF and PRSP projections and estimates, and are conservative.

Armenia’s external debt i s manageable, and i s expected to continue to decline over the
medium term. The country’s external debt profile improved considerably in April 2003, when an
agreement with Russia to implement a debt-for-equity swap went into effect. Russian enterprises
acquired equity in several major state-owned enterprises in Armenia in exchange for US$94 million
o f government debt. This, in addition to the in-kind repayment o f the US$12 million outstanding to
Turkmenistan, helped to eliminate the most expensive part o f Armenia’s external debt burden, and
thereby improved the country’s external debt indicators. By the end o f 2003, government and
government-guaranteed external debt was 39% o f GDP, with about 80% from multilateral concessional sources, o f which IDA accounted for 60%.
18.
The PRSP projections o f firmly secured financing leave an unsecured gap o f about US$50
million a year for 2004-08 (after projected IDA disbursements for investment projects).’ IDA
adjustment lending would fill about $15 million a year o f this gap in the Base Case, and about $20
million in the High Case (see Section 6.4 below), leaving a residual financing need o f $30-35 million.
This remaining gap i s not, however, o f immediate concern, since the Government’s projections take
into account only firmly identified sources o f financing -- the projections assume grants o f only $2025 m i l l i o n a year in 2004-07, considerably less than the actual volume o f grant assistance in 2003.
Funding from the U S Government’s Millennium Challenge Account, which Armenia recently
qualified for, could also provide significant additional finance for Armenia’s investment needs.

If GDP growth and/or the revenue collection rate are slower than expected, the expected financing gap will grow.
The incidence o f poverty i s the share o f poor people in the population; the poverty gap indicates h o w far below the

poverty line poor households are; and the severity o f poverty captures inequality among the poor.

Inequality, measured by surveys of consumption, however, appears
to be much lower (a Gini coefficient o f 0.27), although relatively
stagnant (Table 5). These large differences between the income and
consumption inequality measures may be caused by measurement
errors.

rates remain high despite the accelerating GDP growth. New j o b
creation has yet to compensate for the volume o f labor shedding,
which has taken place as a result o f the sharp transition process.
According to the household surveys, which are based on self-reporting,
unemployment overall was 29% in 2002, down only 2 percentage
points from 2001, w i t h most o f the decline being in Yerevan, where
unemployment f e l l by 7 percentage points between 2001 and 2002 (see
Table 6).4 Official data gives substantially lower rates than the
household survey, as many unemployed people do not register with the
Labor Office.

Social transfers represent the third largest source o f income (after labor income and
remittances) for Armenia’s poorest households, and the family poverty benefit in particular has
proved to be an effective mechanism for reaching the poor -- for each percent o f GDP spent on the
family poverty benefit, extreme poverty falls by 3.4 percentage points, and overall poverty by 2.4
percentage point^.^ In 2002, the Government reduced spending on poverty benefits by one-third o f a
percent o f GDP, resulting in an 11% fall in the number o f beneficiaries, and a 15% decline in the
average monthly benefit. This may have slowed improvements in poverty between 2001 and 2002.
In 2004, however, poverty benefits were restored to their former levels and social assistance arrears
were cleared, which may have a positive impact on poverty in 2004.

The health o f the Armenian population deteriorated after the economic collapse, but since
2000 there have been indications that conditions are starting to improve. While data problems make
definite conclusions difficult, Government figures indicate that under-five mortality f e l l from 25 per
1,000 live births to 19 per 100,000 between 2001 and 2003.6 These trends mask a significant difference between rural and urban areas, with rural infant and child mortality rates exceeding urban rates
by 47 percent and 22 percent, respectively, during the 1990s. The Government has embarked o n a
reform program to increase public expenditure on healthcare, improve i t s targeting, and reduce excess
hospital capacity.
26.
Access to basic education i s good, with a net enrollment rate o f 92% in 2001. In contrast, the
net enrollment rate in secondary schools i s only 61%’ and even lower for the poorest quintile (52%).
Boys are particularly likely to drop out because o f problems both o f supply (poor quality o f teaching),
and demand (low expectations o f jobs aAer completing education). The Government i s working to
improve the quality o f education, and has begun to make expenditure more efficient, for example by
consolidating underutilized schools to improve their effectiveness. Overall public expenditures o n
education are also rising (by 45% between 1997 and 2001), but they are s t i l l l o w by FSU standards.
High quality textbooks are now available to all at a reasonable cost, and 40% o f schools now have
some managerial and financial autonomy.

3.2 Millennium Development Goals
27.
Armenia has already met the gender MDG, and i s likely to meet the poverty and education
goals, and possibly also the environment goal (see Table 7 below). The health goals, however, appear
less likely to be met by the target year o f 2015, with child mortality s t i l l more than twice the goal, TB
rates increasing, and maternal mortality remaining a serious problem. IDA i s continuing to support
Armenia’s efforts to meet and exceed the MDGs, w i t h particular emphasis, both in the current
portfolio and in the proposed PRSCs, on the health goals. In addition, IDA i s continuing to help
finance improvements throughout Armenia in drinking water and sanitation systems, as well as in
natural resource management, rural development, and energy reform.
28.
A recent exercise to assess the costs o f meeting the MDGs estimated that Armenia would need
about US$25 million per year in addition to the currently proposed allocation for the four-year period
2005-08 to cover the costs o f public expenditures that would be required to meet the MDGs. This
assumes that Armenia would receive U S 3 5 million annually from private foundations and other
donors.

Armenia has an average o f only 25,000 births a year. The rate per 100,000 live births therefore
fluctuates widely, making it impossible to d e t e m n e a trend. In addition, Armenia has child and matemal
mortality rates that are l o w for i t s income level, which make the MDG targets unrealistic, since they
require reducing MMR by 75% and child mortality by 66% over 15 years, which would give Armenia
rates better than those in most high-income countries. Therefore, if Armenia manages to bring its child
and maternal mortality rates up to those o f high-income countries, the country will be considered to have
met the targets.

4. Lessons from Previous CASs
4.1 The CAS Completion Report
29.
The FY02-04 CAS focused on promoting private sector development, improving public sector
management, and enhancing human development, and was broadly successful in supporting these
goals. The Completion Report for the FY02-04 CAS (Annex 2) highlights the following lessons:
0

The FY02-04 CAS objectives were appropriate, and should b e broadly continued. However,
given the continuing disparity between overall growth rates and poverty reduction, this CAS
pays more explicit attention to ensuring broad access to the benefits o f growth.

The best results were achieved when IDA was able to exploit the synergies between wellsequenced analytical work and lending (both investment and adjustment), and when it was
able to leverage trust funds and other donors’ support. This CAS thus pays close attention to
the sequencing o f initiatives, and ensuring that support for reform will be based o n good
analytical underpinnings.

A strong, high caliber multi-sector team in the Yerevan Country Office was important in
designing appropriate interventions, and maintaining a high level o f dialogue with senior
officials. Moving portfolio management and some task management responsibilities to the
Country Office also helped improve portfolio performance. Both trends will continue under
this CAS.
The outcome indicators for the FY02-04 CAS should have been linked more clearly to IDA
interventions in order to facilitate evaluation o f CAS performance. This CAS consequently
l i n k s all targets to the associated interventions, and indicators in the results matrix (Annex 1)
will be used as a management tool throughout CAS implementation.

The FY02-04 CAS was not realistic enough about staff availability and programming.
Though the total number o f activities and lending volume were delivered roughly as planned,
there was some slippage due to lack o f timely availability o f key staff. Bank management will
pay explicit attention to staff programming during implementation o f this CAS.
The CAS consultation process was extensive, and largely coincided with the even more
thorough Government-led consultation process for the PRSP. The Government i s committed
to continue consultations throughout PRSP implementation, and IDA will participate in that
process. Consultations o n this CAS have also been coordinated with PRSP discussions, and
focused o n the most effective way for IDA to support Armenia’s PRSP priorities.

4.2 OED S Country Assistance &ahation
30.
The World Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department prepared an independent assessment o f
the role o f World Bank Group’s assistance to Armenia between 1993 and 2002.7 The report found
that the substantial levels o f assistance was well used: 86% o f the projects reviewed had satisfactory
outcomes, with high relevance, substantial institutional development impact and excellent linkages
between analytical work and lending, as well as mutually supportive investment and adjustment
operations. OED found that IDA lending should have focused earlier and more intensively o n
improving the business climate and public sector management. The evaluation also concluded that
Armenia needed to strengthen i t s aid coordination capacity. The report recommended: (a) preparing a
strategy for an eventual transition to IBRD lending; (b) continuing to focus o n improving the
environment for private sector development; and (c) following through o n support for public sector
reform. Management agreed w i t h each o f the recommendations and has incorporated them centrally
into this Country Assistance Strategy.

4.3 Results Achieved

The Bank’s assistance over the FY02-04 CAS period has, in active cooperation with other
development partners, had a tangible impact on the ground in a number o f areas. A few examples
are:

The business environment. The support provided through Structural Adjustment Credits
(SACS) IV and V, as well as other instruments, helped produce a measurable improvement in
the business environment. For example, the number o f steps necessary to register an
enterprise has been cut by one third, and Government inspections have been reduced by half,
significantly improving the business environment. Businesses’ perceptions o f all fields o f
regulatory and tax-related obstacles have improved since 2000, as reported in regular business
surveys.
The energy and water sectors. IDA helped lay the framework for the privatization o f the
energy distribution companies, which, while i t occurred later than expected, has now
eliminated the once heavy burden o f energy distribution o n the budget (2% o f GDP in 2001).
IDA also helped increase the efficiency o f the power utilities w i t h the result that almost the
entire population n o w has uninterrupted electricity supply, and tariff collection i s close to
100%. W i t h support from IDA, drinking water services in Yerevan have improved markedly.
In 2001, only 10% o f the city’s population had water for 12 hours per day, whereas by March
2004, h a l f o f the population had 24 hour service.
Governance. C i v i l service reform has begun under a new law, which IDA advised on. In
addition, IDA has helped bring government and c i v i l society organizations draft an AntiCorruption Strategy, which was adopted and launched by the President in January 2004.
Rural development. IDA has assisted in rehabilitating 4,000 km o f irrigation canals, which
have increased the productivity o f some 140,000 hectares o f agricultural land, 74% o f all
irrigated land in the country. In addition, some 760 km o f roads are maintained on a routine
basis under IDA-assisted projects. IDA has also improved the lives o f some 674,000 people
through small community projects supporting improvement o f schools, local potable water
systems, small irrigation systems, and rural health facilities.
Education and health. W i t h IDA assistance, the Government has taken steps to make the
healthcare more responsive to the needs o f the poor. I t has designed, and i s about to
implement, a major reform strategy to rationalize excess facilities that will free up funds for
increased spending o n essential services. I t has set up a system o f family doctors, and i s
shifting more public spending to primary healthcare. To improve education outcomes, IDA
has helped the Government begin a major reform program to increase efficiency and improve
the quality o f education. Forty percent o f schools now have some managerial and financial
autonomy, and parents are increasingly involved in school management. W i t h the support o f
an IDA credit, high quality textbooks are now available in all schools at reasonable cost.

0

Social protection. IDA has helped the Government design and implement a family benefit
system, which i s an effective and well-targeted means to support poor households. IDA has
helped the Government clear i t s arrears and improve social insurance, social welfare and
employment services. With support from IDA, the Government has drafted a new Labor
Code to facilitate j o b creation and a more flexible labor market.

5. Government Program
32.
In October 2003 the Government published i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
which promotes the goals of: (i)
reducing poverty; (ii)
lowering inequality; and (iii)
improving human
development.* The World Bank-IMF Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) o f the PRSP concluded that the
strategy was a significant achievement in the Government’s effort to foster growth and reduce
poverty, and endorsed i t s analysis and recommendations.’ The JSA concluded that the PRSP was
prepared through a broad participatory process, was based on a comprehensive analysis o f poverty,
contained a sound diagnosis o f needed short- and long-term reforms and investments, and used
realistic costing and financing assumptions. The JSA recommended additional work on monitoring
and evaluation, further prioritization o f proposed interventions, and close integration o f the PRSP
w i t h the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and the annual budgets.
33.
The PRSP sees growth and poverty reduction coming primarily from a more dynamic and
competitive private sector, with the Government’s role focusing on promoting a better business
climate, improving the level and efficiency o f social sector expenditures, and reducing waste and
corruption. The PRSP also identifies infrastructure investments (including in health) as having an
especially high return.
34.
The policies and actions proposed in the PRSP can be grouped into five categories: (i)
promoting sustainable economic growth through macroeconomic stability and private sector development;
(ii)
enhancing human development and improving social safety nets; (iii)
implementing prudent fiscal
policies; (iv) improving public infrastructure; and (v) improving core public sector functions. Table 1
in Annex 7 divides the policy actions (p 1-p186 as described in Annex 7 o f the PRSP) among the three
PRSP goals, and Table 2 in the same annex groups them into the five themes identified in the JSA.

6. Bank Strategy
From the broad range o f interventions proposed in the PRSP, the CAS focuses o n three areas which
best fit the Bank Group’s comparative advantage and complement the activities o f other donors: (i)
promoting private sector growth by strengthening the financial sector, improving public sector
management, and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; (ii)making growth more pro-poor by
improving the labor market, promoting a more dynamic rural economy, and making social assistance
more effective; and (iii)
reducing non-income poverty through better health, education and basic
services. The main results that this CAS aims for, and the strategies for achieving them, are shown in
the summary results matrix, Table 8 below. Annex 1 provides a more detailed version, w i t h
additional baselines and targets for use during CAS implementation.

6. I Goal One: Promote private sector led economic growth
35.
Long-term strategic goal. The Government regards the private sector as the m a i n driver o f
the economic growth needed for employment creation and poverty reduction. The C A S aims to help
improve the environment for private sector growth, with a n emphasis on facilitating economic
diversification (both in terms o f the number o f sectors and the number o f enterprises).
Principal constraints. Although the business climate has improved greatly in the past f e w
36.
years, three areas will require continued close attention over the C A S period:

(a) A weak public sector constrains private sector entrepreneurship. Despite the
improvements in the business climate, interactions with the public sector can often b e a timeconsuming and unproductive burden on enterprises.
Surveys indicate that business
perceptions o f public sector performance worsened somewhat between 200 1 and 2003. Public
agencies at central and local levels tend t o lack motivated staff and transparent procedures.
Fiscal revenues are low and budget systems, w h i l e improved, need to become m o r e efficient
and transparent. Furthermore, public procurement remains opaque to potential bidders. T h e
j u d i c i a l system i s n o t yet completely independent, suffers f r o m long backlogs, does not
reliably enforce i t s decisions, and has outdated procedures to manage courtrooms and
integrate n e w legislation. Petty corruption i s commonplace, corporate accounting standards
v a r y considerably, and some sectors o f the economy are dominated by p o w e r f u l businesses
with close l i n k s t o the Government, w h i c h restricts competition and raises prices.

(b) The financial sector remains underdeveloped. A r m e n i a has made progress in consolidating

i t s banks (which dominate the financial sector) m a i n l y through increases in minimum capital
requirements. B a n k i n g assets, deposits and credit have increased somewhat, but the banking
system remains small compared t o the size o f the economy, and s t i l l suffers from low public
confidence. T h e sector suffers from inefficiencies, weak corporate governance, and p o o r l y
developed mechanisms for enforcing secured transactions, including a d i f f i c u l t debt recovery
process. The insurance sector, even in comparison with other C I S countries, remains small
and other financial services, such as credit bureaus and mortgages, are not available.

(c) The high cost and/or unreliability o f key infrastructure hinder growth. W h i l e m u c h of
Armenia’s h i g h w a y system i s in good condition, m a n y r u r a l roads have n o t been maintained.
T h i s restricts farmers’ a b i l i t y to market their crops and stifles the o f f - f a r m r u r a l economy. In
addition, Armenia’s restricted borders with T u r k e y and Azerbaijan have increased the costs o f
external trade. However, the area where A r m e n i a i s at the largest comparative disadvantage i s
telecommunications. A long-term m o n o p o l y license to A r m e n T e l has contributed to high cost
and low quality telecommunications, with restricted coverage in r u r a l areas and a l i m i t e d
range o f services (corporate networks and internet access are particularly problematic).
Results achievable in CAS period. T h e C A S proposes a range o f interventions to help the
37.
Government overcome these constraints, with the degree of success measured by progress towards
the results identified below:

(a) Government agencies provide better services. Improvements in the performance o f p u b l i c
sector agencies will b e measured by whether and at what rate business perceptions o f

-13-

government policies and corruption improve (from a base o f 2.98 and 2.84, respectively, in
2003 on a 4-point scale where 1 indicates no obstacle). Improvements in the judicial system
will be measured by an increase in court users’ satisfaction with judicial performance and
services. Several intermediate indicators are essential to achieving an improvement o f this
score (see the Results Matrix, Annex 1). The current portfolio contributes to these results
through the FY04 Public Sector Reform Credit, which tackles c i v i l service reform, public
procurement, e-government, and local government reform. Results relating to the judicial
system will be achieved through the FYOl Judicial Reform Project. Future lending, advisory
and analytical activities will also contribute. The series o f PRSCs and the PRSC Technical
Assistance credit”, are likely to tackle tax reform, increased transparency o f the budget
process at central and local levels, and application o f accounting standards amongst other
things. An FY07 Public Sector Project in the High Case would address a broad range o f
problems and thus contribute to further achievement o f these and related results. In the AAA
program, the follow-up to the Country Financial Accountability Assessment will help resolve
budget and auditing issues; financial sector advisory services will help improve corporate
governance, as will IDFs o n public procurement and competition policy. WBI’s planned
capacity-building program for local governments and training for civil servants will
complement the efforts o f the Public Sector Reform Credit. The Programmatic Public
Expenditure Reviews, and the Country Economic Memorandum, will help diagnose problems
and monitor outcomes, and the regular business surveys will help monitor results.

(b) The financial system intermediates an increasing share o f investment capital, as measured by the loans to GDP ratio increasing from 6% in 2003. IDA will influence this result by

supporting improvements in banking regulation and banking supervision, supporting
development and modernization o f the financial infrastructure including the payments system
and credit information bureaus. I t will also support efforts to develop the non-bank financial
sector and the overall business environment, such as improving creditors’ rights. IDA’Swill
provide this support through advisory services and analytical work (such as the Financial
Sector Advisory Notes and the C E M on pro-poor growth) carefully sequenced with
programmatic support to reforms through the series o f PRSCs. These new initiatives will
leverage reforms supported by the recently completed SAC V and on-going advisory and
capacity building activities. IDA will also support anti-money laundering and combating the
financing o f terrorism by helping the Government adopt comprehensive legislation, establish a
Financial Intelligence Unit, and train government and financial institution officials.

(c) Communications infrastructure i s less o f a constraint to private sector development.
Progress in removing infrastructure bottlenecks will b e measured by the increase (from a
current baseline o f 1) in the number o f telecoms licenses issued in the CAS period, and by
indicators relating to transport, which will be developed during the CAS period. Ongoing
work to address these issues includes the FYOO Transport Project; PPIAF grants to strengthen
the multi-sector utility regulator and to assess telecommunications in rural areas; and a
regional study on rural infrastructure. The proposed portfolio includes PRSC support for the
telecoms sector, a renewable energy project, a third Social Investment Fund, and an FY07
Infrastructure Project.
l o The Government intends to mobilize grant resources to fund technical assistance for key elements o f the reform agenda
to be supported by the PRSCs. Depending on the extent o f the grant support, the PRSC TA credit may be reduced or even
dropped.

6.2 Goal Two: Make growth more pro-poor
Long-term strategic goal. The PRSP puts a major emphasis o n ensuring that a larger share
38.
o f the population benefits from economic growth. The CAS program accordingly has a focus o n
helping make the benefits o f growth more widely available by improving formal sector jobs and
stimulating the rural economy. For those who are not yet able to share in these benefits, the CAS
focuses o n improving social protection.
Principal constraints. Three obstacles to ensuring that the poor benefit more from Arme39.
nia’s rapid economic growth will require close attention during the CAS period.

(a) Job creation has been sluggish and the informal sector i s large. The economy i s not
creating enough formal sector jobs, because f i r m s appear to have expanded by exploiting
under-utilized capital rather than increasing employment, and because governance problems
help sustain a high informal economy. Furthermore, labor skills are not always a good match
for the jobs that are available (see Section 6.3 below). These structural problems are in
themselves a major obstacle to fostering pro-poor growth, but even where there i s a potential
match between a j o b vacancy and an appropriately qualified person, deficiencies in the
information systems available to employers and j o b seekers often prevent the match actually
being made. Very few agencies effectively link employers with potential employees.

(b) R u r a l livelihoods have stagnated.

Although there are some dynamic developments in
agriculture overall, the livelihoods o f the rural poor have stagnated over the past few years.
Agriculture supports around 25% o f the country’s population, having absorbed the bulk o f
labor displaced by the economic contraction o f the 1990s. Production, however, remains
mostly at subsistence levels, w i t h farmers relying on barter much more than cash transactions
to dispose o f the small surpluses they do produce. Most farming i s l o w intensity (both capital
and labor), so underemployment in rural areas i s pervasive. Some areas o f the country are
simply not viable for agriculture over the long term, but, even in the fertile areas, there i s
limited farm specialization and intensification. Market infrastructure i s lacking (road
conditions are poor, there are no wholesale markets, and few cold or dry stores); marketing
institutions are underdeveloped; and machinery and input supplies are poorly organized. Land
holdings are small, and, as land markets have recently been established, consolidation i s only
just beginning. Farmers will need additional support to improve management o f irrigation
systems, and agriculture remains vulnerable to natural disasters. Although a growing number
o f successful agro-processing enterprises have emerged, and tourism i s developing in some
parts o f the country, most rural areas provide few opportunities for work outside agriculture.

(c) The social protection system could be more efficient. Social protection has improved
markedly in the past few years, with most benefits now w e l l targeted and no arrears in
payments to beneficiaries - indeed the 2001 Household Survey showed that transfers
accounted for 15% o f the income o f the poorest quintile. Nonetheless further improvements
in efficiency and effectiveness could produce marked benefits for the poorest: administration
o f many benefits needs to be more efficient to reduce waste and delays; the poverty benefit
needs to reach more o f the poor, particularly in rural areas; knowledge o f the benefit system
and clarity about i t s rules need to improve so more eligible beneficiaries register; and the level

-15-

o f pensions needs to be increased, since average pensions have fallen relative to average
wages from 33% in 1996 to 21% in 2003."
Results achievable in CAS period. The CAS proposes to help the Government overcome
40.
these constraints through an integrated series o f analytical work, capacity building, programmatic and
investment lending designed to achieve the following measurable results:

(a) The importance o f the informal sector in the economy declines. According to the PRSP,
the informal sector accounts for an estimated 45% o f the total economy, and the goal i s for
this to fall over the CAS period. As formal sector employment grows, people will move away
from informal sector jobs, gaining legal status, benefits, j o b security. The change will also
benefit Armenia's investment climate and fiscal revenues. The current portfolio contributes to
this goal through the FY04 Public Sector Reform Credit and the FYOl Judicial Reform Credit,
coordinated with capacity building work o n anti-corruption and procurement as well as
advisory work to improve corporate governance. In the future portfolio, the PRSCs and PRSC
TA will influence this objective, as will the Country Economic Memorandum, the
Programmatic Poverty Assessments, the Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews and the
Labor Market Study. The FY04 Social Protection Administration Project will help strengthen
the regional employment agencies, which link applicants and potential employers.

(b) The rural economy i s more productive. Since a viable agricultural sector i s key to a
dynamic off-farm economy, the indicator o f a more productive rural sector will be an increase
o f value-added per hectare from US$1,370 in 2003. On-going work towards this outcome
includes the FY98 Agricultural Reform Support Credit, the FY99 Title Registration Project,
the FY99 Irrigation D a m Safety, and the FY02 Irrigation Development project, as well as
studies on rural productivity and o n rural infrastructure. The FY04 Health and Education
projects are addressing the quality o f rural services, and the Trans Caucasus Tourism Initiative
i s helping promote the off-farm economy in select rural areas. Proposed new interventions
include the FY05 Rural Development Project, with a second rural operation in FY08. The
FY08 Project could include substantial support for irrigation andor for land titling work, and
its scope will be clarified in the CAS Progress Report. Advisory support to the telecoms
sector will help improve services in rural areas, and the FY07 Infrastructure Project i s likely to
improve key rural infrastructure, including roads.

(c) Social transfers are more effective. The effectiveness o f social transfers will be measured
by improvement in the satisfaction o f users with the social protection system from a baseline
to be determined. A prerequisite for improvements in this measure will be better tax
collection so that more funds are available for transfers, including the family poverty benefit.
The FY04 Social Protection Administration Project i s the primary tool to affect this result.
The proposed PRSCs and PRSC TA, as well as a WBI program to support pensions
administration will support these objectives, and analytical work in the Programmatic Public
Expenditure Reviews, the Country Economic Memorandum and Programmatic Poverty
Assessments will also help achieve the goal.

" In contrast, the average notional pension as a share o f average wages was 25% in Georgia, 32% in Azerbaijan and 37%
in Russia.

-16-

(d) Extreme consumption poverty falls. The goal i s for extreme consumption poverty to
decline from 17% in 2002. Many interventions in the on-going and future portfolios
contribute to this goal. Because i t i s not yet clear why economic growth has not led to deeper
reductions in poverty, analytical work to address this issue (the Labor Market Study, the C E M
o n pro-poor growth and the Programmatic Poverty Assessments) will be a major element o f
the CAS work program. Additional results and measures may be developed in the CAS
Progress Report in the light o f the conclusions o f those studies. The PRSCs and PRSC TA
will be major IDA vehicles for influencing these results, but many on-going and future
interventions will also contribute.

6.3 Goal Three: Reduce non-income poverty
41.
Long-term strategic goal. The PRSP and this CAS focus on the need to increase the wellbeing o f the poor by improving their access to affordable healthcare, education, drinking water,
sanitation and heating.
42.
Principal problems. Although essential reforms in healthcare, education and infrastructure
have begun, and basic services in some parts o f the country have improved significantly, they s t i l l do
not come close to meeting the needs o f a rapidly growing and modernizing economy.
(a) Poor quality education. The education system does not meet the country’s new needs.
Armenia’s public expenditures o n education are very l o w (among the lowest in the FSU), and
available resources are not used efficiently -- for example the school system has not adapted to
the decline in Armenia’s population since independence, resulting in an excessively high
teachedpupil ratio. Furthermore, the school curriculum i s not properly equipping children for
the labor market, since the curriculum has not yet been fully revised to meet the needs o f a
market economy. Facilities are inadequate and teachers are not properly skilled or motivated.

(b) Unaffordable health care. The healthcare system does not generally provide affordable

services, nor are they o f adequate quality. Public expenditures o n healthcare are l o w and
poorly targeted, with the excessively large hospital network absorbing more than h a l f o f
public health expenditures. As a consequence primary health care i s starved o f funds, with
unofficial side-payments large and frequent (half o f all households using healthcare services
report making unofficial payments). The need for such unofficial payments i s an important
reason that only 22% o f the poor report using the healthcare system when they are sick. Staff
are not properly skilled or motivated, school buildings have been inadequately maintained,
and much o f the equipment i s outdated.

(c) Lack of investment in infrastructure. The poor financial condition o f many o f the country’s
utilities has precluded adequate investment in infrastructure. Few people have 24-hour supply
o f drinking water, and even fewer have adequate wastewater services. An increasing number
o f water supply pipelines fail to comply with sanitary standards, leading to emerging
outbreaks o f water-borne diseases. Since 2002, Yerevan has seen improvements in water
availability and quality, but further improvements are required. Other parts o f Armenia have
seen almost n o progress. Performance o f the electricity utilities has improved substantially,
with collections rising and tariffs increasing. These higher tariffs may make i t difficult for
some o f the poorest consumers to afford these services. M a n y Armenians suffer during the

-17-

harsh winters, since it i s difficult for them to heat their houses adequately. People are forced
to use inefficient and expensive electricity, or wood, which i s scarce in Armenia. The poor
are particularly likely to burn wood, often in apartment buildings without proper stoves and
chimneys, which causes health problems. Transport i s a major constraint in rural areas,
leading to difficulties gaining access to agricultural and labor markets, as well as to health
facilities and schools, particularly in winter. Furthermore, problems with vehicle licensing
and road safety lead to unduly high numbers o f traffic deaths.
43.
Results achievable in CAS period. The C A S proposes to help overcome these constraints
through an integrated series o f interventions designed to achieve the following measurable results:
(a) M o r e children stay in the education system. This would b e measured by an increase in the
net secondary enrollment rate from 0.61.12 The F Y 0 4 Education Quality and Relevance
Credit i s the primary vehicle to influence this indicator in IDA’Scurrent portfolio. Activities
in the future, such as the PRSCs and PRSC TA will also contribute. The proposed Social
Investment Fund I11 will rehabilitate some school buildings, and the proposed urban heating
project will help modernize heating systems in selected schools. The programmatic Public
Expenditure Reviews (PERs) will identify relevant issues and propose solutions.

(b) M o r e of the population uses healthcare services. Better access to healthcare will be
measured by an increase in the share o f the sick w h o use healthcare services, from 22% for the
bottom consumption quintile, and from 26% in 2001 in the entire rural population. The FY04
Health System Modernization Project will contribute to improvements in this indicator backed
up by the proposed PRSCs and PRSC TA. Public health will also benefit from other proposed
interventions: the FY05 Yerevan Water and Sanitation Project, the F Y 0 6 Urban Heating
Project, and, if it improves transport in remote areas, the F Y 0 7 Infrastructure Project should
improve access to healthcare facilities. The programmatic PERs will identify issues and
propose solutions relating to healthcare spending.

(c) The population has better access to basic infrastructure. This will be measured by the
share o f the population connected to 24-hour piped water increasing from 22% in 2003, and
by the share o f households with gas-based heating systems increasing by 20% from a baseline
to b e determined. In the on-going portfolio, the F Y 9 8 Municipal Development and FY04
Armenia Water projects will contribute to improving drinking water services, and a PPIAF
grant i s supporting the multi-utility regulator. Proposed new interventions include the F Y 0 6
Urban Heating, the F Y 0 5 Yerevan Water and Wastewater, and the F Y 0 7 Infrastructure
P r 0 j e ~ t s . l ~A poverty and social impact assessment, associated with the PRSCs, will assess
the impacts o n the poor o f utility tariff increases, and suggest potential mitigation
mechanisms. In addition, IDA will work with the Government to seek co-financing for w o r k
o n road safety and vehicle licensing.

6.4 Resource Levels and Trbgers
44.
Since the early 1990s, Armenia has benefited from a high level o f international assistance.
Over the last five years, official donor assistance and remittances represented 11% o f GDP, with
bilateral donors accounting for about 60% o f this assistance. O f the remaining 40% o f aid provided
by multilateral donors, IDA provided about two-thirds, and the European U n i o n a fifth.14 Substantial
unofficial assistance has also been available, mainly from diaspora sources. One US-based
foundation has been particularly prominent, providing support averaging 6% o f GDP for the last three
years. 15

45.
I t i s not yet clear whether high levels o f donor assistance from existing sources will continue
over the CAS period. However, Armenia will have access to a new source o f investment finance -the Millennium Challenge Account -- being established by the U S Government. The CAS projections
assume that Armenia will continue to enjoy strong donor support, possibly declining as the country’s
per capita income increases, and that IDA will remain an important source o f assistance.

46.
Although i t i s currently not creditworthy for IBRD lending, Armenia could potentially become
so towards the end o f the CAS period. This would require good macroeconomic performance,
continued political stability, sustained progress in economic, fiscal and financial reform, improvements in the business and financial climate leading to steady private sector growth, and reduced
reliance on preferred creditors to satisfy financing needs. Armenia’s progress towards IBRD eligibili t y will be monitored over the CAS period, and an update, with specific creditworthiness benchmarks,
provided at the time o f the CAS Progress Report. Preparing the way for IBRD lending i s particularly
important given Armenia’s rapidly rising per capita income, which could lead to it being given blend
( o f IDA and IBRD) status in the next CAS period.
47.
Armenia became a High Case performer during the 2002-2004 CAS period, having achieved
the highest IDA performance coefficient in the E C A region. I t will enter the new CAS in a Base Case
scenario for IDA support, which assumes a continuation of the existing good performance and
provides IDA lending o f US$170 million. I f Armenia makes further improvements in public sector
management (see triggers in Table 9) i t will move into the High Case, which will support accelerated
reforms o f the public sector through an additional Public Sector Modernization Credit, additional
PRSC resources, and additional funding for rural development and infrastructure. IDA resources o f
about US$220 million will become available in the High Case. In the unexpected event o f
deteriorating performance, a L o w Case scenario would reduce IDA lending to about US$90 million.
This will involve halting new PRSC lending, and restricting new investment operations to those that
directly protect the most vulnerable.

48.
The triggers for moving to the High Case are based mainly o n the Government’s ambitious
targets for social sector spending and tax collections, and improvement in the performance o f public
sector agencies.

Follow-on interventions to continue the reforms supported by the F Y 0 4 Health and Education
xogrammatic credits are expected soon after the close o f this CAS period. If, however, implementa:ion o f the reforms proceeds faster than expected, and the appropriate institutional and policy changes
.ire made, i t may be possible to accelerate processing o f these follow-on activities

50.
o n the results o f the overall program, it will be necessary to review progress towards those results at
the mid-point o f CAS implementation. This review will allow a stocktaking o f Armenia’s progress
towards the intermediate and CAS outcomes, and refinement o f those outcomes and quantitative
goals. I t will also allow reformulation o f goals in light o f changing circumstances and new
information. The Progress Report will be coordinated closely with the government’s PRSP
monitoring process as well as w i t h IDA’Sportfolio review.

52.
A carefully sequenced program o f Analytical and Advisory Work (AAA) will provide the
underpinnings for lending and dialogue with the Government and civil society. The program includes
three types o f products:

-21-

Freestanding studies, such as those o n rural productivity and labor markets, and the Country
Economic Memorandum on pro-poor growth.
0

0

Programmatic analytical work, especially the Poverty Assessments and the Public Expenditure
Reviews. Programmatic AAA will rest o n a joint work-program involving IDA, Government
and other donors, and be undertaken continuously to produce a series o f joint, related products
rather than one discrete report. This i s a new form o f partnership, which will be employed
during this CAS period, with the goal o f encouraging a steady building o f consensus over the
A A A ’ s conclusions, promoting broad ownership o f the recommendations and strengthening
analytical capacity in government agencies.
Advisory work, such as a series o f discussion notes on improving the institutional, legal and
bureaucratic environment for the private and financial sectors. Further support for the
Business Survey would allow continued monitoring o f progress in improving the environment
for the private sector.

6.6 Specific Issues
6.6.1 The PRSCs
53.
The program includes a sequence o f three to four Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs)
for FY05, 06 and 07 (and a fourth in FY08 in the High Case). These will support the PRSP
objectives, and link closely w i t h the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facilities. The PRSCs are
likely to have three areas o f focus, w i t h indicative content as follows:
0

Improving the environment for private sector growth:
-

Governance, including anti-corruption policies and their implementation; making
licensing, permitting and certification procedures more transparent; empowering citizens
to be active in making institutions accountable; improvements in the judiciary system; and
strengthening government capacity to enforce environmental protection legislation.

-

Financial sector reforms, including payment system infrastructure; development o f the
insurance sector; improving corporate governance o f banks; improving court proceedings
for debt recovery; enforcement o f bankruptcy legislation; and possibly development of a
housing finance market.

- Standards, metrology and consumer protection as well as improving legislation and
enforcement o f intellectual property rights.
0

Improving public sector financial management:
-

Tax collection, including an annual increase in tax collection o f 0.4 percentage points o f
GDP during the CAS period, to be achieved in part through much improved administration
o f VAT, personal income and payroll taxes, and, most importantly, customs.

- Greater budget accountability including increased transparency o f the budgeting process at
central and local levels; line ministry accountability for budget outcomes; increased use o f

-22-

internal and external audits; and a consolidated system o f financial reporting by state
enterprises, including public sector entities in education and health.

- More strategic approach to budgeting, including introduction o f stronger l i n k s between the
annual budgets, the MTEF and the PRSP.
Addressing priority social sector issues:

- A steady increase in expenditure and/or efficiency o f spending o n education, health and
social security following targets set in the PRSP.

6.6.2 Cross-cutt ing themes
The CAS will place major emphasis on learning and capacity building. Given Armenia’s
54.
good track record making effective use o f IDA resources, this CAS puts significant emphasis o n
programmatic work, conducted collaboratively between IDA, Government and other donors
continuously over the course o f CAS implementation. Complementing IDA’Splanned activities, the
World Bank Institute (WBI) has developed a comprehensive work plan for additional capacity
enhancement support (see paragraph 64 and Annex 3). The Institute will work w i t h local partners and
NGOs to leverage their local knowledge and improve cost-effectiveness.
55.
Armenia’s capacity for poverty monitoring and analysis i s reasonably good, as the National
Statistical Service (NSS) has conducted regular household surveys for a number o f years.
Improvements could be made in a number o f areas: (i)
strengthening the linkages between different
household surveys; (ii)
improving the measure o f household welfare by adjusting for regional prices
and economies o f scale within households; (iii)
updating questionnaires to reflect current policies
(e.g. on social assistance) and provide better information (e.g. on employment and earnings); (iv)
developing poverty maps as a policy tool; and (v) improving monitoring o f non-income dimensions
o f poverty, particularly health, education and labor markets. The PRSP follow-up process i s helping
the Government improve i t s capacity for monitoring and evaluation o f development results, and
helping the Statistical Service better tailor its data for the needs o f policy evaluation. UNDP, in coordination with IDA, has a program to further develop that capacity.
56.
Gender i s integrated into many areas o f the work program. The Programmatic Poverty
Assessments will disaggregate all relevant data by gender. One o f the most important gender issues
in Armenia i s maternal health, since the country has relatively high rates o f maternal mortality and
abortion; the FY04 Health project addresses both o f these problems directly. Some issues, such as
why so many boys drop out o f secondary school, will be addressed under the FY04 Education
Project. The proposed Labor Market Study will pay particular attention to differences in how men
and women fare in the labor market, and the business survey may include a module to address the
specific issues faced by women entrepreneurs.

57.
Environmental issues are also well mainstreamed in the program. In addition to on-going
work on natural resource management, and a proposed Country Environmental Assessment, many
interventions will improve environmental conditions. The Renewable Energy Project aims to reduce
Armenia’s dependence o n imported fossil fuels, and plans to leverage grant funding from GEF, the
Prototype Carbon Fund and related instruments, as well as possibly from the EBRD, USAID and
others. Other instruments likely to have a positive environmental impact include: the Urban Heating

-23 -

project, which should reduce demand for fuelwood for heating; the Rural Development Project, which
will assess the options for sustainable forestry, natural resource based income generation activities
and for reducing Armenia’s vulnerability to many natural disasters. The water supply and sanitation
projects, together with any additional investment in irrigation (through the FY08 Rural Development
I1 or FY07 Infrastructure projects) will improve water resource management in line with guidance
provided by the Water Resource Plan prepared during the last CAS period.

58.
Labor Standards. Armenia has a good record o n core labor standards, including: (i)
elimination o f all forms o f forced or compulsory labor; (ii)
effective abolition o f formal use o f child
labor; (iii)
equal opportunity and non-discrimination in employment; and (iv) freedom o f association
and the right to collective bargaining. Laws regulating trade unions and collective bargaining have
substantially met the core labor standard goals, and the Confederation o f Trade Unions o f Armenia
has negotiated agreements o n job security, salaries, pensions, and social assistance. Binding contracts
between workers (with representation from grass-roots union organizations) and employers are
common in large enterprises, but have not yet taken firm root in smaller enterprises. The Government
o f Armenia does not yet comply with the minimum standards for the elimination o f trafficking in
persons, but in 2003 i t acknowledged the need for increased action, and focused more law
enforcement resources o n the problem.

6.6.3 Sequencing
59.
The CAS Completion Report (Annex 2) and OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation
(SecM2004-0090) both emphasize that appropriate sequencing between analytical work and
investment/adjustment operations was an important factor in achieving successful outcomes. This
CAS endeavors to continue that careful sequencing as follows:
0

0

0

0

The programmatic poverty assessments and PERs, the CEM, advisory work o n the financial
and private sectors, and the business environment surveys will feed into the PRSCs. Grants
from the Institutional Development Fund to support procurement and financial accountability
link to related analytical work to form the basis for PRSC measures in those areas. The labor
market study and C E M o n pro-poor growth will provide analytical input into PRSC initiatives
to help make growth more pro-poor. The Country Environmental Assessment will complement PRSC work on enforcement o f environmental legislation.
E S W o n rural productivity and on rural infrastructure are being undertaken ahead o f design o f
the FY05 Rural Development Project, so that the operation can build o n a sound analytical
footing, and benefit from strong government ownership o f the measures to be supported. The
Rural Development Project will also benefit from practical lessons from the agricultural, land
cadastre, irrigation and natural resource management projects currently underway.
The public sector project (High Case) will build o n experience o f several projects currently
under implementation, IDF grants relating to public procurement, and WBI capacity building
efforts.
The IDF to strengthen the multi-utility regulator will feed into PRSC work o n telecoms, the
ongoing and future investment projects for drinking water as well as the planned FY07
Renewable Energy and Infrastructure Projects.

6 . 7 Other World Bank Group Support
60.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC). IFC’s held portfolio in Armenia as o f April
1, 2004 amounted to US$7.09 million. IFC made its first investment in Armenia in March 2001, a
US$3.57 million quasi-equity investment for the renovation o f Hotel Armenia, and in August 2003,
participated in a capital increase by investing an additional US$1.25 million.
61.
IFC’s strategy in Armenia focuses o n the development o f small and medium sized enterprises
(SMEs). In FY03, the Corporation supported the development o f the first privately-owned leasing
company in Armenia by providing US$2.27 million in loan and equity finance to A C B A Leasing. It
has also approved the SME Risk Capital Fund (US$5 million in equity and quasi-equity), which i s
pending commitment. IFC’s f i r s t investment in an Armenian bank, Armeconombank, i s pending
circulation to the Board. I t involves a $2 million loan for on-lending to SMEs and for residential
mortgages, and includes an option to purchase equity.
62.
The Corporation continues to actively explore further opportunities. I t will continue to focus
i t s efforts on financial intermediaries that can reach SMEs through a combination o f investment and
tailored advisory work. In line w i t h the World Bank Group’s strategy for the financial sector, I F C
will consider support to development o f housing finance and possibly insurance markets. IFC will
continue to seek opportunities for small direct investments in export-oriented enterprises and highimpact projects in sectors where Armenia may have a comparative advantage, including the
manufacturing, agribusiness, technology and mining sectors.
63.
Armenia has been a member o f the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
since 1995. Over that period, MIGA guarantees have facilitated approximately US$3.0 million o f
FDI into Armenia, through a project in the financial services sector. In 2000, a $2.7 m i l l i o n guarantee
was issued to the Commercial Bank o f Greece for i t s equity investment in the establishment o f a
subsidiary branch, International Commercial Black Sea Bank (Armenia) S.A., which will operate as a
wholesale bank, focusing i t s activities in the areas o f project finance, trade finance, advisory work
and privatization o f local companies. MIGA has also played a central role with the World Bank in
implementing a loan, which finances a $1 million capacity-building program for the Government’s
FDI and trade arm -- the Armenian Development Agency (ADA). In addition to direct support, MIGA
also provides online information services that connect investors to current information o n investment
opportunities, business operating conditions, potential partners, and other resources, which currently
contain over 90 documents relating to Armenia. Over this CAS period, MIGA will continue to
respond to market demand in Armenia.
64.
The World Bank Institute (WBI) has developed a detailed program to support CAS
objectives (see Annex 3). WBI will build knowledge and capacity relating to fiscal decentralization,
pension reform, utilities regulation, anti-corruption and training o f c i v i l servants. I t will also facilitate
Armenian delegates participating periodically in regional initiatives that cover decentralization,
pension reforms and PRSP implementation.
65.
Other services related to the World Bank Group are also active in Armenia, providing support
relating to private sector development. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) i s a joint
service o f the I F C and the World Bank. I t has supported annual administrative and regulatory cost

-25-

surveys, as well as provided expert review o f key legislation. I t i s working with the Government to
build its capacity to conduct such studies in the future. In the future, FIAS i s planning to continue
this support in the areas o f administrative barriers to investment and competition policy. The PublicPrivate Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) i s a multi-donor technical assistance facility that
aims to promote best practices o n issues related to private sector involvement in infrastructure in
developing countries. I t plans to continue its current support for support for the multi-sector regulator
and for development o f telecommunications services in rural areas.

66.
Armenia i s also eligible for support under two funds established by the World Bank that
provide grant finance to help reduce global carbon emissions: the Community Development Carbon
Fund and the BioCarbon Fund. The first finances small-scale projects that benefit local
communities as they abate carbon emissions, while the second finances eligible afforestation and
reforestation projects. The FY07 Renewable Energy Project has already been identified as having
potential for carbon fund financing.
Other opportunities will be explored during CAS
implementation, particularly relating to sustainable forestry, land management, transport and waste
management.

6.8 Partnersh@s
67.
A large number o f donors have extensive programs in Armenia, requiring active management
and coordination. The Government’s role in managing and coordinating donors has weakened since
the late 1990s, when the office in the Ministry o f Finance and Economy designated to monitor donor
activities began to play a less central role in the process. Since preparation and implementation o f the
PRSP, however, the Government has resumed a more active role. The PRSP process has helped
clarify the Government’s priorities, and the Ministry o f Finance and Economy i s increasingly using i t
to attract financing for priority investments and activities. UNDP and IDA are helping strengthen this
function. In the last few years, independently o f the Government, donors have been meeting
regularly to share information, coordinate plans and programs, and reduce duplication. Fourteen
sector-specific Partner Groups have been established for this purpose, and an umbrella Donor
Coordination Group meets on a monthly basis in Yerevan. These meetings will continue over the
next few years, but will increasingly take their lead from the Government. Annex 4 o n partnerships
summarizes donor programs.
68.
UNDP supports a broad range o f activities in Armenia, and works closely w i t h IDA on many
o f its programs. I t has a major program helping the Government develop systems to monitor
development results. Another key area o f focus i s improving delivery o f public services at central
and local levels, including governance, judicial reform, local government strengthening and
improvement o f social protection administration. UNDP also promotes support infrastructure for
small and medium sized enterprises. In rural areas, i t has a program to promote agro-based
employment opportunities and agricultural services, as w e l l as helping protect Armenia’s
biodiversity. UNDP programs help rehabilitate community infrastructure, build capacity for
monitoring quality o f drinking water, and improve energy efficiency. In the area o f healthcare,
UNDP concentrates o n improving access to H I V / A I D s prevention and treatment, and on helping
communities and healthcare professionals get involved in the policy-making process.

-26-

69.
EBRD concentrates on private sector development through a l i n e o f credit for SMEs, a
Business Advisory Program, and trade facilitation. I t may cooperate with IDA and GEF o n the FY07
Renewable Energy Project.

70.
UNICEF has important programs dealing w i t h several aspects o f child welfare. I t i s helping
the Government develop effective mechanisms for registering births and infant deaths. I t has
programs to improve administration o f juvenile justice; to establish local organizations responsible
for child protection; to help youths who have been in orphanages and similar institutions integrate
into society; and to promote policies relating to children and families at risk. In the education sector,
U N I C E F i s helping build capacity, improve learning materials, and make education more inclusive
(including special education). For healthcare, UNICEF i s providing basic supplies to health posts, as
well as promoting early intervention and early identification o f childhood disability.
7 1.
USAID has a large program that focuses primarily o n public sector management and private
sector development. To improve central Government functions, USAID has a major program to
improve tax and customs administration, and i s also helping to: strengthen the Armenian bar and
judiciary; improve public sector accounting; improve the transparency o f national accounts, and
strengthen the payment and accounting systems for healthcare. I t also supports activities at the local
government level, particularly to make local authorities more accessible to their citizens. U SAID has
a major program to improve social assistance and social insurance. In healthcare, U S A I D i s working
to refocus health services on family medicine and reproductive health, as w e l l as providing equipment
and pharmaceutical supply. U SAID has a community works program to rehabilitate community
infrastructure and a school heating program, and i s promoting environmental protection in Armenia
through a program to improve energy efficiency, helping develop renewable energy and supporting
water resources management. U S A I D i s helping Armenia’s private sector development improving
access to finance and improving the capacity o f medium sized enterprises and i s currently designing a
program o f additional support to private enterprise. The U S Department o f Agriculture i s also
active in rural Armenia, supporting extension and outreach to farmers, micro credit, support for agroprocessing. In each o f these areas, IDA i s coordinating closely with USAID and USDA.
72.
The European Union (EU) has a broad range o f activities in Armenia. I t provides financial
assistance for macro-economic management, as well as technical assistance to improve public
administration, particularly tax and customs administration, and has detailed programs to help
improve local government in two marzes (counties). The EU has a private sector development
program. I t also plays a major role in rural development through a food security program, and
support to the Ministry o f Agriculture and the State Cadastre. Vocational education and training i s an
important area o f EU focus, as i s promoting use o f technology in education. To improve environmental conditions, the EU i s helping to: develop hydropower; improve management o f municipal
solid waste; disseminate environmental information; and establish regional environmental centers.
DFID focuses on major programs o n public sector reform and o n integrated regional
73.
development in two marzes. I t has supported both the PRSP and M T E F process, including through
initiatives to develop marz level poverty reduction strategies in the two poorest marzes.

74.
GTZ concentrates on development o f local governments and on promoting SMEs, including
through credit lines. I t also has training and education programs for vocational education, improving
agricultural knowledge and training bankers. To protect the environment, GTZ i s helping the

-27-

Government establish a protected area. K f W is, amongst other things, helping develop a local water
and wastewater company, which currently operates in twelve cities and villages and serves more than
100,000 people. KfW i s now beginning similar projects in other parts o f the country.

75.
UNHCR i s helping the Government develop legislation adequate for the needs o f refugees.
This includes training the judiciary in international refugee law, systems for asylum and for acquiring
citizenship. I t i s also supporting social service, education and health measures that benefit refugees.
IFAD has a program to promote on- and off-farm economic activity in rural areas, and the World
Food Programme has several food-for-work and food-for-training activities, mostly in rural and
vulnerable areas. I t also has a school feeding program. F A 0 i s helping the Government develop a
national agricultural strategy and providing technical assistance to build capacity in the Ministry o f
Agriculture and related organizations. I t provides assistance to farmers afflicted by natural disasters,
and also has a mountain areas program to help develop some o f the poorest and most isolated areas o f
the country. In addition, UNAIDS and the Global Fund are working to prevent the spread o f
H I V / A I D S in Armenia.
76.
The Netherlands has cofinanced the Structural Adjustment Credits, adding significantly to
their impact through support totaling U S 4 4 m i l l i o n to date. The Netherlands has assisted with the
PRSP process through Trust Fund financing executed by the World Bank. The Netherlands has also
worked with I F C to support corporate governance reform, providing training to 80 percent o f
Armenia’s active corporations.

77.

Japan has co-financed with IDA the Electricity Transmission and Distribution Project
through a credit from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (now part o f the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation). Japan has also supported, through grants from the Ministry o f Foreign
Affairs, road maintenance and cultural preservation. The Japan-funded, World Bank-executed, Policy
and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) grant program has provided support for structural
adjustment, rural development and utility restructuring.

6.9 Risks of the strategy
The situation in and around Armenia could change in a number o f ways that would affect
78.
development in the country both for better and for worse.

i. Political change in the Caucasus region. Both positive and negative developments

in the

region are possible over the CAS period. IDA’SFY05 Country Economic Memorandum will
analyze how Armenia can best prepare i t s e l f for possible improvements, including
investments that would allow the economy to reap the fullest benefits from developments such
as a normalization o f trade relations. Although i t i s not considered likely at this time, renewed
instability in the Caucasus i s possible, and i t would make implementation o f much o f the
proposed strategy difficult. In this event, significant adjustments in the work program would
be unavoidable, and the Executive Directors would be consulted o n a revised strategy.

ii. Political consensus in Armenia. Armenia’s very impressive reform track record has
depended on strong political consensus, both within and between the executive and legislative
branches. As discussed earlier, the domestic political context i s becoming more complicated,
and this could affect reform momentum by reducing public, investor and/or donor confidence.

-28-

A deceleration in improvements in tax revenues and/or slower economic growth could
increase the financing gap to the extent that expected levels o f IDA adjustment lending and
donor funding could not cover it. The CAS program aims to mitigate this risk by outreach and

knowledge activities, and encouraging active participation and dialogue w i t h Government and
civil society around the PRSP process generally, and on a range o f specific reform priorities,
including health and education revitalization, local government development, strengthening o f
governance and anti-corruption efforts, and improvements in social protection arrangements.

iii. Exogenous economic shocks. Any decline in global demand would likely hamper Armenia’s
export growth and reduce workers’ remittances and perhaps diaspora assistance. An o i l price

shock would also affect the Armenian economy - every $5 increase in the price o f a barrel o f
o i l increases Armenia’s import bill by the equivalent o f 1 percent o f GDP. If exogenous
shocks cause a major shift in Armenia’s economic situation, IDA would revisit the
prioritization o f its lending and AAA and amend the portfolio as necessary.

iv. Unexpected natural resource shock, such as an earthquake, major drought, flood, landslide,
or frost. IDA i s helping the Government reduce Armenia’s vulnerability to natural disasters

through the various ongoing and planned rural and natural resource management
interventions, by ensuring that major construction financed by the Bank complies w i t h
earthquake-compatible building codes, and through a dam safety program that reinforces the
country’s important barrages.

Introduction

Executive Summary

In 2001, IDA’Sboard approved a country assistance strategy (CAS) for Armenia for the
period FY2002-2004. This completion report evaluates progress implementing that CAS.

CAS Objectives
The 2001 CAS had three broad objectives: (i)
creating jobs through private sector
development; (ii)
improving governance and public sector services; and (iii)
rebuilding
human capital. These objectives complemented the goals o f the Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, which was published shortly before the CAS.

Country Outcomes
Armenia has made substantial progress over the CAS period. The economy grew by 13%
in 2002 and 14% in 2003, with increasingly diverse sources o f growth. Manufacturing
exports grew by 50% over the period and Armenia increased exports to counties outside
the CIS. According to surveys, the business environment - registration, licensing,
inspections, customs clearances, tax requirements and corruption - have improved since
2000. The number o f f i r m s increased by 15% between 2001 and 2003 and small and
medium enterprise growth was about 7% per year during the CAS period. However,
formal sector employment has not grown at the same rate as output. This i s because
redundancies from state owned enterprises have continued, and because many f i r m s
appear to have expanded by using surplus capital rather than hiring new employees.
Armenia has seen some progress in reducing poverty, which fell from 55% in 1998/99 to
48% in 2001. Between 2001 and 2002, however, overall poverty increased slightly
(poverty in Yerevan continued to fall, rural poverty remained stagnant and poverty in
other urban areas increased). The increase in poverty in other urban areas i s puzzling.
The stagnant poverty situation in rural areas appears to b e the result o f worsening
domestic agricultural terms o f trade, with resulting declines in returns to labor in some
rural areas, since the agricultural labor force remains high. Subsistence farming still
dominates, despite some commercial successes in agriculture, particularly in the fertile
Ararat valley.
Over the CAS period, public sector services and governance both improved, although
further progress i s s t i l l necessary. The Government completed the first stage o f c i v i l
service reform and prepared and began implementing an anti-corruption strategy. The
average pension increased by 30%, and pension arrears were cleared. Targeting o f social
protection schemes has improved and leakage i s low. The quasi-fiscal deficit associated
with the power sector (equivalent to 2% o f GDP) was eliminated and most o f the country
now has uninterrupted power supply. By 2003, nearly h a l f o f the population o f Yerevan
(close to one fifth o f the country’s population) had at least 12 hours supply o f good
quality water compared to only 10% in 2001. By March 2004, h a l f o f the city’s
population had service 24 hours per day.

-39-

Human capital has improved. Health outcomes are better, although the improvement was
not as great the 2001 CAS had targeted. Differences between outcomes in urban and
rural areas are marked. People are not using health services, at least in part because
formal and informal payments can be unaffordably high. Social protection mechanisms
introduced in 1999, however, do appear to be helping the poor access healthcare to some
extent. Participation in basic education remains high, but children, especially boys, are
dropping out o f secondary school. This i s a particular problem in rural areas and for
poorer children. The Government i s working to improve the quality o f education. Public
expenditure on both health and education has increased but remains l o w in both sectors.

I D A S contribution to country outcomes
The 2001 CAS set a series o f outcome targets, all o f which have either been met or have
seen substantial progress. In many cases, IDA interventions, often in a mutually
supportive package of analytical work, investment and policy-based lending, made direct
contributions towards the country results discussed above. Measuring the precise
contribution o f IDA activities to those outcomes i s difficult, however, because the CAS
did not explain the mechanisms, and some indicators did not fit the interventions.

Evaluation o f CAS performance
IDA’s performance was satisfactory. The focus o f the CAS, the m i x and design o f
interventions were all appropriate. The quality o f IDA’s work appears to have been
good, judging from internal reporting systems as well as OED and Q A G reports. M a n y
o f the products were not delivered at the time planned. In some cases this was a
deliberate decision in response to changing circumstances, but in other cases, delays
resulted from key staff members not being available at the right time.

Lessons for future CAS design
The areas o f focus and the m i x o f interventions were appropriate and should be
continued. Future work should perhaps put more effort into ensuring that growth
leads to as much employment and poverty reduction as possible.
Outcome indicators should be linked more clearly to IDA interventions and should be
used as a management tool throughout CAS implementation.
Devolving responsibility for portfolio management to the country manager helped
improve portfolio quality and should be continued.
A strong multi-sectoral team w i t h some task management responsibilities in the
country office was important for achieving results and future work should be
designed to benefit from this team as much as possible.
During implementation o f future CASs, management needs to pay particular attention
to ensuring availability o f key staff at the appropriate time.
Consultations on the next CAS can benefit from recent discussions concerning the
PRSP, allowing the CAS discussions to concentrate o n how IDA can best help the
Government implement its poverty reduction priorities.

Completion Report for IDA’S Country Assistance
Strategy for Armenia FYO2-04
1. Introduction
This document reviews the experience implementing the International Development
Association (1DA)’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved in April 25,2001,
(Report No. 221 11-AM). The CAS covered financial years 2002-2004.

2. Armenia’s Objectives
The CAS intended to support the following objectives stated in Armenia’s Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (March 2001, report No. 2213 1):
0

0

Sustainable and equitable economic growth driven by a more dynamic private
sector. The public actions proposed involved reducing administrative barriers to
investment and entry, building effective public-private consultative mechanisms
and creating a level playing field for new and existing companies.
Public administration reform and an anti-corruption program. Public actions
included streamlining the c i v i l service and k e y regulatory agencies, advancing
judicial reform and improving domestic revenue collection.
Enhanced human development, Public actions included additional financing for
school education, basic health and infrastructure maintenance (assuming
improved utility revenues and savings from reduced subsidies to utilities), and
improved targeting o f social protection and education expenditures.

Neither the CAS nor the I-PRSP made an explicit link to the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), but the objectives overlapped w i t h MDG targets. The interventions to
promote the private sector, to improve public administration, and to reduce corruption
were intended to reduce extreme poverty, as were the proposed interventions to improve
social protection. Interventions to promote human development clearly help Armenia
meet the goals relating to health and education. The CAS’S proposed investments in
natural resource management, water supply and urban heating would all help Armenia
meet the MDG relating to environmental sustainability. Armenia has already met Goal 3
o n gender equality.
Armenia’s current status against the MDG targets and the World Bank’s evaluation o f the
likelihood o f the country meeting the goals are listed in Table 7 o f the FY05-08 Country
Assistance Strategy.

-41-

3. CAS Objectives
The CAS aimed to help Armenia achieve results in the following areas:
0

Private sector development, through:
o Improving the entrepreneurial climate by reducing regulatory and
administrative barriers to starting new and expanding existing businesses;
improving the tax and customs administration; improving land markets; and
strengthening the mechanisms for privatization and bankruptcy.
o Promoting the private sector by improving local managerial capacity.
o Direct support for foreign investment, by guarantees and advice as well as I F C
investments.
Improved governance and public sector services, through:
o Strengthening public administration by increasing the capacity for executive
decision-making in Government; streamlining and modemizing the c i v i l
service; making the civil service more accountable; improving public
expenditure management; reforming intergovernmental finance; improving
audit functions; and continuing reforms o f the judicial system.
o Improving the performance o f utilities by creating a single public services
regulatory body; shifting management o f water companies to private
operators; securing private financing for new investments in the power sector;
and promoting gas rather than electricity as the primary source o f heating.
o Improving rural services by increasing cost-recovery in irrigation; improving
property rights and land markets; and promoting small credit associations.
o Improving natural resource management by helping communities manage
their watersheds; promoting environmentally sustainable farming practices;
and improving managements o f forests and protected areas.

0

Rebuilding human capital, through:
o Education by improving financing for primary and secondary education,
increasing supplies o f textbooks; getting communities involved in schools;
improving the quality o f teaching; making school budgets more transparent;
improving the access o f the poor to schools; and improving the quality o f
education.
o Health by improving access to health services especially for the poor;
improving health financing to give greater priority to primary healthcare;
rationalizing the healthcare system; and helping the Government develop
H I V / A I D S strategy.
o Social Protection by helping reform the public pension system; promoting
better administration and targeting o f the family benefit; developing the
overall framework for social protection; and promoting policy reforms to
create more flexible labor markets.

-42-

4. Armenia’s progress towards i t s goals
The country made substantial progress towards these results, based o n the following:
Armenia ’s economy grew strongly, driven by the private sector. Real GDP grew
by 10% in 2001, 13% in 2002 and 15% in the first nine months o f 2003, and the
basis o f the economy has begun to diversify. More than 70% o f GDP was
generated by the private sector. Manufacturing exports grew by more than 50% in
two years, and Armenia has expanded i t s export markets beyond those o f the CIS.
The business climate has improved: firms’ overall confidence in the government
and in the business environment improved from an average o f 2.6 in 2000 to 3.3
in 2001 (on a 6 point scale, where 1 = total lack o f confidence). Businesses report
improvements in business registration, licensing, inspections and the tax system.
New firm growth was good: the stock o f f i r m s grew by 15% between 2001 and
2003, and small and medium enterprise growth was approximately 7% p.a. over
the same period. Formal sector employment did not match growth in output.
Aggregate employment remains lower than i t was in 1990 although i t did increase
in 2002 and 2003. There are two reasons for this. First, the massive j o b shedding
from state owned enterprises has continued to the present day. Second, business
surveys indicate that new f i r m s initially had surplus capacity because investments
needed to be o f a minimum economic scale. As domestic and export demand
increased, companies used that surplus capacity and then they plus additional new
entrants began to increase the demand for labor.
Armenia has made someprogress in reducingpoverty. Poverty f e l l from 55% in
1998/99 to 48% in 2001, with the sharpest drop seen in Yerevan. Preliminary
data indicate that between 2001 and 2002, this progress may have halted, as the
overall poverty incidence appears to have increased slightly. Over the latter
period, poverty appears to have continued falling in Yerevan, to have remained
stagnant in rural areas but to have increased in other urban areas. The 2002
results may be affected by government policies that caused the poverty family
benefit to fall considerably in 2002 (the number o f beneficiaries fell by 11% and
the average level o f benefit by 15%). These policies were reversed in 2003 with
expenditure returning to 2001 levels.
Governance has improved. Between 2000 and 2002, Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) indicate that Armenia has seen
improvements in political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality,
r u l e o f law, and control o f corruption. However, the country’s ratings for voice
and accountability f e l l over the same period. On all measures except political
stability, Armenia performs better than the average for the CIS. Transparency
International’s Corruption Perceptions Index rates Armenia as 78th o f 133
countries surveyed, the highest ranking in the F S U apart from the Baltic countries
and Belarus. Freedom House rated Armenia at 4/7 for political rights in 2000, up
from 3/7 in 1998, and rated Armenia at 4/7 in both years for civil liberties. Annual
business surveys similar to BEEPS also indicate improvements in governance.
For example, the share o f f i r m s reporting making bribes frequently declined from

-43-

40% in 1999 to 14% in 2002, and the average bribe as a share o f revenue declined
from 4.2% to 1% over the same period.
Civil service reform has begun. The Government passed a civil service law and
similar laws for the diplomatic, tax, customs and police services. I t established a
C i v i l Service Council to oversee management in line agencies. In addition, a law
o n remuneration o f civil servants was passed in July 2002, which requires, among
other things, that all senior c i v i l servants publicly declare their assets. W i t h
assistance from DFID, the Government has reviewed all central executive bodies
and has reorganized and written charters for most ministries. I t has also moved
many agencies from direct central control to l i n e ministries, to clarify
accountability and strengthen oversight. The first phase o f reform i s thus
complete, but substantial work remains to bring about changes in the actual
functioning o f government institutions.
Energy and water services have improved considerably. Water services have
improved considerably, but the improvements have all been in Yerevan (which
accounts for almost 40% o f the country’s population). By mid 2003,39% o f the
population had 24 hours supply and an additional 7% had it for at least 12 hours
per day. This compares to only 10% o f Yerevan’s population that had 12-hour
supply in 2001. The utility i s working more efficiently; 80 percent o f the
households have meters, and collections have risen from 33% o f billed water in
the period May-July 2002 to 84% in the same period in 2003. l6
Drinkingwater
quality i s good; 98% o f the water supply in Yerevan meets quality standards, but
the deteriorating infrastructure i s beginning to compromise these standards. In the
power sector, the whole country has benefited from major improvements. Almost
the entire population now has uninterrupted electricity supply. Tariff collection
has increased from 80% in 2001 to 98% in 2003. The quasi-fiscal deficit
associated with the electricity sector (2% o f GDP in 2001) has been effectively
eliminated since the distribution company was privatized in November 2002. The
Energy Regulatory Commission has been transformed to a multi-utility regulator,
although the agency needs to develop additional capacity. The Government
adopted an Urban Heating Strategy in September 2002; i t has removed some o f
the barriers to sustainable heating services, and i s now piloting efficient and less
polluting approaches to heating large apartment buildings. As a result o f increased
electricity prices and improved collection rates, 50,000 households switched to
gas for heating, which i s more efficient and less polluting.
The county ’s social protection system has improved. The Government has
cleared its arrears, and the average pension increased by 30% between 2001 and
2003. Surveys indicate that targeting o f the social protection schemes has
improved and that leakage i s low, although further improvements are s t i l l
necessary. The Government has set up a personal identification system for all the
Armenians (more than 250,000 people n o w have PIN numbers) for automating
the social insurance, social welfare offices and employment services. Almost all
people in formal employment now make their social insurance contributions, w i t h
16

the number increasing by 100,000 between 2001 and 2003. The Government has
begun to modernize the pension administration system, setting up a management
information system with individual records for those covered by social insurance
(contributors to the system) and their employers, as well as computerized records
for current pensioners. They are expected to complete this modernization in 2006.
However, the pension administration needs additional human resources capacity
and improved accounting and administrative systems. To address labor market
problems, the Government has prepared Draft Labor Code and developed a new
system for training the unemployed to better match the labor supply and demand.

Human capital has improved. According to administrative data, between 200 1
and 2003, maternal mortality f e l l from 47 per 100,000 lives births to 34. Other
sources give higher figures, but also show positive trends. Under five mortality
f e l l from 25 per 1,000 live births to 16 over the same period. These figures mask a
significant difference between rural and urban areas. According to survey data
(ADHS 2000), rural infant and early childhood mortality rates exceeded urban
rates by 47 percent and 22 percent, respectively, during the 1990s. The healthcare
system has improved as the Government has increased the share o f spending
allocated to primary healthcare and established a system o f family doctors.
Substantial problems remain, however. Official and unofficial payments are high
and because there i s no insurance mechanism, these costs often deter people from
using services. The poverty family benefit does appear to have helped some
people use healthcare services, but o n the whole use rates are low. The country
still has excess hospital capacity and public spending o n the sector remains low.
Participation in basic education i s high, w i t h a net enrollment rate o f 94% in 2001,
spread fairly evenly across quintiles. Secondary education, however, i s more
problematic. Surveys indicate that the net enrollment rate in secondary education
i s 61%, and i s lower for the poor (52% for the poorest quintile versus 64% for the
richest). Public spending o n education increased by 45% between 1997 and 2001
but remains low. IDA helped ensure that high quality textbooks are available to
all at a reasonable cost, helped create some managerial and financial autonomy in
40% o f all schools and encouraged greater parent involvement in schools. I t also
helped begin consolidation o f underutilized schools.
Rural areas have not grown as much as urban areas. Poverty rates in rural areas
stagnated between 1998/99 and 2001, while they dropped considerably in urban
areas. There are few off-farm opportunities and subsistence farming s t i l l
dominates (only 29% o f farming households had commercial surpluses in 2001)
indicating that agriculture i s s t i l l a basic safety net for many families. Domestic
agricultural terms o f trade worsened every year between 1997 and 2002 and
agriculture’s share o f GDP declined consistently over the same period. Since the
size o f the agricultural workforce remained constant, returns to labor in some
rural areas may have declined. While o n average rural areas have stagnated, some
sectors, particularly those located in the fertile Ararat valley, have seen some
progress. Agricultural exports increased from $220mn in 1998 to $354 million in
2001. Since 1999, agricultural exports have grown as a share o f exports,
representing 14% in 200 1. Land titling i s almost complete (the Government plans

-45-

to complete i t in 2004), and about 500,000 land title certificates have been issued
to farmers. Transactions in the land market are beginning to increase. For
example, the number o f business transactions with agricultural land plots
increased from about 2,000 in 2001 to more than 4,500 during the first 8 months
o f 2003, M a n y irrigation systems are now more efficient and farmers are
increasingly taking over responsibility for managing and financing operations and
maintenance o f their systems.
Armenia's good performance means that the country has met all o f the triggers for
moving to the high case. However, because privatization o f electricity distribution took
longer than expected (due mainly to changing market conditions rather than lack o f
government commitment) i t did not meet them in time to develop a PRSC, the high case
deliverable, within the period.

5. How I D A contributed t o Armenia's progress
The 2001 CAS contained a l i s t o f indicators that i t expected to influence and targets for
meeting them. Table 2 outlines the targets and the current status as well as the IDA
instruments that affected each indicator. I t shows that Armenia has met almost all o f the
targets, w i t h significant assistance from IDA interventions.

The precise l i n k s between long-term goals, outcomes that could be achieved
during the CAS period, and the mechanisms by which IDA aimed to help
Armenia meet those goals were not specified in the 2001 CAS.
The indicators were not used as a management tool during CAS implementation.
Some indicators were not appropriate: one (quality o f water in rural areas) was
not associated with any IDA interventions; another (girls’ school enrollment rates)
was never a problem; and another (share o f irrigation water users’ associations
receiving 5,000m3 water per hectare) was not measurable at the time.
The effects o f some planned interventions (e.g. the Natural Resources
Management Project) were not captured in any indicators.

Future CASs will endeavor to make the indicators and their baseline data clearly accepted
by all involved, the l i n k s to the interventions more explicit and to use the indicators as a
management tool throughout CAS implementation.

There were no severe exogenous shocks over the period o f the last CAS that affected the
achievement o f those outcomes. The price o f wheat coming from Russia increased
markedly in the summer o f 2003 but did not raise inflation rates or otherwise affect
macroeconomic indicators. The severe frost in winter o f 2002-2003 severely damaged
wine and h i t crops for several agricultural areas but this does not seem to have affected
the CAS outcomes.
CAS implementation did not have any unintended negative impacts that the team i s
aware of. There was no unanticipated environmental damage; indeed the irrigation, water
supply, energy and natural resource management projects have contributed to
environmental improvements by reducing wastage o f natural resources and helping the
Government reorganize i t s environmental management system.

The primary gender issue for women in Armenia relates to poor reproductive health
behavior (over h a l f o f all pregnancies end in abortion). IDA interventions during the 2001

-49-

CAS period made significant progress in improving the health and education systems in
general, but have not yet included specific actions to improve women’s reproductive
health behavior, nor have they specifically addressed HIV/AIDS, in part because other
donors have programs in these areas. A forthcoming study has assessed the problem o f
reproductive health and will propose potential actions, some o f which will be followed up
in the FY04 Health project. Changes in the labor market appear to have hit women hard,
as the female share o f employment f e l l in the 1990s and the gender wage gap was 80% in
2000.17 Armenia also has two important male gender issues: excess male mortality (men
have a l i f e expectancy around ten years lower than that o f women) and boys dropping out
o f secondary school, particularly in rural areas. The FY04 health and education projects
include specific measures to tackle this problem.

6. IDA’s performance
IDA’s performance overall was satisfactory. In consultations, government officials
consistently state that they value their relationship with IDA highly. The 2002 client
survey indicates satisfaction with IDA, with a mean favorability rating o f 7.8 on a scale
o f 10. Staff continuity was good in most sectors, with the possible exception o f public
sector modernization. OED’s C A E was released in late December 2003 and broadly
confirms this assessment.’*
Quality. The quality o f IDA’S products and services was generally good. Internal
reporting systems (PSRs, CPPRs) indicate that the portfolio i s performing well. All
projects are rated satisfactory and there are no problem projects. The disbursement ratio”
i s satisfactory. At the end o f FY03 i t was 20.2% compared to an E C A average o f 19.8%.
The portfolio i s relatively young, with an average age o f 3.3 years. Sixty percent o f
projects are in the first three years o f implementation with the remainder are in the final
stages o f implementation. E S W has mostly been well received by the Government and
many o f the recommendations are being implemented. The team has produced four
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) over the CAS implementation period, three
o f which have been reviewed by OED.*’ Q A G has reviewed 9 activities that are covered
by the 2001 CAS, and all are rated satisfactory or above.21

Executive Summary o f the C A E noted “the Bank’s assistance has made a major contribution to the
maintenance o f macroeconomic stability, which facilitated the economic recovery and growth.” “..the
Bank has had a significant impact through i t s AAA and lending in helping to establish a new social benefit
system, well targeted to the poor. The Bank has also had a major impact o n improvements in the efficiency
o f the education sector and o n the increased availability o f energy. In transport and agriculture, the Bank’s
assistance has likewise made important contributions.. .but major problems were l e f t unresolved.” “The
Bank’s program had some success in private sector development.. .but much remains to be done to improve
the business environment, especially in the promotion o f small and medium job-creating enterprises.” “On
balance.. ..OED rates the outcome o f the Bank’s assistance strategy as satisfactory.” “The Bank’s overall
contribution to institutional development i s rated as substantial.” “Balancing the risks and benefits suggests
that the sustainability o f the Bank’s assistance program should be considered likely.”

Use o f AAA work. IDA made good use o f analytical and advisory work during the CAS
period. Strong analytical work complemented adjustment and investment projects
particularly effectively in the energy and education sectors. IDA’Sunderstanding o f
poverty issues in Armenia i s relatively good, and the work i s well integrated into the
program. The data are disaggregated by gender, which allows the team to mainstream
gender issues where relevant, and to follow up when particular issues arise, such as the
detailed analytical work o n women’s reproductive health currently underway. The
portfolio has also benefited from thorough analytical work o n the environment, which has
been mainstreamed into many sectoral and capacity-building interventions, such as water
supply and sanitation, energy, heating and irrigation.
Capacity enhancement. The World Bank Institute (WBI) program was relatively
limited. WBI has focused on a South Caucasus regional program on fiscal
decentralization and development o f local government capacity over the last two years,
and on PRSP dialogues among the CIS-7 countries. They have recently started a training
program o n pension reform that will complement the forthcoming F Y 0 4 pension credit.
Participants have generally rated the activities as very successful and relevant, but asked
that activities be broadened and made more continuous.
Delivery o f products. As Table 4 shows, by the end o f FY04, the planned lending
program will have been delivered. The 2001 CAS planned 10 new investment projects
and, by the end o f FY04, 10 will have been delivered -- eight that were planned in the
CAS and two that were not envisaged. One project (Urban Heating) has not yet been
approved but the Government i s already piloting operations under a PPF. IDA delivered
the planned number o f AAA activities proposed in the 2001 CAS, though they covered a
somewhat different m i x o f topic areas (see Table 5).

The program did however suffer from substantial slippage. Around h a l f o f the activities
were delivered at least one fiscal year later than planned. Some delays resulted from
decisions deliberately taken in response to changing circumstances. For example, the
Municipal Water and Wastewater project was moved from FY02 to F Y 0 4 because
responsibility for the sector within the Government shifted, the Bank’s policy changed,
and country management wanted to assess progress implementing the Municipal
Development Project. Other delays, however, were caused by insufficient availability o f
key Bank staff and/or staff turnover. This was a particular problem for the Public Sector
Reform Project. Given the centrality o f improving public sector management to the 2001
CAS, delivering the related project at the end o f the FY04, rather than in FY02 as
planned, i s an important omission.

and Management Reform Project rated the outcome as highly satisfactory; OED concurred. The Enterprise
Development Project rated i t s outcome as satisfactory; OED rated i t as moderately unsatisfactory with
unsatisfactory Bank performance and unlikely sustainability. They conclude that project design was poor.

The work o f different parts o f the World Bank Group has been mutually complementary,
though IDA has dominated. The I F C has only a small program in Armenia, with two
active projects and one fund, which has yet to be capitalized. The IFC has had difficulties
finding industrial investments o f sufficient scale and has only recently begun to find
creditworthy banks to which it can make significant line-of-credit investments. IDA i s
working w i t h MIGA on the Foreign Investment and Export Facilitation Project, with
MIGA leading the capacity building program, although MIGA does not yet have any
active guarantees in Armenia.

7. Aid coordination
Over the 1990s, Armenia had reasonably high levels o f official development assistance
per capita at an average o f US$16 per person per year or around 11% o f GDP. IDA has
successfully worked with donors to maximize development impact in many areas. A
donor consultation process was established in the CAS and followed up during
implementation, including a Consultative Group meeting in FY02.
Donor coordination has not been without difficulties, however. The I C R for the SATAC
project concluded that better donor coordination at the outset would have allowed the
borrower to leverage more grant funding, allowing IDA technical assistance to better
complement that bilateral support by financing the use o f local consultants. The high
availability o f donor funds has caused particular problems in areas, such as public sector
modernization, that require substantial technical assistance. The Government was
reluctant to borrow, when considerable grant financing i s available for these purposes.
Cooperation with the IMF has been excellent. Fund conditionalities blended well with
those o f IDA. The IMF program has been in line with I-PRSP and now with the recently
published PRSP and remains broadly on track.

8. Overall assessment o f CAS performance
The team judges the CAS performance as satisfactory in those areas where IDA
influenced results directly. Armenia made significant progress towards all o f the planned
CAS outcomes and IDA played a significant role in helping the country achieve results.
Although rural areas did not progress at the same rate as urban areas, Armenia has seen
some success, and IDA was instrumental in those successes. Furthermore the
improvements in the social assistance programs probably prevented actual worsening o f
poverty in rural areas. Given the limited resources, i t i s hard to assess what else IDA
could have done to help in the rural areas.
Progress in rationalizing health and education infrastructure has perhaps proceeded more
slowly than envisaged. However, a stronger emphasis o n this would possibly have
detracted from the more immediate needs o f improving the quality and access to primary
healthcare and forestalling any further declines in the quality o f basic education. IDA

-52-

was unable to help the Government forestall the growth o f private payments for
healthcare, which i s a major reason that people, especially the poor, do not use health
services. Recent evidence, however, indicates that the poverty family benefit has
protected the poor and increased the probability that they will use healthcare services if
they fall sick. IDA did not help the Government develop a strategy to tackle H I V / A I D S
as planned in the 2001 CAS, because UNAIDS and the Global Fund led these initiatives.
The delivery schedule proposed in the 2001 CAS was over-optimistic about staff time
availability, particularly for AAA work. This meant that many deliverables slipped one or
more fiscal years.

9. Lessons for subsequent CAS design
(a) The areas of focus in the CAS were appropriate and the mix of interventions
supported the objectives well. Both should be continued. Given the substantial
progress Armenia has made and the contributions that the IDA program made to that
progress, the team concludes that IDA selected i t s goals appropriately. The activities all
contributed to the desired outcomes and no activities were redundant. Given resource and
capacity constraints both in IDA and in the Government, it i s hard to see what additional
activities IDA should have undertaken. The future CAS will, however, need to pay
explicit attention to ensuring that the benefits from economic growth have wider impact.

(b) The best results were achieved when IDA was able to exploit the synergies
between well-sequenced analytical work, investment and adjustment lending, and to
leverage trust funds and donor activities. The chosen blend o f policy based and
investment lending worked well for the most part. Substantial levels o f trust funding
enabled the team to prepare projects and analytical work and maintain a substantive
dialog. Other donors also had a vital role in achieving many o f the CAS objectives,
providing long-term technical assistance in areas that require sustained efforts. During the
2001 CAS period this was particularly noticeable in the energy sector, in tax and customs
reform, agricultural extension, Treasury implementation, civil service development, and
macroeconomic and monetary policy formulation. These initiatives will need to be
duplicated and perhaps intensified in the forthcoming CAS.
(c) The outcome indicators for the 2001 CAS should have been linked more clearly
to IDA interventions to facilitate evaluation of CAS performance. Future CASs will
endeavor to make the indicators and their baseline data clearly accepted by all involved,
the l i n k s to the interventions more explicit and to use the indicators as a management tool
throughout CAS implementation.

(d) Devolving responsibility for portfolio management to the country manager and
some task management responsibilities to country office staff improved portfolio
performance considerably. The country manager and field office staff are close to the
projects and the counterparts. For that reason, and because they work exclusively o n
Armenia rather than on several countries, they were able to focus o n the Armenia

-53-

portfolio and remove obstacles to progress and highlight potential problems before they
materialized.
(e) A strong team in the country office was important for achieving results. High
caliber staff working as a multi-sectoral team in Yerevan, w i t h some responsibility for
task management, helped provide efficient quality services to the client and to maintain a
good dialog w i t h senior officials. Future work should be designed to benefit from this
team as much as possible

( f ) The CAS was not realistic enough about staff availability and programming.
M a n y o f the interventions programmed in the previous CAS were delivered one or two
fiscal years behind schedule, although the total number o f activities and lending volume
remained roughly as planned. Many factors caused this, some not within the control o f
country team members. In some cases, however, slippage was the result o f key staff not
being available at the right time. During preparation and implementation o f the future
CAS, management needs to pay explicit attention to advance staff planning to ensure that
key people are available at the right time for key deliverables.
(g) I n a country experiencing rapid economic growth, it i s difficult to ensure that all
geographic areas and segments of the population benefit equally. Clearly, some parts
o f the country have progressed faster than others, but i t i s far from clear what could have
been done to avoid that, Indeed, without the improvements in social assistance programs,
the situation in lagging regions would probably have been even worse.

(h) Knowledge and capacity gaps remain. Although IDA’Sinterventions together with
those o f other donors were reasonably effective in addressing capacity issues, much
remains to be done. Armenia could probably have benefited from an expanded World
Bank Institute (WBI) program for this purpose. The primary knowledge gaps relate to
constraints to increasing on- and off-farm incomes in rural areas, and to the dynamics o f
the labor market (this was identified in the previous CAS, but dropped because o f staff
availability). The latter would help IDA understand gender issues in the labor force. IDA
will tackle these issues in the next CAS period.

(i)The CAS consultation process was extensive and coincided largely with the even
more thorough government-led consultation process for the PRSP. The Government
has committed to continue consultations throughout PRSP implementation, and IDA will
b e part o f that process. Therefore, consultations o n future CASs can benefit from the
PRSP consultations, can be more focused, and consider how IDA can best support the
Government’s PRSP priorities.

Annex 3: Proposed WBI Program FY05-08
The World Bank Institute (WBI) i s the learning and capacity-building arm o f the World Bank
Group, and supports the building o f institutional and human capacity in client countries to fight
poverty and reach development objectives.

WBI activities for Armenia currently implemented or planned form part o f the broader
Caucasus or other regional programs:
0

As part o f the Caucasus program, Armenian participants take part in (i)
workshops on

territorial and administrative decentralization and financial viability o f local self-governments.

This ongoing support will be complemented by further activities o n intergovernmental

relations and urban management; and (ii)
videoconferences o n pension reform options for
current systems, with a proposed follow-up program o n related implementation issues.

Within the CIS-7 program, Armenia participates in periodical workshops or videoconferences

where various aspects o f the PRSP process are discussed among PRSP teams or other
agencies from the seven selected countries.

During the implementation o f the CAS, WBI will align its activities with the development
objectives identified in the CAS. This will be done through close collaboration with the Southern
Caucasus Country U n i t and other relevant E C A units w i t h the aim to deliver client responsive and
demand driven activities, possibly integrated in current and future Bank supported projects. In doing
so:
0

0

Efforts will be made to make activities broader and more continuous. The events carried out
to date are generally well received by participants, but often judged to be too short and selfstanding, and therefore not to have the desired impact or sustainability. By pursuing
additional local and regional partnerships with NGOs, c i v i l society, Government and donors, a
more sustained presence o f learning activities should be sought. This could involve a greater
number and variety o f learning events including distance learning and web based training
courses, as well as locally sponsored workshops. Discussions to identify national partners in
Armenia that would j o i n the GDLN network will continue, w i t h the aim o f having a suitable
agency identified in the early part o f the CAS period.
Priority will be given to sub-regional activities, either in the South Caucasus or CIS-7 context.

WBI activities during the CAS period will support both the growth and poverty alleviation
related CAS goals. They include follow-up activities based o n the current program in local
government and fiscal decentralization for the South Caucasus, and the continuation o f the PRSP
dialogues. The work o n pension reform will also continue.
To the extent possible, depending on resource availability and a continued good policy
climate, WBI would consider becoming engaged in selective additional activities. Related to public
management issues, this would include but not necessarily be limited to implementation o f the

-62-

Government’s anti-corruption strategy, and support to the recently expanded utilities regulator
(commission o n natural monopolies). Further training o f civil servants in areas o f economics, finance
and impact analysis (including environmental) i s also desirable. To further support the private sector
led growth goal, possible additional activities would include corporate governance programs in
collaboration with local partners and support to the committee on competition policy.

The preliminary program o f leaming activities that WBI will deliver over the CAS period i s
presented in Table 1. Actual leaming events will be carried out following the preparation o f annual
programs tailored to the rest o f the Bank and other donor agencies, and defined in collaboration w i t h
the CMU and the Government.

Annex 5: Core Labor Standards
1.
The Right of Association. The Constitution provides employees with the right to form and
j o i n trade unions, although i t stipulates that the right to form associations, including political parties
and trade unions, may be limited for those persons serving in the armed services and law enforcement
agencies. In practice, labor organization remained weak because o f high unemployment and the weak
economy. The absence o f active unions and o f accurate employment data precluded a reliable
estimate o f the percentage o f the workforce that i s unionized. Unions are free to affiliate w i t h
international organizations; however, none had done so to date.
2.
Labor Rights. Although the law provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively,
collective bargaining does not occur in practice. Factory directorates generally set the pay scales
without consultation w i t h employees. Labor disputes are arbitrated in regular or economic courts.
The Constitution provides for the right to strike; however, workers had neither the financial resources
to maintain a strike nor enforceable legal protection against retaliation, and existing unions play a
relatively passive role. The standard legal workweek was 40 hours; however, many persons work
multiple jobs in order to provide for basic necessities. The law provides for annual and sick leave;
however, there were no mandated rest periods. Compensation for overtime work i s required; the
amount depends o n the position and type o f employment.

3.
Forced, Bonded and Child Labor. The Constitution and the law prohibit forced and bonded
labor, including by children, and there have been no reports that such practices occur. According to
the law, 16 years i s the minimum age for employment. Children may work from the age o f 14 w i t h
the permission o f a medical commission and the relevant labor union board. The law i s enforced by
local community councils, unemployment offices, and, as a final board o f appeal, the courts. The
Government has not ratified I L O Convention 182 on the worst forms o f child labor.

4.
Trafficking in Persons. Armenia i s a country o f origin for international trafficking o f girls
and women for prostitution. Trafficking appears to come from orphanages and from families who
allegedly press their daughters to sell themselves into prostitution. The Government o f Armenia does
not yet comply with the minimum standards for the elimination o f trafficking. In 2003, however, the
Armenian Government acknowledged the need for increased action against trafficking, and has
focused more law enforcement resources o n the problem. A new inter-agency task force has
coordinated public awareness efforts throughout the country, including pamphlet distribution at the
borders. The Government’s Refugee and Migration Service included information o n trafficking in an
edition o f its journal on legal migration, and houses an IOM-funded Migration Service Point with a
hotline, allowing people to call or come in to ask about migration issues, including trafficking. The
Office advertises the hotline in newspapers. In April 2003, Armenia amended i t s criminal code to
include a specific criminal prohibition against trafficking for sexual exploitation. Before then,
traffickers could be prosecuted under such articles as illicit seizure, falsification and selling o f
personal documents, extortion, bogus marriages and divorces, and coercion into sexual intercourse.
The Government has instituted anti-corruption efforts in the Customs Committee and upgraded the
technology at the borders to combat trafficking. In 2002, 26 criminal cases were brought against
pimps, including four charges against traffickers involved in organizing illegal border crossings with
false documents. Subsequent figures are not yet available.

Annex 9 : IMF- IDA Relations
Partnership in Armenia’s Development Strategy

1.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Armenia in enhancing macroeconomic stability
and advancing reforms to sustain high rates o f economic growth. In this regard, the Fund has
encouraged the authorities to pursue a prudent fiscal policy (including by increasing tax revenues
and reducing domestic expenditure arrears), implement a number o f tax and expenditure
measures, and proceed with key reforms on the banking and energy sectors. The IMF Board
approved a new three-year program under the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) in M a y 2001. The fifth review was completed in M a y 2004. The Government met all o f
the program’s quantitative and structural performance criteria at end-December 2003, as well as
two o f the five structural benchmarks scheduled for implementation up to March 2004.
IDA has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural issues, focusing on: (i)
2.
strengthening public expenditure management; (ii)
deepening and diversifying sources o f growth,
(iii)
protecting the environment; and (iv) reducing poverty. Table A below summarizes the
division o f responsibility between the two institutions. In a number o f areas - for example the
social sectors, rural development, environment, and infrastructure (other than energy) - IDA takes
the lead in the dialogue and there i s no cross conditionality with the IMF-supported program.
IDA i s also leading the dialogue on private sector reform, and IDA analysis serves as inputs into
the Fund program. In other areas - structural reform, private sector development, the financial
sector, public expenditure management, and revenue and customs - both institutions work
together. Finally, in areas like monetary policy the IMF takes the lead w i t h little IDA
involvement.
Areas in which I D A leads and there is no direct IMF involvement

3.
Areas in which IDA leads and there i s no direct IMF involvement include the social
sectors, infrastructure and environment.
In social investment and protection, IDA i s focusing, through Social Investment Fund
credits in particular, o n helping to provide basic infrastructure to the poorest communities.
Assistance has also been provided to the government in designing and implementing a
family benefit system, which has become an effective and well-targeted means to support
poor households. IDA i s preparing a Social Protection Administration Credit to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness o f the delivery o f social protection benefits. A focus o n
the vulnerable will also be provided through a Labor Market Study and Programmatic
Poverty Assessments. The Social Protection Administration Project will also help
strengthen the regional employment agencies, which will allow the government to help
qualified applicants find potential employers. IDA conducts periodic updates o f the
Poverty Assessments based on household survey data.
In education IDA has been helping the Government make the healthcare system more
responsive to the needs o f the poor. An Education Quality and Relevance Project, along
with proposed PRSCs and a PRSC TA, will help the Government improve enrollment
rates and education quality. The Social Investment Fund credits support rehabilitation o f

-73-

school buildings, and a proposed urban heating project will help modernize heating
systems in selected schools.

In health care IDA i s helping improve access through a Health Systems Modernization
Project. Public health will also benefit from other proposed IDA-supported projects: a
Yerevan Water Project, an Urban Heating project, and possibly an Infrastructure Project i f
i t includes improvements in transport in remote areas. Programmatic Public Expenditure
Reviews will identify issues relating to healthcare spending and propose solutions.
In rural development on-going IDA support includes an Agricultural Reform Support
Credit, a Title Registration Project, an Irrigation D a m Safety and an Irrigation
Development project, as well as studies o n rural productivity and o n rural infrastructure.
The Health and Education projects are addressing the quality o f rural services, and a
Trans-Caucasus Tourism Initiative i s helping promote the off-farm economy in select rural
areas. Other new interventions under preparation include a Rural Development Project.
In infrastructure IDA i s helping improve access through the Municipal Development and
Armenia Water projects, which are contributing to improved drinking water services.
Proposed new interventions include the Urban Heating Project, the second Yerevan Water
Project, and the Infrastructure Project.
In the environment IDA i s supporting work o n natural resource management, and will
support a Country Environment Assessment. In addition IDA will support a Renewable
Energy Project to reduce Armenia’s dependence on imported fossil fuels: the Urban
Heating project, which will reduce demand for fuelwood for heating; the Rural
Development Project which will assess the options for sustainable forest and natural
resource based income generation activities; and the water supply projects, which together
with any additional investment in irrigation, will improve water resource management.

Areas in which I D A leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMFprogram
0

0

0

IDA has been leading the dialogue o n structural reforms through a series o f five
Structural Adjustment Credits, and will continue to provide support the proposed PRSCs.
Institution building and technical assistance has been supported through a Structural
Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit.
In private sector development IDA i s supporting improvements in the business
environment through a Public Sector Reform Credit and a Judicial Reform Project. The
SACS and the proposed PRSCs and PRSC TA include support for tax reform and
improvements in the application o f accounting standards. IDA’SAnalytical and Advisory
program includes financial sector advisory services that will help improve corporate
governance, as will IDFs o n public procurement and competition policy. Regular business
surveys will help monitor results.

Improvement in the financial system will be assisted through advisory and analytical
work (such as the Financial Sector Advisory Notes and the Country Economic
Memorandum on pro-poor growth), sequenced w i t h programmatic support to reforms
through the series o f PRSCs. These interventions will promote an increase o f minimum
capital requirements for the banking sector, establishment o f a credit bureau, as well as

-74-

new legislation relating to the banking sector. In the context o f the PRSCs, IDA will also
provide support for anti-money laundering and combating the financing o f terrorism
through support for the adoption o f comprehensive legislation, the establishment o f a
Financial Intelligence Unit, and the training o f government and financial institution
officials.

Public Sector Management. IDA i s supporting improved public sector management
through the Public Sector Reform Credit that tackles civil service reform, public
procurement, and e-government, as well as through a Judicial Reform Project. A planned
series o f PRSCs and the PRSC TA will tackle many related issues, including tax reform,
increased transparency o f the budget process at central and local levels, and application o f
accounting standards. A possible further Public Sector Project would also address
problems in this area. The Analytical and Advisory program supports these interventions
through the Country Financial Accountability Assessment, and through financial sector
advisory services. The Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews, and the Country
Economic Memorandum, will help diagnose problems and monitor outcomes, and the
