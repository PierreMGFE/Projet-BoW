B O S N I A AND HERZEGOVINA
M e m o r a n d u m to the Executive Directors of the IDA and IBRD
Country Assistance Strategy (FY05 - 07)
Executive Summary

i. Since the end o f the war (1992-95), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has made
tremendous progress in post-conflict reconstruction, social integration, and state building.
Nine years after the war, the country i s working toward accession to the European Union (EU),
membership in the WTO, and association with the Partnership for Peace o f NATO. Based o n i t s
impressive post-conflict economic recovery and sustained social stability, supported by high
levels of international assistance, BH can be considered a post-conflict success story. Since 1995
GDP has tripled, merchandise exports are up tenfold, while price stability has been maintained
with inflation rates below 1 percent in the past two years, based o n a currency board arrangement.
The World Bank has played a significant role in BH since 1996, as was recently recognized by
OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation’ (CAE), which found that the overall outcome o f the
Bank’s contribution to the reconstruction program was highly successful.
ii.
However, BH’s track record in structural reforms has been mixed. The banking sector
has been successfully privatized, a liberal trade policy has been implemented, a significant fiscal
adjustment has been achieved, the social sectors have seen f i r s t successful reforms, and
improvements in public finance have been made across the board. Importantly, coordination
among the many governmental agencies has been greatly improved, and coordinating functions o f
the state level strengthened. However, consolidated public expenditure consumes 54 percent of
GDP, and the recorded current account deficit stands at a very high 19 percent. Early attempts at
privatization have resulted in diluted ownership and weak governance, and large company
divestiture has been painfully slow. The business-enabling environment i s not yet as investor
friendly as i t needs to be to attract the levels o f investment required for sustained levels of
economic growth of 5 to 6 percent per year, as forecast in the recently approved Medium-Term
Development Strategy (MTDS), the country’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
iii. BH now has to significantly speed up reforms to b e able to compete with other transition
economies, which have had roughly a decade longer to increase overall competitiveness, as the
country strives for deeper integration into European and global markets. Despite impressive
growth rates, the GDP stands at only 70 percent o f i t s pre-war level, and income poverty i s s t i l l
high at 20 percent, with an additional 30 percent o f citizens living just above the poverty line.
The country urgently needs to bring down the high share o f public expenditure in the economy,
increase efficiency and transparency in public finance and the corporate sector, make room for
private sector-led growth, thereby tackling high levels o f unemployment, particularly among
youth, and address the high current account deficit.
iv. The proposed C A S for BH covers FY05-07. It builds o n two previous full CASs (FY9899 and FY00-02) and two C A S Progress Reports (FYOO-01 and FY02-04). It builds on BH’s
“Bosnia and Herzegovina, Country Assistance Evaluation,” April 2004, Operations Evaluation Department,
World Bank.

i

track record over the last nine years, and i s informed by the recent CAE. The proposed C A S i s
anchored in the country’s M T D S which lays out three overarching objectives to be pursued from
2004-2007: (i)
to create conditions for sustainable and balanced economic development, and to
to reduce poverty by one
achieve partial creditworthiness in the international capital markets; (ii)
fifth; and (iii)
to accelerate EU integration. This CAS supports the M T D S priorities by focusing
o n three mutually reinforcing pillars: (a) improving public finance and strengthening institutions;
(b) promoting sustainable private sector-led growth; and (c) investing in key social and economic
infrastructure. The CAS strives to help Government reduce the weight o f the public sector on the
economy, a prerequisite to giving the private sector room to grow, thereby stimulating productive
activity, domestic private and public savings and export growth. The Bank will also support
greater efficiency o f the public sector, particularly in the delivery o f pro-poor social and economic
infrastructure services, while improving governance in both private and public sectors.
v.
The CAS proposes US$152 million in IDA lending in the base case, plus US$20.5
million in GEF grants, as well as support from IFC, MIGA and WBI. Base case lending
would be strongly performance based and centered around programmatic adjustment lending in
support o f public sector reform and private sector development. L o w case lending would shift
support from adjustment lending to focused capacity building projects for public sector reform
and social sector delivery. Provided that BH’s performance i s significantly improved, moving the
economy toward creditworthiness, the country would also have access to IBRD lending o f US$30
m i l l i o n in the high case at the end o f the C A S period. Building upon a significant active portfolio,
the C A S links the country’s o w n objectives, as spelled out in the MTDS, with the Bank’s strategy
and interventions, summarized in a results-oriented matrix.

vi.
While short-term risks are considered moderate, a number of internal and external
risks remain during the CAS period. A weakening political commitment to reform, in
particular in view o f municipal (2004) and national (2006) elections, could cause slippages in
reform. The current ruling coalitions are strained, and social pressure i s likely to increase in the
C A S period. The incentives o f EU accession and prospects for improved livelihoods for all
citizens, i f effectively communicated to the population, will help mitigate this risk. In t e r m s o f
extemal risks, BH’s macroeconomic position would be further threatened in the face o f lower than
expected foreign direct investment, sluggish demand for BH’s exports, and stronger than
anticipated declines in aid. An overly ambitious international community, overestimating BH’s
absorptive capacity to reform, could h r t h e r strain the already l o w implementation capacity and
lead to setbacks. In addition, instability in the Southeast Europe region could negatively impact
sensitive investor perceptions. Overall, the level o f risk i s considered moderate and the proposed
strategy i s viewed as the most appropriate w a y for the W o r l d Bank Group to help mitigate these
risks while continuing i t s support for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

B O S N I A AND HERZEGOVINA
M e m o r a n d u m to the Executive Directors o f the IDA and IBRD
Country Assistance Strategy (FY05 - 07)

I.Introduction
1. T h e proposed CAS for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) covers FY05-07. It builds o n two
previous full CASs (FY98-99 and FY00-02) and two CAS Progress Reports (FYOO-01 and
FY03-04). I t i s informed by BH’s track record over the last nine years, as also reviewed in the
recent Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE).2
Furthermore, the strategy i s anchored in the country’s recently approved first Medium-Term
Development Strategy (MTDS). The C A S has been prepared in consultation with the authorities
and international partners and immediately follows a comprehensive Government-led two year
consultation process informing the MTDS, discussed by the Board o n June 15, 2004. The CAS
links the medium-term, country-level M T D S objectives with those o f the Bank’s program o f
assistance, providing for a results-oriented framework.

2. In the M T D S , BH has committed itself at the highest levels o f government to pursue
three objectives in parallel during 2004-07: (a) economic and social development; (b) poverty
reduction; and (c) progress in the accession process to the European U n i o n (EU). BH has made
remarkable progress since the end of the war in 1995, with generous assistance from the
international community. BH’s priority economic challenge n o w i s to move from a largely aiddependent economy to one led by private sector growth, while reducing high levels o f
unemployment and poverty and improving the livelihoods o f all i t s citizens.

Political Background and Recent Developments

3.
During the first half o f the 1990s (1992-95), BH experienced the most devastating
violent conflict and collapse o f any European economy since W o r l d War 11. The war altered
the social and economic landscape o f the country, took a heavy t o l l on i t s population, and caused
widespread physical damage. By the time hostilities ceased in late 1995, o f a pre-war population
of 4.4 million, an estimated 250,000 people had lost their lives or were considered missing,
200,000 to 400,000 people had been wounded, and an estimated 2.5 m i l l i o n people, more than
h a l f the population, either left the country as refugees o r were internally displaced. The economy
plummeted to less then 20 percent o f i t s pre-war level, by far the steepest decline among all
Central and Eastern European countries since the fall o f the Berlin Wall. The Dayton Peace
Accords (DPA), signed in December 1995, provided the young state o f BH with a new and
and with a system o f international
complex internal governance structure (see Annex l),
oversight, both o f which have been sustained until today, with relatively few change^.^
See footnote 1.
The DPA, formally titled General Framework Agreement for Peace in BH, was agreed in Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A. on
November 25, 1995, and officially signed in Paris on December 14, 1995. It provides for four levels o f govemment.
The State o f BH i s at the highest level. The next level down consists o f two “Entities,” the Federation o f BH (FBH)
and the Republika Srpska (RS). The FBH i s highly decentralized, divided into 10 cantons (each with a prime minister,
cabinet, and parliament) and 80 municipalities. The R S i s organized in a more centralized fashion, with n o cantons,

4.
Today, after less than nine years o f peace, BH can be considered a post-conflict success
story. With strong support from the international community (IC), BH has made impressive
progress in post-war reconstruction and in economic, social, and political integration. The country
enjoys political stability and security, and i s n o w moving toward membership in Euro-Atlantic
structures. The reconstruction o f physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power and
communication networks, hospitals, and schools has been to a great extent completed.
Developments in recent years have seen enhanced internal harmonization o f the relatively
autonomous subnational Entities, while strengthening the coordination functions o f BH’s central
State. BH has become a member o f the Council o f Europe, i s working toward full World Trade
Organization (WTO) membership, and has started the long road toward European Union (EU)
accession and membership in the NATO Partnership for Peace (PFP) program.
5.
Initial concerns within the IC, that the return o f “ n a t i ~ n a l i s t ” ~parties to the
governments formed in early 2003 would reverse some o f the state-building achievements and
de-emphasize European integration, turned out to be unfounded. T o date, with the active support
of the Office o f the High Representative (OHR) and others in the IC, State and Entity
governments have continued to make progress toward building a cohesive state. For the first time
since the war, BH n o w has a single economic strategy, the Medium-Term Development Strategy
(MTDS 2004-07, BH’s PRSP). A Coordination Board for Economic Development and European
Integration, which includes Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers from the State and both
Entities, meets regularly to discuss the M T D S and particular policy issues.
6.
However, BH’s reform agenda i s far from complete, and many challenges remain. BH
i s s t i l l under supervision o f the OHR, and the Peace Implementation Council (PIC). The
Multinational Stabilization Force led by NATO (SFOR), and the European U n i o n Police Monitors
(EUPM) are helping to ensure peace and security. Within BH, the design and implementation o f
reforms s t i l l has to overcome the intricate political and institutional situation that arose from the
DPA. The multilayer government structure-while
necessary to achieve peace in 1995-has
proven to be complex, expensive (it absorbs 54 percent o f gross domestic product (GDP)),
cumbersome for decision making, inefficient in terms o f service delivery, and in many areas
incompatible with EU structures. It also allows vested interests to reap additional rents and to
profit from i t s rigidities and complexities. A divisive constitutional debate, in particular within the
Federation Entity, i s ongoing, with uncertain outcomes. However, there seem to be no prospects
for a “new Dayton”; hence changes will have to be agreed and implemented by the authorities
within current structures, with encouragement and support from international partners5. In
addition, Euro-Atlantic partners o f BH have underlined the necessity for full cooperation with the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague to enable further
progress in EU and PFP accession processes.

but with 62 municipalities. Since 2000, BH has also included an autonomous territory, the Brcko District. The D P A
also established the Office o f the High Representative (OHR), currently led by Lord Paddy Ashdown, with a mandate
to oversee the implementation o f the civil aspects o f the D P A (Annex 10 o f the DPA). The High Representative (HR)
has executive powers on civilian matters, including a legislative veto, imposition powers, and the legal capacity to
remove officials from office (the so-called Bonn Powers). The HR is endorsed by and also reports to the UN Security
Council. OHR i s overseen by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), comprising 55 countries and international
organizations.
“Nationalist” i s defined as promoting solely the interests o f either the Bosniaks, the Bosnian Croats, or the Bosnian
Serbs.
5 .
High Representative Ashdown speaks o f “using Dayton to change Dayton”.

7.
Further challenges lie in the continued and sustainable reintegration of refugees and
internally displaced persons (IDPs). While approximately 985,000 o f the estimated 2.5 million
refbgees and IDPs have n o w returned to their homes, the UN estimates that an additional 500,000
people are willing to return, but the lack o f employment opportunities, destroyed private property,
and hostility toward returnees prevent them from doing so. The sustainability o f the return
process therefore also remains a challenge.
8.
Speeding up reforms will require dealing with vested interests, but also changing the
mindset, by m o v i n g away from long-held statist convictions formed in pre-war periods and, more
recently, also influenced by aid dependency. M u c h o f BH’s hope, therefore, lies in i t s youth,
whose voice must now be strengthened (see Box 1).
Box 1. Youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina-Inclusion

and Empowerment

Young people in BH face many challenges including: (a) inadequate quality and relevance o f higher education;
(b) relatively high poverty and higher-than-average unemployment; (c) lack o f participation in decision-making
at all levels; and (d) lack o f access to and facilities for non-formal education, including culture, entertainment,
and information. With the high prevalence o f poverty among youth in the country linked to insufficient access to
the labor market, deepening the involvement o f this disenfranchised group within the overall country
development i s a main theme o f the FY05-07 CAS, as demonstrated by the following foreseen activities:
0
Mainstreaming of youth into ongoing and new Bank supported operations. Building upon the already
significant inputs o f youth to civil society’s contribution to the MTDS, concerted efforts w i l l be made to expand
the role of youth within the context o f the Bank’s ongoing program o f assistance to BH. This i s envisioned to
entail strengthening support for their critical role in the longer-term processes o f social reconciliation and
inclusion, and the more immediate consultative processes essential to effective M T D S implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation.
0
B H Youth Strategy. Leveraged by Bank support, an Italian Trust Fund Social Development Initiative
for South East Europe supports operations and builds capacity o f the Youth Department (YD) within the BH
Council of Ministers. The goal o f the YD i s to establish a national framework for addressing the special needs of

BH youth, principally by developing a youth inclusion and empowerment strategy (Le. Youth Action Plan),
conducting analytical work to identify best practices, and designing legislative frameworks regarding
employment, education, youth with special needs, and human trafficking. With this assistance, the YD w i l l also
be in a better position to play a more prominent role in coordinating the relevant activities o f various
international agencies (e.g. UNDP/UNV, OSCE and GTZ). The extensive findings and recommendations of the
2004 Bank report Young People in South Eastern Europe: From Risk to Empowerment w i l l inform Bank
support for the youth strategy.
0
Youth Voices. Talented and representative youth group has been established to engage in a systematic
dialogue to include their perspectives and needs in both M T D S and CAS implementation. This i s the first step in
launching the Youth Voices initiative for BH.
0
Global Development Learning Network (GDLN). The participation o f youth NGOs, young political
leaders, and students in various GDLN programs i s increasingly recognized as an important mechanism to
facilitate exchange o f knowledge and experiences with similar groups from other countries in the region. Two
events have raised interest among youth groups: Governance for Young Leaders and Defining Roles for Youth
& the Next Generation o f Leaders. The practice o f encouraging the participation of youth in GDLN events w i l l
continue throughout the CAS period.

Small Grants Program. As in previous years, priority w i l l be given to proposals developed by local
organizations and aimed primarily at addressing the needs o f the disabled, Roma and youth.

0

As an important next step in strengthening the relationship between the Bank and youth, a second global
Youth Development Conference, chaired by the President o f the World Bank, w i l l be held in Sarajevo in
September 2004, as a follow-up to the successful Paris conference in 2003.
0

9.
The strongest incentive for state building and reform i s the common vision o f joining a
wider Europe through the European Union’s Stabilization and Association Process (SAP).
In November 2003, the European Commission (EC) released i t s feasibility study for BH,
concluding that the opening o f negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) can
be envisioned, provided that BH makes significant progress toward implementation o f a number
o f reforms the EC has identified.6 T o a certain degree, this has depoliticized sensitive sovereignty
issues between State and Entity governments. Indeed, recent k e y state-building decisions, to unite
the defense command and control system under a state-level Ministry o f Defense (BH currently
s t i l l has two armies) and to set up a single customs and indirect tax administration, would have
been unimaginable only a few years ago, and must be seen as remarkable progress in such a short
time after the devastating war. The Bank’s program i s designed to be fully consistent with the
SAP process.
10. The role o f the I C i s also changing in BH. The SFOR i s reducing i t s troops from 12,000
to 7,000, and NATO i s preparing to hand over SFOR command structures to the EU in 2004.
European Union Policy Monitors (EUPM) i s also gradually reducing i t s personnel as local police
forces take over their full duties. N o w that the immediate post-conflict reconstruction period i s
completed, BH’s donor partners are increasingly switching to a more traditional “development”
mode, and are challenging the authorities to take full responsibility and speedily implement the
demanding reform agenda. The OHR i s also actively changing i t s role f r o m “doing” to
“monitoring” as the “push” o f the “Bonn Powers” (that is, the powers to impose laws) i s being
replaced by the “pull” o f the EU7. This will gradually give increasing space for BH governments
and parliaments to take full responsibility for overall governance o f the country, but it will also
seriously test their capacity and ability to do so. This process will require sustained technical and
financial support from the IC.
11. I n summary, BH appears to have overcome the major post-conflict hurdles. I t now
finds itself in the middle of i t s state-building agenda, while the bulk o f transition reforms aiming
at private sector development s t i l l l i e ahead. A shared vision o f BH as a single country-albeit
with a significant devolution o f authority to Entity, cantonal, and local govemments-eventually
taking i t s place within Europe, i s becoming more widely accepted across the country. The
challenges ahead center around completion of the state-building agenda, and more traditional
obstacles faced by transition economies, which will require not only strong local champions, but
the continued support o f BH’s partners.

B. Recent Economic Developments
12. Since 1995, BH has made significant progress in i t s economic development. However,
great challenges and risks remain, because BH has so f a r implemented only partial
structural reforms. Since 1995 the G D P o f BH has tripled, boasting as much as 40 percent
annual growth rates during 1995-98. Merchandise exports have increased tenfold, based o n one
of the most liberal trade policies in the region, marking an impressive economic rebound, even
compared with other post-conflict countries. Fueled by high levels o f international assistance
The EC has identified 16 key conditions for satisfactory progress in 2004. See also Annex 2.

2003.

(over US$5 billion during 1996-2003), real per capita consumption o f private households has
increased, and extreme poverty has been eliminated.
13. Macroeconomic performance under the International Monetary Fund (1MF)supported Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) approved in August 2002, and completed in
February 2004, has been satisfactory. The BH authorities have requested further IMF support,
and it i s envisioned that the successhl completion o f the SBA will lead to an agreement o n a
successor program in the course o f 2004 (see also Annex 3).

14. Backed by a currency board, inflation rates have stabilized at industrial country levels
(below 1 percent in 2002 and 2003), and the differential between the two Entities has been
reduced. International reserves have risen to four months’ import cover. The overall fiscal
balance has also dramatically improved from a deficit o f 9 percent in 1999 to a small surplus in
2003. Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) were adopted by both Entities in late
2003. In line with i t s 2004 MTEF, the FBH overall wage bill was reduced by 3 percent compared
to 2003, while in the RS, total payroll expenses rose by 4.4 percent, inconsistent with the RS
MTEF which had foreseen a reduction by 4.5 percent. A new framework for indirect taxation, the
Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA), has been agreed, and a VAT i s expected to replace the sales
tax in 2005 o r early 2006. The introduction of modem treasury systems at all levels of
government above municipalities has contributed to improved spending discipline. Major
advances have also been made in tax policy and administration (including countrywide
harmonization and improved collection enforcement).
15. However, growth rates dropped to 2.7 percent in 2003, and BH’s GDP at the end of
2003 stood at only 70 percent of its pre-war level. Unemployment i s estimated at 16 to 25
percent, and income poverty i s s t i l l rampant, with 20 percent o f the population living below, and
an additional 30 percent just above, the poverty line.
16. The former agreement reached with the IMF underscores the importance o f settling
the large overhang of domestic claims on Government (estimated by the IMF to be in excess of
200 percent o f GDP) at a cost not exceeding 10 percent o f 2003 GDP in N e t Present Value (NPV)
terms. Quantitative frameworks have been established to settle these claims, and moratoriums o n
the processing o f pending lawsuits were passed by Entity parliaments. While these actions are
essential f i r s t steps, uncertainties with regard to the implementation o f the settlement program
remain, ranging from possible legal challenges to political resistance and delays in the passage of
relevant laws.
17. Despite significant fiscal adjustment and declining foreign assistance, BH’s recorded
current account deficit remains large, and constitutes the greatest risk to the economy. The
current account deficit was rising until 2002, when i t reached 18.5 percent o f GDP. The modest
export expansion over 1999-2002 was accompanied by a similar growth o f imports. The fall in
imports for reconstruction was more than compensated by the growth o f other imports, partly
fueled by a sizeable increase in credit to households. Further fiscal contraction combined with a
policy-induced slowdown in credit growth, appear to have narrowed the current account deficit to
some 19 percent o f GDP in 2003. However, the present level o f national savings, at 5.6 percent of
GDP, i s well below that required to sustain long-term growth. In the face o f declining aid flows,
the hardening o f terms o n new lending, and the still high current account deficit, BH will have to
manage a further sizable increase in domestic savings to sustain macroeconomic stability.

5

18. In the past, BH has received significant relief on i t s external debt, under Paris Club
(October 1998) and London Club (December 1998) agreements. This debt relief, combined
with postwar growth and substantial non-debt-creating external assistance has led t o a significant
reduction in BH’s external debt burden. As a result, BH’s external debt i s low-lower than in all
other Southeast Europe (SEE) countries except Albania-and the country has a favorable debtservicing profile.
19. BH’s trade policy i s one o f the most liberal in the region and has led to a set o f bilateral
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). BH i s also actively pursuing WTO membership. However,
due to a perceived lack o f success in translating these reforms into improved trade performance,
the recent past has seen growing protectionist tendencies, particularly in the agriculture sector.
This resulted in a three-month suspension o f FTAs for certain agricultural products with Croatia
and Serbia and Montenegro (SaM). Going fonvard, the authorities will have to be cautious in this
area, limiting their actions to dealing with unfair trading practices within agreed rules, not to
jeopardize the overall benefits stemming from a liberal trade policy. Also, the limited supply
response to the favorable trade regime i s reinforcing signals that key structural reforms have been
insufficient, in particular in the areas o f business environment, enterprise, and labor market
reforms.

20. In terms o f structural reforms, much progress has been made in the finance sector, but
privatization and improvements in the business-enabling environment are lagging far
behind. M a n y o f the reforms previously mentioned occurred during a time when the overall
emphasis o f both the domestic authorities and the international community was mainly on
reconstruction and the maintenance o f peace and stability in the country. These are, therefore,
significant achievements for a post-conflict country. Reflecting a notable development in the
State-building process, recently passed laws mark progress towards implementing a single pledge
registry system, with the same rules, regulations and procedures applicable throughout BH. A
similar process i s underway to address business registration, although the overall pace o f relevant
reforms has been less satisfactory than anticipated. M a n y steps which are critical to creating a
“single economic space” and improving the competitiveness o f the economy remain outstanding.
21. With W o r l d Bank Group assistance, the banking sector has been successfully
privatized at low fiscal costs, recapitalized, and better regulated. The sector i s n o w considered
one of the strongest in the subregion, and benefits from a strong presence o f foreign banks.
According to the latest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) data published by the Central Bank o f
BH, nearly one-third (29 percent, Le. U S D ,466 m i l l i o n out o f U S D 1.6 billion FDI as o f June
2003) was invested in the banking sector, accompanied by additional portfolio investments o f
U S D 297 million. Major foreign investors include Austria, Croatia, Germany and Slovenia. This
i s seen as a major success o f the adjustment program, and provides a solid basis for future
economic growth in the real economy. The impact o n the real sector, however, i s difficult to
judge because most lending i s s t i l l directed towards households, with little going to the corporate
sector (anecdotal evidence suggests that the credit to households i s fueling the grey economy). In
this regard, much remains to be done to strengthen the legal and institutional framework
(including titling, judicial system, business registration) in which the real sector operates.
Furthermore, the authorities are considering n e w products to deepen the banking and non-banking
sectors (where one pending issue i s the adoption o f a leasing law, which if approved, i s
anticipated to allow for a substantial share o f medium-to-long-term credit).

22. While small and medium enterprise (SME) privatization has been successfully
completed, mass privatization o f non-strategic medium-size businesses has resulted in
6

diluted ownership and weak corporate governance, and large, strategic state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) remain virtually untouched. Indeed, the privatization o f larger enterprises
has been painfully slow, initially because o f vested interests, and later due to lukewarm political
commitment. Large-scale privatization and divestiture from utilities i s only recently showing
some progress, with key outstanding challenges continuing to be: (a) transparency o f the
privatization process (confronting vested interests including political resistance to selling strategic
SOEs to foreigners at perceived l o w prices); and, (b) taking the necessary steps to establish a
sound regulatory framework for utilities prior to privatization. The business environment in
general, while modestly improved, remains characterized by high barriers to entry and the
proliferation o f bureaucratic impediments. Also, so far, there has been virtually n o formal market
exit. However, bankruptcy laws have recently been adopted, albeit after long delays. Corporate
governance has been hampered by weak management supervision as a result o f inadequate
ownership and board structure rules. Despite improvements in labor legislation, significant labor
market rigidities remain’. As a result, wage inflation, consistently in excess o f productivity
growth, erodes the country’s competitiveness.
23. There has also been mixed progress in public administration and social sector reforms
and in improving coordination between the Entities and the State. N e w c i v i l service laws
establishing modem principles have been approved by State and Entity parliaments. After some
delays, veterans’ benefits reform laws were passed in M a y 2004 in both Entities, which i s
considered a major political breakthrough and will bring about more efficiency and equity in this
important cash transfer program. Groundbreaking reforms were also achieved in the defense
sector, with the centralization o f operational and administrative command and control structures at
the level o f the State. Nonetheless, in higher education, a State Framework L a w was not adopted
by State Parliament early in 2004, and a legal challenge has been brought to the Constitutional
Court on this matter. Overall, the multilayer government o f BH i s s t i l l fragmented, discouraging
foreign investment and labor mobility, increasing business costs, denying equitable access to
services, hindering the efficient use of public resources, and impeding the operation o f basic
public control and accountability mechanisms. L o w quality statistical data i s also a serious
constraint to adequate policy formulation and monitoring. The current fragmented system i s
therefore in urgent need o f reform.

24. The Anti-Corruption Action Plan of February 2002 i s being implemented, and was
reaffirmed in the MTDS. Through the MTDS, the authorities again acknowledged the
detrimental effects o f corruption o n poverty reduction and economic development. In doing so,
they have recommitted themselves to action, including in the areas o f judicial, tax administration
and public procurement reform, as w e l l as improved public administration, public finance
management, and transparency in privatization (see Annex 4). Most o f the legislative and
institutional activities foreseen in the 2002 Action Plan have been completed or are ongoing. In
this context, the Council of Ministers recently submitted to Parliament a new State L a w on Public
Procurement, which i s fully harmonized with the relevant EU directive and follows the
recommendations set forth in the Bank’s Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).

* The adoption o f modem labor legislation in 2001, supported under the Bank’s SOSAC, reformed labor laws

~~

governing conditions o f employment and j o b placement, strengthened core labor standards in BH, and reduced
gender-related problems associated with access to employment. The implementation o f provisions ruling out
discrimination in employment, forced or compulsory labor or child labor and guaranteeing freedom o f
association and the right to collective bargaining are being closely monitored by domestic and international
actors.

C. BH in the Southeast European Region

25. Southeast Europe (SEE) has historically been a highly interrelated and interdependent
region, from an economic, social, cultural, environmental and, increasingly, again, from a
political perspective. BH’s economy i s among the smallest in the region, and can therefore greatly
benefit from close economic ties with i t s neighbors. BH i s also the income-poorest country of the
former Yugoslavia (see Table 1). The prospects o f BH’s development cannot be seen in isolation
from i t s neighbors in the region. All countries in SEE (except Moldova) are in various stages of
their EU accession processes. Integration among SEE countries must therefore also be seen as part
o f a broader process o f integration into European structures. The expectation i s that integration
across SEE will consolidate stability and prosperity in the region.

26. The SEE region has made progress across a broad front in recent years? Growth has
resumed since the Kosovo crisis in 1999, inflation has been l o w (except in Romania and SaM),
large inflows o f aid have been key to the recovery, as have the ability o f SEE countries t o
maintain macroeconomic stability and to sustain structural reforms. On the political front, all
countries have held elections since 1999. However, high unemployment, marginalization o f youth
and minorities, the spread o f organized crime, and trafficking in human beings remain severe
social challenges for the region. There has been considerable progress in the return and permanent
settlement o f refugees and IDPs; however, this continuing process also remains a challenge and
risk to SEE. The level o f post-war economic integration in SEE i s s t i l l rather l o w and risks of
political instability remain. As integration proceeds in the region, the level political r i s k will likely
decrease, while the economic risks will increase, as interdependencies rise again.

27. Regional cooperation has further advanced under the Stability Pact for South Eastern
Europe and the SAP. The Stability Pact was formed by more than 40 countries and
organizations at the initiative o f the EU after the Kosovo crisis. I t encourages SEE countries to
develop common perspectives in numerous social, political, and economic areas. The SAP also

highlights regional cooperation as an explicit objective. Partly as a result o f these initiatives, there
are now a number o f programs for the reconstruction and modernization o f trade and
infrastructure linkages within the region, including the Trade and Transport Facilitation Program
for SEE (TTFSE), the Memorandum o f Understanding on Trade Liberalization and Facilitation,
the Memorandum o f Understanding o f the Energy Community o f South Eastern Europe (ECSEE)
(“Athens Memorandum”), and the Sava Basin Initiative, together with a Regional Strategy for the
Transport Sector, currently under preparation. This CAS supports regional cooperation in a
number o f areas (see Annex 5), including BH’s participation in ECSEE.

D. Medium-Term Outlook and External Financing Requirements

28.

Given a scenario of satisfactory reforms, renewed and sustainable growth i s
achievable in the medium-term. The base case scenario assumes “satisfactory reform
performance” (see Table 2), which would address the medium-term macroeconomic challenge
faced by BH t o regain pre-war output levels by the end o f the decade, while moving from aid
dependency to fiscal self-reliance and external sustainability. While base case projections are
generally consistent with the orientation of the MTDS, they allow for a more ‘cautious
approach to the short-term impact o f structural reforms, particularly concerning saving rates.
Furthermore, they account for recent economic developments regarding credit growth and the
current account, assuming a monetary tightening in 2004 and continued fiscal consolidation.
This i s expected to result in somewhat more moderate growth rates over the CAS period,
albeit sufficient to yield notable increases in per capita GDP.

29. This base case scenario i s predicated upon the following assumptions: (i)continued
implementation o f the currency board; (ii)
continued efforts to consolidate public expenditure,
within feasible targets; (iii)
a tightening o f credit policy in 2004 leading to a reduction o f the
current account deficit and a slight slowdown o f growth in 2005; (iv) the acceleration o f structural
reforms, especially with respect to the business environment, privatization and the labor market,
gradually translating into higher private domestic savings; and (v) the absence o f a large external
shock. In addition, the share o f investments in GDP would remain roughly at the level observed in
the past few years, although the type o f investment would shift from reconstruction to more
productive investment. loEconomic growth, which would accelerate towards 5 percent (in real
terms) by 2007, would be driven mainly by new market entrants, foreign direct investment and
restructured domestic companies. As a corollary, market exit o f unviable companies would create
the necessary space for enterprise growth. The public sector contribution to growth would stem
from a gradual reduction in tax pressures o n the economy and a reallocation o f spending towards
w e l l targeted and selective infrastructure investment. Expenditure policies would also focus on
improving efficiency in the use o f resources to enhance the human capital base (secondary and
higher education). In the face o f steadily declining aid flows, BH will have to achieve an
adjustment o f i t s external imbalance in order to reduce external vulnerability and attract
commercial financing in the medium-term. Fiscal restraint and a decline in private consumption as
a share of GDP would improve the current account balance in the short-term, while improved
corporate performance would generate additional national private savings in the medium-term,
On the fiscal side, non-interest recurrent spending as a share o f GDP would decline from 42.1
percent in 2003, to 39.4 percent by 2006. Contributions to the projected increase in private
savings of about 1 percent o f GDP per year would be shared by the household sector (about onethird of a percent) and the corporate sector (about two-thirds o f a percent).

30. A s a high case for the Bank program, this CAS retains the medium-term
macroeconomic program envisioned in the M T D S , aiming at sustainable growth and grounded
in continued fiscal discipline to ensure policy consistency with the currency board arrangement,
similar to the base case. This “full reform performance” scenario foresees an acceleration o f real
GDP growth to 5.5 percent annually starting in 2004. Among other things, the scenario i s based
upon a strong turnaround in domestic savings. On the basis o f data made available after the
finalization o f the MTDS, the high case scenario retains a slightly different balance between
domestic private and public savings, which underpins the high case lending triggers (see paras.
123-4). Non-interest recurrent spending would be reduced to 38 percent o f GDP in 2006. Bank
lending in a high case would require demonstrated debt sustainability.
3 1. I n the case o f delayed reforms (in connection, for example, with 2006 national elections),
BH would move to slower growth and a more precarious macroeconomic situation. With
domestic savings rising more slowly than under the base case, the needed adjustment in the
current account balance would come through an actual phased decline in the ratio o f investments
to GDP. This trend, in combination with slower improvements in productivity, would reduce the
growth rate o f BH’s G D P and living standards. Exports and imports would both grow at slower
rates than projected under the base case, further contributing to the output decline. Financing in
the form o f FDI would also fail to materialize as needed, and aid flows would decline faster. The
resulting weakening o f the overall balance o f payments would squeeze the growth o f BH’s money
supply, presenting the country with heightened macroeconomic risks, exacerbating debt
management vulnerabilities to external and domestic shocks and placing greater pressure on the
lo

currency board arrangement. With few improvements in the fimctioning o f BHs labor markets,
the resulting deflationary squeeze would also result in further increases in unemployment rates.

32. Corresponding with the satisfactory macroeconomic scenario (Table 2) there i s a need
for sizeable external inflows to support BH’s balance o f payments. For the 2004-07 period,
the total financing requirement would average about US$ 1.7 billion annually (see Table 3),
stemming primarily from a large, albeit declining, recorded current account deficit. Forecasting
balance o f payments projections for BH, however, i s particularly challenging given sizeable nondebt creating private capital flows, which are believed to result in large part from unidentified
transfers, and to a lesser extent from a drawdown o n foreign exchange savings held abroad. In
total, these flows have averaged close to 11 percent o f GDP between 2000 and 2002. Such flows
will account for much o f the large errors and omissions category in past balance o f payments data
published by the IMF. In as much as they are indeed transfers, these inflows would need to be
recorded o n the current account, so that the actual current account gap m a y be less than shown in
the statistics. The fact that BH’s external debt to GDP ratio has declined, despite the widening o f
the recorded current account deficit, appears to confirm the hypothesis regarding large unrecorded
non-debt creating flows.

percent o f GDP between 1998 and 2003, but decline and amount t o an annual 3.1 percent o f GDP
between 2004 and 2007. Foreign direct investment (US$ 320 m i l l i o n o r 4.6 percent o f GDP in
2003) would increase to an average 6.2 percent o f GDP during the projection period (representing
average annual inflows worth US$ 535 million), partly because o f the acceleration in the strategic
privatization program which would include a number o f large transactions. Financing from
project-related loans would fluctuate between 1 and 1.5 percent o f GDP, slightly below the
historical average. As a result, a financing requirement o f US$362 million would emerge for
2004-07. Approximately 40 percent o f expected financing would be covered by IDA’S
adjustment support, both current lending (Le. EMSAC, SOSAC 11, and the remaining tranche o f
the BAC) and future lending (Le. the programmatic adjustment credits proposed in the base case
lending scenario). Other sources o f financing are expected to include disbursements under a new
IMF program and EU macro-financial assistance.

111. Medium-Term Economic and Social Reform Challenges
A. BH’s O w n Vision for the Future: The Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS)

34. T h e M T D S , BH’s poverty reduction strategy (PRSP), lays out three overarching
objectives to b e pursued in parallel during 2004-07: (a) create conditions for sustainable and
balanced economic development, and “restore partial creditworthiness” o n the international
capital markets; (b) reduce poverty by one-fifth; and (c) accelerate EU integration. Building
upon the Interim-PRSP (completed in December 200 1) and based o n the recognition that eventual
integration into the EU provides the overall institutional and legal framework for economic
development in BH, the M T D S emphasizes the strong interrelationship o f these objectives. It
acknowledges that the main challenge for social and economic development and poverty
reduction in the coming three years will be to make the transition from a largely aid-dependent
economy to one that i s dynamic and self-sustaining. T o meet this challenge, the strategy focuses
o n promoting private sector growth by reforming the public sector and establishing conditions
conducive t o private investment while strengthening the social protection system, thereby
improving employment opportunities, including for women and youth, and the livelihoods o f the
working poor.
35. A central theme o f the M T D S i s that sustained growth requires improving the
competitiveness o f the economy. D u e t o the war and reconstruction, BH has lost more than a
decade in terms o f transition reforms compared t o other ECA countries. Furthermore, the M T D S
recognizes that the currency board, t o w h i c h the MTDS reconfirms BH’s commitment, imposes a
hard economic discipline, because factor costs directly affect the country’s competitiveness in
external markets. In this regard, the large recorded current account deficit constitutes the greatest
remaining macroeconomic imbalance for BH. At the same time, domestic public and private
savings must be further increased to enable growth in investments. T o address these issues, the
M T D S calls for a swift and mutually reinforcing combination o f public finance reforms and
improvements in the business environment, strengthened corporate governance, and corporate
restructuring. T o meet the M T D S growth targets o f 5 to 6 percent per year, while ensuring social
stability and sustainability, the M T D S also acknowledges that BH must make significant
investments in i t s social and economic infrastructure, especially in health, education, and basic
infrastructure. Moreover, the M T D S emphasizes further trade liberalization, including tariff
reduction, as a necessary step t o deeper integration with other SEE economies and WTO
accession.

36.

T o achieve these goals the strategy identifies the following general priorities:

>

Maintaining macroeconomic stability, while achieving sustained higher growth rates
and a significantly reduced current account deficit. T o achieve this, the authorities w o u l d
follow prudent macroeconomic management by using policy levers under their control
including the maintenance o f the currency board arrangement and strict control over credit
policies in order to anchor price stability, as well as fiscal consolidation that would further
contribute to increase domestic savings (see below). Given this policy mix, and barring
the occurrence o f exogenous shocks, several k e y assumptions underpin the M T D S reform
scenario: (a) growth will recover from 3.5 percent in 2003 to 5 percent in 2004, and reach
5.5 percent in 2007; (b) the investment rate will remain high, averaging a little over 20
percent o f GDP per year, financed by a significant increase in private savings; (c) strong
gains in foreign direct investment (up t o 9 percent o f GDP by 2007) would offset
12

declining a i d flows; and (d) the growth in exports would average 14 percent per year, with
import growth constrained to about 6 percent per year. As a result, a positive adjustment
of more than 6 percentage points in the current account deficit i s projected.

P Promoting private sector development, with an emphasis o n support for increased

entrepreneurship, accelerated privatization, and the establishment o f a business
environment more attractive to private foreign investment. Efforts are planned to further
reduce bamers to business entry; remove internal barriers t o trade and commerce, thereby
creating a “single economic space” in BH; improve the judicial system; reduce corruption;
simplify the tax system; and improve infrastructure. The M T D S privatization strategy
focuses o n a reclassification o f enterprises by their readiness for privatization, and o n
developing a comprehensive strategy for debt resolution o f these enterprises, while
recognizing the importance o f addressing the social costs o f restructuring within the
overall strategy. I t also calls for accelerated privatization in the power,
telecommunications, railway, water management, forestry, and media sectors.
Furthermore, the M T D S acknowledges that containing wage taxes i s a prerequisite for
achieving greater flexibility in the labor market and limiting “unfair” competition from the
informal economy. I t also calls for a more robust role for foreign banks and more lending
to firms.

P Strengthening fiscal reform to increase expenditure efficiency and free resources for

private sector development. Aiming to contain the current account deficit, the M T D S
fiscal reform program focuses on: (a) reducing public expenditures, recognizing that the
level o f public expenditure at above 50 percent o f G D P i s s t i l l too high; and (b) achieving
greater stability through fiscal consolidation, including containing public wages, and more
efficient mechanisms for: (i)
public revenue collection; (ii)the allocation o f public
revenues between different levels o f government; and (iii)the rationalization o f
expenditures for health, social transfers, education, defense, and police. The M T D S also
identifies a clear plan for resolving the large internal debt problem, and establishing a
modern c i v i l service.

37. Other general priorities include anticorruption measures focused o n further reform o f the
judiciary, and forthcoming public administration reforms, including procurement. Sector
priorities include education system reform; strengthening primary health care by expanding the
family medicine model; liberalization o f the electric power, postal, and telecommunications
markets; and greater support for commercial agriculture. In addition, strengthening the country’s
statistics system i s recognized as essential t o the success o f the overall reform process.

3 8. The MTDS reflects extensive stakeholder consultation and participation, inferring
broad-based ownership. A Coordination Board, chaired by the BH Prime Minister and
comprising the state-level Council o f Ministers, Entity Prime Ministers, and Ministers o f Finance,

was formed expressly to oversee the preparation o f the M T D S . For the first time, it provided a
forum and innovative process through which all three governments o f BH could meet o n a regular
basis. Inter-ministerial working groups were established, involving local academicians, to support
preparation o f the strategy. The active engagement o f a broad array o f stakeholders, including
c i v i l society, private sector representatives, academia, media, foreign investors, and international
organizations, gave weight and credibility to the participatory process. Indeed, the consensusbuilding dialogue among a l l segments o f BH society, until recently divided by conflict, i s a
significant achievement enabling the formulation and initial implementation o f the country’s firstever homegrown economic development strategy.
13

39. T h e M T D S i s rooted in a clear, analytically based poverty profile. The strategy
highlights that, while there i s no more extreme poverty in BH, one-fifth o f the population (19.5
percent) lives below the poverty line (25 percent in the RS and 16 percent in the FBH). An
additional 30 percent o f the population lives close to the poverty line and i s vulnerable to falling
below the line with small declines in income. Adding non-income dimensions o f poverty
(education, health, housing, and human rights), a staggering 72 percent o f adults are poor in at
least one dimension of well-being, and vulnerability levels (that is, the risk o f falling into poverty)
are also high. The M T D S poverty profile, which i s consistent with Bank analysis”, shows
significant regional disparities in poverty largely centered o n rural and small semi-urban
communities that were most adversely affected by conflict (see also Annex 6). Children
(particularly those under 5 years of age), women, displaced persons and returnees, persons with
l o w levels o f education, and the unemployed appear to be at particular risk. However, while
unemployment i s an important determinant o f poverty, about 60 percent o f the poor are living in
families where someone i s employed, and as such are “the working poor.”
40. T h e M T D S recognizes that the cause o f poverty i s multifaceted, and includes war
destruction, slow implementation of reforms, unemployment, human rights violations, an
inadequate social protection system, l o w quality o f education, corruption, and the inability o f the
poor to influence state institutions. I t acknowledges that poverty in BH i s more widespread than in
any other country o f the former Socialist Federative Republic o f Yugoslavia (SFRY).
Furthermore, i t notes that improvements since the war are largely the result o f extensive
international donor assistance. Going forward, therefore, the M T D S projects that it will be
imperative t o sustain an average annual economic growth rate o f 5 to 6 percent to reduce poverty
further.

41. The M T D S anticipates the following multidimensional policy measures in order to
reduce the level o f poverty b y 20 percent by 2007: (a) fiscal reform to ensure more effective
collection of public revenues and higher assistance to the poor, (b) private sector development to
increase employment, (c) more adequate systems o f social protection, (d) reduced corruption, (e)
reduction in the size o f the informal economy, (0 guarantee human rights leading to better
integration o f returnee and Roma populations, (g) implementing the L a w o n Gender Equality, and
(h) reform o f the education system.
42. Although the M T D S i s an impressive strategy for developing and implementing
countrywide economic growth and poverty reduction policies, there are aspects that need
reinforcement.12 Demonstrating BH’s increasing ownership o f its economic future, the M T D S
provides a remarkable first step in defining an overall development strategy, which will need to be
improved and prioritized as i t i s implemented. The participatory process itself has brought about
an unprecedented degree of coordination and dialogue among governments, and between the
government and civil society. Furthermore, the M T D S identifies a program for strengthening
statistical systems and monitoring and evaluation, outlining a role for parliaments and c i v i l society
in this process. Implementation o f the M T D S will center o n creating and operationalizing the
Economic Policy and Planning Unit (EPPU) in the office o f the State Prime Minister, balancing
program monitoring, and strengthened research capacities to support policymaking. The
responsibilities o f the EPPU will include the preparation o f the annual progress report, foreseen as

the basis for future policy adjustments. Nonetheless, several areas o f the strategy require
improvement, including: better linkages among the strategy, the MTEFs, Public Investment
Programs (PIP) and the Entity annual budgets; a more prioritized action plan o f policy and
legislative interventions; and an improved set o f monitoring indicators, related to both overall
objectives and inputs that can be controlled by Government.

B. I m p r o v i n g Public Finance and Strengthening Institutions
43. The reform of public finance i s a priority for BH, and must be seen as a corollary o f
reforms in the private sector. There are four key challenges in the area o f public finance: (a) the
size and scope o f public expenditure as a share o f GDP i s s t i l l too large and crowds out private
sector activity in the economy; (b) the composition o f public expenditure i s suboptimal and needs
to be corrected; (c) the management o f public resources needs to be improved to increase
efficiency, transparency, and accountability; and (d) the fiscal architecture, based o n BH’s highly
decentralized constitution, needs reform. In essence, the fiscal reform program can be described as
“doing better with less”, an evolving, but feasible agenda. Opportunities for savings exist, and the
m a i n issue will be to reallocate them in the most efficient way. In some sectors, the agenda i s
clearly l a i d out (e.g. education, social protection), while more analytical work i s needed in others
(e.g., health).

44. The ratio of consolidated public expenditure to GDP o f 54 percent reflects the
multilayer, highly decentralized government structure created b y the DPA. This structure i s
overly burdensome to the economy and hampers the authorities’ efforts to increase
competitiveness. Achieving rationalization o n the expenditure side requires decreasing the
prohibitive burden imposed by taxes and contributions that cut across layers o f government.
Additional expenditure pressure points can also be expected to arise in coming years, such as
public sector downsizing costs, the costs o f social mitigation measures to accompany corporate
restructuring, implementation o f the domestic claims settlement plan, and further institutional
strengthening o f the State in the process o f EU accession.
45. Several spending categories stand out as prime candidates for current expenditure
rationalization. Foremost, wages and salaries absorb an excessive share o f total on-budget
expenditure (33 percent) and render the total public sector wage bill unaffordable and financially
unsustainable. In FBH, public sector employees make up about 20 percent o f the formal sector
workforce, and the wage bill represents close to 30 percent o f total public spending and 16 percent
of GDP. In Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, by comparison, the average wage bill
amounts to 17 percent o f total public spending and 7 percent o f GDP. Instituting an effective
constraining cap on the wage bill, therefore, i s a priority reform. Furthermore, the current wage
determination system i s overly complex and unevenly implemented, leaving insufficient r o o m to
reward gradations in performance or levels o f responsibility. T o modernize the wage system, the
process o f institutional and administrative reforms, already approved in principle by the
authorities, now needs to be accelerated with the support o f the Bank’s EMSAC and the EC’s
Public Administration Reform (PAR) program. Further rationalization and reorientation o f such
high expenditure areas as education, health, and social protection (including pensions) should also
be undertaken to reduce fragmentation and inefficiency and to improve equity. While significant
downsizing o f the military (4.3 percent o f GDP in 2002) and corresponding expenditures has
already been achieved, a further reduction in non-productive spending, as foreseen in the MTDS,
will be necessary, including a more complete rationalization o f police services (spending o n l a w
and order account for 4.2 percent o f GDP), building o n ongoing efforts. Reforming expenditure
15

o n social protection will be largely self-financed as gains from the war veterans transfers will be
reallocated to poverty targeted benefits.

46. H i g h public wage bills crowd out necessary expenditures in operations and
maintenance (O&M) and priority investments. Compared to the wage bill, outlays for O&M
in BH are disproportionately l o w and inadequate, leading to degradation in asset quality and
value, particularly in key areas o f infrastructure. For example, the level o f unaccounted publicly
supplied water in BH i s in excess of 55 percent on average (against a benchmark o f 15 to 30
percent in comparable countries). Regional and local roads (80 percent o f the road network) are
in bad condition. Striking a better balance among wages and O&M, within an overall shrinking
public expenditure envelope as a share o f GDP, i s therefore an urgent priority within the broader
reform agenda. Although, the M T D S supports this objective, the challenge for the authorities
n o w i s to more concretely link Public Investment Plans (PIP) and MTEFs to the various sector
strategies spelled out in the MTDS.
47. Public resources management needs to be strengthened b y improving technical
efficiency, accountability, and transparency. As acknowledged in the MTDS, a main challenge
lies in strengthening budget preparation, execution and reporting, accountability, and
transparency, and the overall integrity o f public resources management. Budget preparation
suffers from weaknesses both in terms o f medium-term planning and annual budgeting, and
chronic non-compliance with the budgetary calendar at the sub-Entity levels. With the support of
technical assistance provided under the Bank’s Second Public and Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (PFSAC 11, n o w closed), both Entities engaged in 1999-2000 in the formulation of
MTEFs. The process was not sustained, however, given domestic capacity constraints. In 2003,
the Entities relaunched the medium-term programming process by preparing and then adopting
comprehensive MTEFs for 2004-06. Nonetheless, in both Entities, and at the cantonal level,
institutionalization of the MTEF preparation and implementation process, and i t s links with the
annual budget preparation system, needs to be strengthened. For the Entities, this means
improved cooperation with line ministries, where budgeting capacity i s generally weak. At the
state-level, where there i s s t i l l n o legal framework to guide budget preparation, drafting o f an
organic budget law, while started, needs to be completed. Moreover, recent analysis underlines
the need to show even more decisive action in implementing good governance measures, in order
to prevent negative impacts o n investor confidence and to ensure the effective use o f public
resources. These reforms are being supported by the Bank’s E M S A C .
48. Ongoing efforts to establish an adequate fiduciary framework for government
financial management need to be advanced. While a single treasury ledger account was
introduced at both the State and Entity levels, a wider financial management reform agenda
remains. An internal audit l a w needs to be drafted and adopted, and a review of the existing
control systems completed. With respect to the external audit function, as a first step, the existing
Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) laws will need to be amended to achieve greater harmonization,
enhanced independence, and increased clarity o f mandates among counterparts (Parliaments,
Governments, and so forth). Improved public procurement and conflict-of-interest legislation,
and enforcement at the State and Entity levels, are also necessary to reduce the scope of
corruption . and influence peddling. This ought to include strengthening procedures and
administrative controls, standardizing bidding documents, and enforcing transparency
requirements. The ongoing E M S A C supports these reforms. Furthermore, the authorities need to
present a united front to establish the legitimacy o f conflict-of-interest regulation.

16

49. Intergovernmental fiscal policy in BH requires substantial strengthening. The BH
constitution leads to a complex administrative structure o f government where key state functions
(e.g. security and fiscal oversight) are performed by sub-national governments. Most taxation
powers and decisions o n public service delivery are retained by the Entities, while the operations
of the State (at the top) and o f municipalities (at the bottom) are essentially financed by either
vertical transfers or shared taxes. The main challenges to strengthening the intergovernmental
fiscal architecture in BH include: (a) insufficient fiscal policy coordination among the various
levels of government, due to the absence o f vertical and horizontal cooperation among sub-statelevel governments; (b) lack o f hard budget constraints at the sub-entity level, due to widespread
off-budget operations; (c) unfunded mandates, due to ill-defined expenditure assignments across
levels of government, leading to inefficiencies by duplication and under provision for essential
public services; and (d) vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances, due to mismatches between
expenditure responsibilities and local revenue capacities, which increase regional inequities and
allocative inefficiencies. T o address these issues, fiscal policy reform must include improvements
in: intergovernmental fiscal policy coordination; budgetary discipline across a l l levels o f
government; expenditure and revenue assignments; and the intergovernmental transfer system. So
far, there i s n o single institutional anchor in BH coordinating follow-through o n these important
issues, although the establishment o f a new joint (State and Entities) institution for fiscal policy
coordination i s foreseen under the EMSAC. The establishment o f the Indirect Tax Authority
(ITA) i s also crucial to bring about wide-ranging administrative changes and an adequate
financing mechanism for the State, as well as State level accountability for macro analysis and
monitoring o f consolidated fiscal developments. T o best rationalize intergovernmental fiscal
relations, the operations o f the ITA, EPPU, and planned fiscal policy coordination agency will
need to be closely coordinated by the authorities.

C. Promoting Sustainable Private Sector L e d Growth
50. The challenge for BH in the coming years will be to make the transition from a largely
aid-dependent economy to self-sustaining, private-sector-led growth. Creating an exportfriendly environment and attracting foreign direct investment will be o f particular importance in
view o f the large trade and current account deficits. The experience with privatization in BH has
been disappointing, and the overall business environment i s not yet conducive to the levels of
private investment needed to sustain the growth rates set out in the MTDS. The authorities will
need to recommit themselves to these objectives, and BH will need assistance from i t s
international partners in tackling corporate governance and restructuring challenges. The latter
m a y be the most important, but also the most challenging, reform for BH’s economy in the
coming years. In addition, labor market reforms will need to be undertaken to tackle high levels
of unemployment, and to support private sector growth.
51. Despite progress in recent years and much international support, the business
environment in BH i s not yet investor friendly enough. While i t costs 23.6 percent o f per
capita income on average to start a business in ECA countries, and 18.2 percent in neighboring
Croatia, the cost i s more than double (5 1.8 percent) in BH. Also, enforcing a contract costs 2 1.3
percent in BH compared with 6.6 percent in Croatia and 3.6 percent in Slovenia. This puts BHbased companies at a large di~advantage.’~BH i s also one o f the highest-taxed economies in
CEE. The tax burden and the complexity o f the tax system (the “nuisance factor”) crowd out the
private sector, pushing entrepreneurs into the already large informal economy (estimates range up
l3
“Doing Business in 2004, A Project Benchmarking the Regulatory Costs o f Doing Business in over 130
Countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Profile,” World Bank Group.

17

to 40 percent o f GDP), and creating incentives for generalized tax evasion. Business entry i s
complicated by a multitude o f unnecessary and sometimes overlapping regulations. The
inspections regime i s burdensome and prone to non-transparent practices. The trends in
corruption levels in BH are disconcerting: a recent Bank report14 shows that corruption and state
capture s t i l l rank among the top five obstacles t o doing business by f i r m s operating in BH, and
trends seem t o b e worsening.
52. T h e main challenges for the business environment are threefold: (a) to facilitate
business entry through a simplified and transparent countrywide business registration and
licensing system; (b) to streamline the environment for business operation by reducing company
compliance and operating costs (rationalization o f inspections and regulations, simplification o f
the tax regime, lowering the tax and contributions burden, creating alternative dispute settlement
mechanisms, and providing equal access to procurement); and (c) to ease business exit through
strengthened bankruptcy and liquidation systems. Some progress has been made, with support
from the Bank’s Business Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC), with respect to smoother
business exits, such as bankruptcy laws having recently been adopted in b o t h Entities-but
progress i s slower than anticipated. Although the banking sector i s more robust and able to
accommodate h t u r e growth in the real sector, the reform agenda i s not complete: some
comparatively smaller mergers and consolidations are ongoing, and non-banking financial
services need t o be further developed.

Progress with
53. T h e M T D S emphasizes the need to accelerate privatization.
privatization has been lagging behind desired timetables and outcomes in BH. N i n e years
after the DPA, large SOEs s t i l l dominate the formal economy. According t o the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Transition Report 2003, out o f 27 transition
countries, BH belongs to the lowest-performing five in the area o f small and large-scale
privatization. In 1999 the government adopted, with donor advice, a voucher (“mass”)
privatization program, which has resulted in large numbers o f privatized SMEs (approximately 65
percent in FBH and 53 percent in the RS). However, the voucher program has resulted in diluted
ownership without introducing new management o r new capital investment. In a second stage,
privatizations based o n international competitive tenders have also gone slowly. Only a few o f
the targeted large (“strategic”) SOEs have so far been successfully sold to private investors (32
percent o f large SOEs in the FBH and 22 percent in the RS, corresponding, respectively, t o 6.8
percent o f total capital o f large SOEs in the FBH and 19 percent in the RS). As a result, SOEs
s t i l l constitute a great share of the economy, and this remains a major obstacle to competitiveness.
M a n y privatized f i r m s do not seek profits, loss making i s widespread, and workers tolerate wage
arrears so that many f i r m s are unsustainably indebted both t o the tax authorities and t o their
workers. The privatization process i s overshadowed by political and social concerns over possible
workforce reductions, vested interests, and rivalries over future ownership. The demonstrated
political commitment has been m i x e d at best.
54. The main challenge, therefore, i s to institutionalize a wide-reaching program that
would: (a) resolve the burdens o f excess indebtedness and overcapacity that plague potentially
viable parts o f enterprises whose recapitalization hinges o n improvements in corporate
governance and competitiveness t o b e delivered by strategic investors f r o m the private sector; (b)
scale-up a streamlined bankruptcy and liquidation process for releasing enterprise assets into
productive use and liberating capital for additional deployment in other uses; (c) provide relief

from social pressures stemming from any adverse side-effects o f large scale revitalization of
enterprises; and (d) remove distortions in regulatory functions and stakeholder governance o f
voucher privatized firms, market fueling competition and productivity improvements and hence
sustainable economic growth. Public campaigns to elicit support for reforms strengthening the
platform for revitalization o f the private sector, both through organic (internally generated)
growth as w e l l as divestiture o f state ownership capital, will notably feature the growing positive
role by c i v i l society in shaping opinion o f the reform process and in examining the approaches to
privatization that are salient to the BH economy given the current international investment
realities. Hence, the definition o f pragmatic, fiscally and financially sustainable reforms o f the
privatization, liquidation, and social insurance systems are n o w essential. In the area o f large
utilities (power, telecommunication, railway, water, and so forth) privatization, also foreseen in
the MTDS, will require favorable investment environments in the respective sectors, and proper
legal and regulatory frameworks, addressing issues o f corporate governance, t a r i f f reform, and
restructuring of these enterprises prior to privatization.

55. A further key constraint to economic growth i s labor market rigidities. BH’s
unemployment figures are highly problematic: ~ n e m p l o y m e n t ‘ ~stands between 16 and 25
percent; the labor force participation rate i s among the lowest in the region (with 48.5 percent o f
the working-age population aged 15 t o 64); youth unemployment i s high (45.6 percent for people
aged 15 to 19, and 33.6 percent o f people aged 20 t o 24); and women represent only about onethird (34.2 percent) o f the total labor force. A number o f reasons explain this problem. First,
first-time j o b seekers have tremendous problems accessing jobs, and when they do, these jobs are
in the large informal sector, which provides about one-third o f total employment. This reflects
both the l o w rate o f absolute j o b creation, and hence problems in the wider business environment,
and the successful attachment o f the employed to their jobs (the average age o f formal workers i s
40). Furthermore, taxes o n wages (including social security and health care) dramatically raise
the cost of labor (by 69 percent in FBH and 52 percent in RS), resulting in a substantial growth of
the informal economy. Wage-bargaining mechanisms are notoriously rigid, contributing to l o w
j o b creation and l o w worker mobility, and a highly compressed wage structure that bears n o
parallel with changes in productivity. In addition, the Employment Institutes (EIs), charged with
the implementation o f active and passive labor market policies, have in the past suffered from
poor business practices, lax financial management, and variable levels o f service among Entities
and within cantons. Their practice o f issuing soft credits to f i r m s has also proved ineffective in
increasing the demand for labor. The overall challenge i s therefore t o improve demand for labor
through: (a) an improved business environment; (b) reduction o f taxes o n labor; (c) a fundamental
reform of the wage-setting mechanism, providing for broad social compacts while allowing
decentralization to firm-level bargaining; and (d) reforming the EIs to provide more cost-effective
active and passive labor market support.
56. Overall, achieving economic growth will require a combination of significant private
and public sector reforms, as well as targeted investments. T o achieve a higher growth
trajectory, the authorities will have to more vigorously address the dual challenge o f reducing the
excessively high share o f public expenditure to GDP (currently at 54 percent), t o create space for
private sector growth, and to improve the investment climate. Given the experience in other
transition countries, short-term growth and n e w employment will most l i k e l y come from S M E
l5
According to the “Labor Force Survey 2001”; and “Labor Market in Postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina, How to
encourage Businesses to Create Jobs and Increase Worker Mobility,” World Bank, 2002. Robust data on
employment in BH are not readily available; therefore, all numbers must be treated with caution.

19

growth, while the benefits o f privatization will materialize in the medium-term. Hence, a p o l i c y
focus o n n e w entries o f f i r m s coupled with privatization will b e needed.

D. Investing in K e y Social and Economic Infrastructure
57. Targeted investments are necessary to complement public finance reform and to
enable private-sector-led growth. Further reforms and investments in k e y social and economic
infrastructure will b e key to maintaining social stability in parallel with both public and private
sector reforms. Providing a l l citizens with opportunities for sharing in the country’s economic
growth and improving their social condition will b e essential to solidifylng popular support for the
difficult transition reforms which l i e ahead. Improving access to basic services and infrastructure
i s also a k e y ingredient to a successfd program o f poverty alleviation, a central tenet o f the
M T D S . As part o f the sustainable growth equation, therefore, medium-term priorities include: (a)
social protection, including pensions; (b) education; (c) health; (d) infrastructure, energy, and
water management; and (e) agriculture, forestry, and the environment.
58. Education. The M T D S acknowledges that despite relatively high levels o f expenditure (as
a share of GDP), both the education and the health sectors are characterized by inequitable access
t o quality services. This i s a particular problem for the poor in BH, where about 60 percent l i v e in
households in which the head o f the family has o n l y primary education. Overall, the share of
education spending in GDP in BH i s significantly higher than in other CEE countries and in EU
countries (that is, about twice the level o f Western Europe). Moreover, the lion’s share of
budgetary expenditure i s spent o n wages and salaries, with only a residual allocated to operations
and maintenance. Reflecting a mixture o f systems inherited f r o m the pre-war Yugoslavia and a
highly decentralized policy and institutional framework established after the war, BH’s
fragmented education system i s hardly functional, and i s characterized by high unit costs,
mounting arrears, poor outcomes, and highly inequitable service provision.
Operating
inefficiencies are particularly striking at the secondary and tertiary levels, where unit costs are
high and completion rates low. M a j o r reforms, w h i c h heretofore have been hampered by
nationalist interests (see B o x 2), therefore, are aimed at these two levels, which are o f particular
relevance in the creation o f human capital needed for economic growth and eventual European
accession. Despite high spending levels, preschool education i s unavailable t o the poor,
enrollment rates are dramatically low, except at the primary level, and the present system remains
weak in serving minorities, who are commonly taught in separate schools. At the tertiary level,
higher education i s generally organized around individual faculties, which, unlike universities,
have legal and financial autonomy, leaving them o n l y loosely accountable for the quality o f their
services and for their financial management, w h i c h remains non-transparent. Additionally, in
FBH the financing i s organized by cantons, which i s another source o f inefficiency. Oversight
and financing o f tertiary education will therefore need to be assigned either t o the Entity o r the
State level in order t o improve the management o f the system and educational outcomes.
59. Health. Although important reforms in the health sector have taken place and are ongoing,
deeper reforms are needed t o ensure the financial sustainability o f the system and to overcome
prevailing weaknesses in the efficiency, equity, and quality o f health services (see para. 56).
Recorded health spending in BH i s exceptionally high at nearly 13 percent o f G D P ( o f w h i c h
about 5 percent i s out o f pocket expenditures), compared to b o t h Western European countries
(about 8 percent for public expenditures) and CEE transition countries (4 percent). This stems
from BH’s history and current fragmented administrative structures, allocative inefficiencies and
weak institutional capacity. Despite a restoration o f infrastructure during the reconstruction
period, the basic outline of the health care system remains unchanged. Access to care i s
20

increasingly uneven and focused o n curative care while primary care remains underdeveloped.
Outside the p i l o t sites supported by the recently completed Bank-financed Basic Health Project,
primary health care (PHC) plays an insufficient role in prevention o r diagnosis and treatment.
Box 2: Political Economy of Reform in B H The Examples of Veterans’ Benefits and Higher Education
Recent experience with veterans’ benefits and higher education reforms exemplifies the extent to which powerful
interest groups, nationalist agendas, and ‘ethnic’ tensions continue to shape the economic and social reform landscape.
I t also shows that, while not a guarantee for success, a persistent approach to providing timely technical input and
intensive support for the champions o f reform, is essential to progress.
Reforming the system o f cash benefits for war veterans is a particular challenge for a country emerging from violent
conflict. In BH, where nine years after the war emotions still run high conceming veterans’ benefits, the issue features
prominently on the political agendas. In contrast to other beneficiaries o f a reoriented social transfer system, veterans
are effectively represented by their associations, and governments are obliged t o consult closely with them on changes
to the entitlement system. An important first step in the reform process-Entity legislation limiting and bettertargeting entitlements and requiring that related budgetary obligations not exceed available resources-was drafted
over a three-year period with Bank support. However, it was met with strong resistance from veterans across the
country. In FBH this resistance was fueled by the introduction of an unpopular merger o f the separate Croat and
Bosniak war veterans benefit systems and administrations. In the RS, negotiations between veterans associations and
the government oscillated between constructive working group engagement and street protests. The recent adoption o f
the Veterans Benefits Laws by the Entities (a core condition o f SOSAC II), therefore, represents the first serious
milestone in the reform process since the war’s end. Leading up to this, intensive negotiations and mediation,
coordinated among major stakeholders by the Bank and the OHR, helped broker a complex arrangement agreeable to
all parties.
The political difficulty o f reforming veterans’ benefits i s easily rivaled by the reform o f higher education. Moving
away from fragmented institutional and financing structures, the reform process centers on enhancing quality and
promoting greater efficiency in the sector. T h i s entails funding for higher education at the Entity level, giving
corporate universities legal status, abolishing the separate legal identity o f faculties, and assisting universities in
restructuring in line with requirements o f the European Higher Education Area. Following an extensive consultative
process, focused on the proposed Education Restructuring Project, govemments and stakeholders agreed on
fundamental reform o f the financing and management o f higher education. T h i s reform package was eventually
endorsed by all Ministers o f Education and govemments at the State, Entity, and cantonal levels through the MTDS
approval process and other widely publicized policy statements. It eventually encountered a deadlock in the legislative
process, however, with parliamentarians divided largely along ‘ethnic’ lines; with Croats arguing for funding to be
placed at the State level and the predominately Serb RS Govemment arguing for i t t o be at the Entity level.
Ultimately, n o workable compromise could be reached, despite intensive advocacy and mediation on the part of the
Bank and its partners. Croat parliamentarians declared the draft State Framework Law in violation of their “vital
national interests,” leaving i t to the Constitutional Court to rule on this issue.
Looking ahead, sustaining progress in priority areas of reform -including those discussed above, as well as enterprise
revitalization and public finance rationalization and consolidation-will require the continuation of a persistent and
consultative approach within a unified framework o f donor conditionality and assistance.

60. Although BH’s health insurance schemes are meant to provide universal coverage and
access to health services, high unemployment, a large informal sector, and tax evasion have left
the health insurance system under-funded and a significant share o f the population uncovered (17
percent o f the population in the FBH and 35 percent in the RS). At the policy level, the capacity
of the multiple health ministries and health insurance funds remains limited. The current
organizational model with thirteen health systems in BH (one each in the FBH, the RS and in
Brcko District as well as one in each o f the ten FBH cantons) results in a highly fragmented
system in which duplication, lack o f economies o f scale, limited accountability and inadequate
risk pooling further exacerbate systemic inefficiencies, which have traditionally afflicted the
health care systems o f transition economies.

21

6 1. Over the past several years, both Entities have initiated wide-ranging reforms aimed at
addressing sector needs, including: (i)
development o f a family medicine (FM) delivery model,
(ii)introduction o f solidarity funds, (iii)
establishment o f cantonal health insurance funds, (iv)
introduction o f a new contracting and payment mechanism in pilot areas, and (v) inter-Entity and
intra-Federation cooperation. Nonetheless, serious problems persist. Priorities in the mediumt e r m include: (i)
improving the efficiency o f service delivery through an optimal mix of primary,
secondary, and tertiary levels of care and facilities, materials and equipment, and evidence-based
medical protocols; (ii)
improving access to health care; (iii)
strengthening institutional capacity
and mitigating the adverse effects o f administrative fragmentation; and (iv) increasing financial
stability.
62. Social protection in BH i s at a critical juncture. Intermittent progress has been achieved
o n first-generation reforms, such as controlling the fiscal costs o f cash benefits, including veterans
(see B o x 2), pensions and unemployment benefits, cushioning the impact o f military and
enterprise restructuring through labor redeployment and employment services, and resolving
Entity payment responsibilities. However, targeted interventions will be needed to advance
within the next critical stage o f systemic reforms. With a view to reorienting social protection
toward programs that protect the poorest in a fiscally sustainable manner, a consensus has
emerged within government and beyond on the medium-term priorities for reform. As outlined in
the MTDS, these include:
0

0

Overhauling veterans’ benefits legislation to rationalize spending f r o m the current 4 to 5
percent o f GDP and focusing o n the most disabled and needy;
Reforming employment services to focus on cost-effective and transparent job brokerage
and employment services, improving the reliability o f unemployment data (registered
Unemployment i s currently at 40 percent, while actual unemployment i s estimated at
between 16 and 25 percent);
Reorienting social welfare benefits and programs to achieve greater equity and inclusion,
while ensuring financial sustainability;
Basing future social policy development o n comprehensive poverty information (for
example, household surveys);
Strengthening the partnership between the public sector and c i v i l society in the design and
implementation o f reforms, with this and the above mentioned reforms supported by the
ongoing SOSAC 11; and
M o v i n g from a cash-rationed pension system, to an underlying structure o f entitlements,
including on disability and survivor pensions that provides affordable and sustainable
protection), and increasing inter-Entity cooperation as supported by the Bank’s SITAP.

63. While the pension funds have already undergone significant reform, a number of
outstanding systemic issues remain. Pension funds have been significantly reformed with
support from several Bank operations (PFSAC, PFSAC 11, Social Sector Technical Assistance
Credit, SOSAC 11) with resulting improvements in financial sustainability and predictability.
Future reforms are focused on expanding coverage to the uninsured o r partially insured (such as
farmers), and to placing the system o n a more sustainable footing. Reform o f the public pension
schemes will need to emphasize:
0

Ensuring fiscal balance, including the design and implementation o f mechanisms for
addressing issues relating to arrears, compliance, and collection;

22

0

0

0

0

Developing a strategy for resolving inter-Entitypensions, including further parametric and
structural reforms;
Reviewing possible extension o f coverage to protect the uninsured population against the
risks o f remaining in or falling into poverty (especially farmers w h o have been
traditionally omitted from the system);
Improving contribution collections by making the frequency o f personalized declarations
coincide with contribution payments; improving the legal, institutional, and technical
framework for controlling contribution payments and ensuring the effective operation o f
the unified revenue collection mode, eliminating parallelism in the control and
enforcement o f contributions; and
Beginning to identify longer-term reform options in the wake o f ongoing structural
reforms. W o r k i s needed to explore long-term policy options following the parametric and
structural reforms, including a notional defined contribution regime and a system o f
voluntary fknded pension instruments.

64. Agriculture, forestry, and the environment. H a l f o f BH’s population lives in rural or
semi-urban areas, and the incidence o f poverty i s generally higher in rural areas and small towns
than in urban areas. While some out-migration i s likely t o continue, sustainable economic growth
in BH will also depend o n the development o f a vibrant economy in these relatively povertystricken areas. Therefore, rural growth also plays a significant role in the poverty reduction
agenda. Within rural and semi-urban areas, there are three likely “sources o f growth”: (a) the
sustainable development o f wood-based industries; (b) improved agricultural competitiveness, and
(c) development o f the non-farm rural economy. Ongoing institutional and regulatory reforms in
the forestry sector are needed, however, t o maximize opportunities for growth. In BH, where
forests cover 45 percent o f the country, and 80 percent o f forests are public, the implementation o f
a new legislative framework in both Entities needs t o b e completed in order to strengthen public
institutions and governance for improved forest management, and increase forest sector revenues.
The privatization o f forest operations also needs t o b e supported through ongoing efforts t o
separate economic and administrative fbnctions in the sector. BH has the potential to compete
both in the local and export markets with a variety o f other agricultural products as well, including
horticultural, livestock, and dairy products. The creation o f a n enabling environment for privatesector-led growth in agriculture and agroindustry i s therefore key. Improving the competitiveness
of agriculture by supporting productivity improvements at the farm level (through access to
improved technology, irrigation, and micro-credit), and the development o f marketing chains and
their ability to meet EU requirements for food quality and safety, are central challenges for the
coming years. It i s expected that rural and semi-urban areas will also benefit f r o m the
implementation o f public sector reforms and improvements in the investment climate, as w e l l as
employment-generating and job-placement initiatives.
65. The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) represents BH consensus on
environmental priorities. Completed in 2003 by the authorities with broad stakeholder
engagement and Bank support, the NEAP establishes the principles o f environmentally
sustainable development as the basis for future natural resources management in BH. With the
inception o f the NEAP in 2000, measures aimed at environmental capacity building and
institutional strengthening have been introduced, including the harmonization o f environmental
assessment systems and legislation among the Entities and with the EU. Looking ahead, the
M T D S indicates medium-term priority areas, which include water resource and wastewater
management, sustainable development o f rural areas, improved environmental management tools,
biodiversity conservation, solid waste management, and sustainable economic development.
23

Furthermore, it acknowledges that improved water resources management, focused o n sustainable
practices, i s essential for sustainable growth; improves public health; reduces the r i s k o f economic
losses t o fishery, electricity, tourism, and agriculture; and i s important to the protection o f aquatic
ecosystems. Priority actions identified for the upcoming three t o four years include: (a)
strengthening the corresponding legal and institutional framework, including relevant
international treaties and conventions; (b) improving the system o f funding for the sector; (c)
improving environmental statistics; (d) ensuring an intersectoral approach to policy
implementation; and (e) continuing implementation o f the Bank’s Solid Waste Management
Project. Improved safety and productivity o f existing hydraulic infrastructure i s also needed t o
allow for cost-effective electricity production, and strengthening BH’s competitiveness o n the
regional energy market.

66.

The key issues faced in developing and maintaining infrastructure are well defined,
The M T D S presents a good analysis o f the major challenges in an environment where postconflict aid flows for reconstruction and rehabilitation are rapidly declining. The coal and railway
sectors are financially unviable, given overcapacity; the quality o f service in water and sanitation,
electricity, district heating, and roads i s deteriorating substantially; and district heating needs t o b e
expanded to meet demand, while markets for cleaner alternatives need t o b e developed.
Moreover, access to electronic communications networks and services, in particular in rural areas,
i s insufficient. However, expected financing through 2007 will cover less than h a l f o f the priority
investment needs, and the M T D S i s ambitious without providing a sense o f priority b o t h within
and between sectors and subsectors. Furthermore, the estimated limit o n private and public
external borrowing for investment purposes over the period constitutes a critical constraint to
attempts to bridge the investment-financing gap in infrastructure and energy. Greater selectivity
and prioritization o f investments is, therefore, essential. Ongoing progress with relevant reforms
and institutional capacity building, including overcoming fragmented networks, will also be
important t o attracting private investments for infrastructure, retaining core donor support, and
achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.

67.

Water management. BH has considerable water resources representing important
economic potential. At present, almost h a l f of total electricity production i s generated from
hydropower plants. The country, however, faces considerable water resource management
challenges. The quality of the water supply has deteriorated markedly throughout the country
since 1991, making water quality monitoring as a k e y issue. Access to a continuous water supply
i s also below pre-war levels, and even where access i s sustained water quality m a y be poor.
Between 50 and 80 percent of water supply networks are estimated to b e in need o f replacement,
and leakage has become a major issue with unaccounted water reaching a proportion o f over 60
percent in some cases. Moreover, only about 40 percent o f the urban population today has access
to sewerage. Additional challenges pertain to increasing competition within shared watersheds,
flood management, water pollution control, protection of aquatic ecosystems, and conservation o f
wetlands. These issues will require both improved inter-Entity coordination and transboundary
approaches to improving water resources management, especially regarding the more effective
use o f shared rivers. T o date, BH has been largely ineffective in addressing these problems, due
largely to ineffective, country-level institutional arrangements and a lack o f effective cooperation
with Croatia and SaM, with which i t shares k e y international waterways. T o address these issues,
a water resources management strategy needs t o b e developed at the country level, including a
viable institutional framework. At the regional level, a strategic vision and cooperation
framework needs to be developed for the transboundary Neretva, Drina, and Sava basins.

24

Box 3: BH Electricity Sector and ECSEE
The electricity sector was important for the BH economy even before independence due to a relative decline in
other economic activity. Today electricity production in BH i s sufficient both for meeting domestic needs and
providing a surplus for export. The electricity sector i s a source o f jobs and provides an important export
commodity. Economically, therefore, it i s imperative that BH maintains i t s status as one o f the main electricity
exporters in SEE and builds on its electricity export potential. Failure to do so could have serious socioeconomic
consequences.
A n important related development i s the EC-sponsored initiative establishing the Energy Community of South
Eastern Europe (ECSEE) focusing o n electricity and natural gas. BH i s a signatory o f the “Athens
Memorandum”, which launched the process establishing ECSEE, together with Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia,
KOSOVO,
SaM, Macedonia, and Turkey. The E C and the Stability Pact signed the Memorandum as i t s sponsors.
The participants have agreed to adopt rules relating to the organization and functioning of the electricity and gas
markets designed to facilitate competition and ensure that access to networks i s non-discriminatory, transparent
and fairly priced. The markets are to operate on the principles set out in the Electricity and Gas Directives and
other legislation relating to the operation o f the EU’s Internal Energy Market, including environmental
legislation.
A recent Bank-sponsored study has shown that electricity shortages could develop in the region unless
significant investments are made in installing new generation capacity, rehabilitating existing aging capacity and
upgrading transmission networks. BH could benefit significantly from the creation o f ECSEE, mainly because
of i t s surplus capacity, but also because i t will be an important transit country for electricity trading in view of
the nature o f the regional transmission network. For this, BH needs to undertake a series o f measures, including
expeditious implementation o f required reforms in the electricity sector.
The on-going Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project (Power 111), co-financed by nine donors, contributes
to BH’s participation in ECSEE through the reconstruction o f the war-damaged high-voltage transmission
network, thereby enabling full interconnection o f the network. Power ZZZ project also includes key actions
towards fulfilling BH’s commitments to ECSEE, including the establishment o f an independent national
transmission company, an independent system operator, and a national power transmission regulatory agency,
and implementation o f additional sectoral restructuring designed to encourage competition and eventual
privatization.
The Bank intends to continue to play an important role in supporting BH’s efforts to participate in ECSEE,
further to the completion of Power 111, by providing strategic advice and preparing regional projects to finance
relevant priority investments. For example, deficiencies which constrain BH’s participation in ECSEE (e.g.
environmental deficiencies at thermal power plants) w i l l be addressed under the planned Regional Energy APL
in FY06.

68. Energy. Although BH today i s a net exporter o f electricity, and i t s citizens benefit from an
affordable supply, significant investments in the sector are needed to ensure that achievements to
date are sustained and distribution meets demand. Investments are required primarily for:
rehabilitation o f the distribution network, environmental and other upgrades at aging coal-fired
power plants (consistent with EU standards), restructuring o f the heavily subsidized coalmining
industry, and augmenting existing generation capacity. Under the ongoing Bank-supported Power
I11 project some progress has been achieved, although with delays. Harmonized restructuring
action plans have been approved, and laws for the establishment o f the Single Transmission
Company and the Independent Systems Operator have been passed by Parliament, clearing the
way for rehabilitation of high voltage transmission lines and hydropower plants. In the absence o f
new investments, the sector m a y become a constraint on, rather than a source of, growth. Given
the sizable financing gap presented by these investments, however, attracting private sector
financing will be essential, in addition to optimizing the use o f available public sector financing.
The implementation o f sector reforms, which establish an appropriate legal and regulatory
fi-amework and eliminate structural inefficiencies, i s a prerequisite for attracting significant levels
of new financing, and therefore needs to be accelerated. Without these reforms, the prospects for
25

BH to privatize existing assets, attract new investments, and benefit from opportunities to
participate more actively in the ECSEE will be limited. Worse, it could be left to contend with
significant socioeconomic problems associated with stranded assets. The priorities for the
medium-term include:
0

0

0

0

Developing a comprehensive energy sector strategy for BH on the basis o f a detailed
energy sector study to be undertaken during the C A S period, which would recommend the
fkture structure o f the sector and identify options for subsector investment needs;
Restructuring o f the coal sector to ensure an affordable domestic supply while enhancing
the competitiveness o f the electricity export market;
Expeditious implementation o f the restructuring action plans as a basis for attracting
private investors and ongoing donor assistance; and
Pursuing an active role in the EC-sponsored ECSEE.

IV. W o r l d Bank G r o u p Assistance Strategy
A. Progress U n d e r the Last C A S Progress R e p o r t 2002 and Lessons L e a r n e d
69. T h e previous C A S objectives focused on broadening the concept o f poverty and
enhancing selectivity. Continuing i t s k e y role within the international community in postwar
BH, the Bank’s assistance program during FY00-02 (later extended to include FY03-04 pending
Government finalizing i t s PRSP) aimed to help BH move toward greater economic selfsufficiency and a pattern o f growth increasingly oriented toward poverty reduction. With
reconstruction w e l l in hand, i t focused less o n social and economic policy reform and more o n
poverty as an overarching and crosscutting theme in order to: (a) guide the prioritization,
selection, and implementation o f Bank activities; and (b) provide the basis for support for the
development o f the authorities’ M T D S . This enabled support to the authorities in developing the
M T D S o n the basis o f a poverty profile consistent with the Bank’s Poverty Assessment (FY03).
As requested by the authorities and other key partners, the prior C A S also sharpened the Bank’s
policy advisory role. For this reason, a significant shift in emphasis was made toward a policyoriented lending program.
70. Intermittent progress on key reforms and the development o f public institutional
capacity shaped the scope of Bank assistance. Despite considerable achievement in important
areas o f reform, the extent to which stated C A S objectives have been met has been mixed (see
Annex 7), and more uneven than during the reconstruction period. BH remained in the l o w range
of the base case (while maintaining macroeconomic stability), and not a l l IDA resources made
available under IDA 12 were committed. The reform agenda o n building social sustainability,
focused o n eliminating serious deficiencies in the social safety net, i s only partly completed, and
lags significantly behind original forecasts, while incremental progress i s being made in health
and education. M a n y o f the reforms aimed at strengthening institutions and governance have
been achieved (for example, harmonized excise and sales taxes, public administration reform,
pension reform, and a modem treasury system), albeit at a m u c h slower pace than expected and
with a perceptibly higher risk to sustainability given limited capacity and issues compromising
institution building and good governance. In the area o f fostering private-sector-led growth, even
slower progress has been achieved in undertaking priority privatization and business enabling
measures has been realized, although the significant gains in the banking sector are likely to be
sustained.

26

71. T h e FY05-07 CAS incorporates the recommendations o f the recent CAE. Covering
1996-2003 (that is, since the inception o f the Bank’s program in the newly formed state o f BH),
the CAE concludes that the Bank’s assistance was satisfactory overall. As a m a i n contributor to
post-conflict reconstruction, the Bank’s performance i s judged “timely and highly relevant and
should serve as an example of good practice in post-conflict reconstruction.” IDA-financed
emergency projects and other activities had a major impact in restoring critical services and
supporting a fbnctioning government. IDA’Sassistance was seen as largely effective also in terms
of i t s support for social protection, employment, labor markets, education, health (especially in
the area o f primary health care), and infi-astructure. In terms o f public sector reform, the Bank
achieved notable success. The CAE observed that budget management and tax harmonization and
coordination were effectively advanced, due in large part to exemplary project preparation and
supervision, and Supreme Audit Institutions were established. It noted limited success, however,
in customs duties collection, and debatable delays in the introduction o f the VAT. On the other
hand, i t noted weaknesses in the formulation and implementation o f the (voucher) privatization
strategy and corresponding donor coordination. Furthermore, the business environment i s noted
to be one o f the least attractive regionally. The CAE also found that, while the privatization and
restructuring o f the banking sector i s progressing well, there i s considerable room for
improvement in mobilizing and allocating savings to private enterprises.
72. T h e focus o f future Bank assistance i s grounded in the lessons o f experience.
Collectively, OED evaluations, Quality Assistance Group (QAG) reviews, experience with project
implementation support and external input constitute the body o f lessons learned that guided C A S
formulation. The principal lessons guiding the program o f assistance to BH are as follows.
What worked well:
0

0

I C support for public administration and social sector reform has led to gradually
improving government ownership and the critical first steps toward necessary labor
market and social protection reforms, albeit within a longer timeframe than envisioned,
and with comprehensive challenges remaining. Basic public administration structures
have been built. Furthermore, interventions aimed at increasing growth through
employment generation have been appropriately targeted to the small scale, informal
sector through local and community-based operations. Core elements o f the Bank’s
assistance program in the health sector have been incorporated into the M T D S and are the
basis for “scaling-up” future Bank activity.
Strong diagnostics and other analytical work as a basis for program development.
Given BH’s complex operating environment, and weak fiduciary, procurement, and
statistical capacities, diagnostic w o r k such as the Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review (PEIR) (FY02), core Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) (FY02),
Country Finuncial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) (FY03), Local Government
Finance Study (FY03), Labor Market Study, and Poverty Assessment (FY03), as well as
other analysis including the widely-referenced FIAS report, will continue to be an
important IDA function. Future analytical and advisory activities (AAA) must be highly
selective, within a reduced IDA envelope, and integral to the design and delivery o f the
lending program, reflecting a multisectoral and regional focus, while balancing BH’s
strong demand for such services.

27

Stakeholder involvement as a basis for reform. Social policy reform, although m u c h
slower than projected, has been enabled through outreach focused o n both policymakers
and beneficiaries. Good practices in supporting the dialogue o n social and labor market
policy, in particular, have been followed. Perhaps most important, the governments’ own
M T D S , with the encouragement o f the IC, was prepared with wide participation and
consultation throughout the country, and strong stakeholder involvement i s expected
throughout the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation processes.
The overall quality of theportfolio has been maintained. With intensive supervision and
focus o n outcomes, portfolio quality has been maintained above regional and Bank
averages. A proactive posture toward removing impediments t o the smooth
implementation o f projects, especially in the areas o f family medicine and procurement
for investments, and deepened policy dialogue enabling the eventual fulfillment of
adjustment triggers, has defined a workable approach t o risk management. As the reform
agenda deepens, however, and the social changes necessary to bring this about become
more difficult t o achieve, the challenges to realizing timely and sustainable operational
milestones can be expected t o increase.

What worked less well:
0

0

e

Increased ownership is needed to maximize the impact of Bank assistance. BH’s
complex government structures, as w e l l as vested and “ethnic” resistance, has inhibited
efforts t o build and sustain support for reform, leading to missed opportunities.
Satisfactory progress o n meeting the initial criteria for follow-up adjustment support for
social protection was achieved, but nearly two years later than first foreseen (see B o x 2).
Technical assistance has met with intermittent and often inadequate Government
commitment. Aiming to address these issues, the M T D S establishes a common strategy
as a basis for determining nationwide priorities. This CAS, in turn, i s firmly rooted in the
MTDS, and places greater emphasis o n political economy considerations in future
operations. Future technical assistance, l e d primarily by bilateral donors with Bank
cooperation, w o u l d lend support t o this objective.
The approach to governance must be deepened and integrated across sectors. Given the
fragmented public administration and traditional interests, developing good governance
within BH’s post-conflict environment i s a long-term objective. Governments’ o w n AntiCorruption Action Plan, (para. 24), emphasizes enhancing transparency in public sector
management, promoting the rationalization o f public spending, and improving
intergovernmental finance and capacity building, further to the recommendations o f the
Anti-Corruption Diagnosis (FYO1). An integrated and time-bound approach to improving
overall governance and implementation o f the plan i s needed, however, as evidenced by
the lack o f more transparent and viable private sector activities.
Capacity constraints are an ongoing impediment to implementation. Although their
numbers have been gradually reduced as a result o f full o r partial integration into
government functions o r ministries, or by merger, Project Management Units (PMUs)essential during reconstruction-continue t o provide implementation support for the
majority o f investment projects. Concerted efforts are required t o deepen and sustain
government capacity and ultimately ensure the full mainstreaming o f project management.
As a first next step, all future projects will be implemented through government structures
28

as agreed in the context o f the 2003 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR).
Strengthened stakeholder involvement in implementation support i s also being pursued to
help manage the risks to project sustainability. However, until such time that satisfactory
public procedures and processes are in place, specific fiduciary responsibilities, such as
financial management and procurement, must be contracted out to safeguard the Bank’s
fiduciary obligations. A further severe capacity constraint remains the absence o f reliable
economic and social data in BH, reinforcing the urgent need for the authorities to
streamline and strengthen statistical services.
e

Donor coordination continues to be a challenge. Although the SAP has come t o be
accepted as the prevailing basis for national priority setting, together with the MTDS,
support f i o m the Bank and the I C has not yet resulted in government-led donor

coordination. The authorities have yet to assume full leadership over the process o f
reconciling donor interests and managing competing development agendas. Therefore, the
imperative for the authorities to coordinate and develop mechanisms to best direct scarce
resources to where they are needed most becomes more urgent with declining donor
assistance. An integrated, state-level process for managing development resources, with
clear links to economic policy formulation, M T D S implementation, and EU integration
requires that the authorities assume ultimate responsibility for this important function.

B. Proposed World Bank Group Program

73. The proposed FY05-07 CAS i s informed by BH’s track record and i s anchored in the
MTDS. I t i s structured along three mutually reinforcing pillars, mirroring BH’s principal
challenges:

9
9
P

Pillar 1:
Pillar 2:
Pillar 3:

Improving Public Finance and StrengtheningInstitutions
Promoting Sustainable Private-Sector-Led Growth
Investing in Key Social and Economic Infrastructure

T o ensure a self-sustaining economy and a fiscally sustainable public sector in the medium- to
long- term, the C A S strives to help government reduce the weight o f the public sector in the
economy. This i s a prerequisite to giving the private sector room to grow, thereby stimulating
productive activity, domestic private and public savings, and export growth. The Bank will
support government efforts to increase public sector efficiency, particularly in the delivery o f propoor social and economic infrastructure services, while significantly improving governance in
both the private and public sectors. Consistent with the MTDS, the C A S will support significant
structural reforms in the private and public sectors, together with targeted interventions in selected
sectors. These measures, combined with complementary assistance from other partners, will, if
effectively implemented, translate into economic growth, employment creation and increased
social cohesion in BH.

74. At the end o f FY04, BH graduated from its exceptional post-conflict IDA status.
Therefore, in future the available resource envelope for BH will be relatively more constrained.
This has a number o f direct implications for the Bank’s program in BH:

9 The need to be even more selective and focused o n areas o f World Bank Group
comparative advantage in the specific BH context;
P T o provide for programmatic structural adjustment support (see description o f
Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (PSAC) below), grounded in the country’s

29

>

MTDS, designed around a multi-year program o f policy reform, and providing for reliable
financial support over the medium-term;
T o assist the country in attaining creditworthiness, as envisioned in the MTDS, and to
prepare for the gradual transition to International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) lending;
T o leverage the significant existing IDA portfolio for maximum outcomes;
T o work in even closer partnership with all key partners, in particular with the EC in view
of the SAP process; and
T o fully leverage the synergies within the WBG: IDNIBRD, IFC, the Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and WBI.

75. F o r the first time, the BH C A S correlates the Bank’s interventions and targeted outcomes
with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and with BH’s own outcome targets as
spelled out in the M T D S . Although the MDGs are reflected in the M T D S targets, the M T D S
implementation plan i s not always clear h o w these would be achieved and the relevant programs
financed. Nonetheless, considering current trends, BH appears generally o n track to achieve the
MDG poverty, education, and health goals (Table 4). BH would reduce poverty by one-fifth by
2007, during the current M T D S o r C A S period, and by h a l f by 2015 (assuming at least 2 percent
growth per annum per capita). Addressing priority investment needs in the water supply and
sanitation sectors, and reaching the related MDG, will be more difficult, however, requiring
financing at a level significantly above current projections o f available resources. IDA i s continuing
to support BH’s efforts to meet the MDGs with particular emphasis o n health, improving access to
sustainable and safe water sources and mainstreaming the principles o f sustainable development
within natural resource management. Furthermore, IDA continues to provide substantive support to
BH’s efforts to strengthen poverty diagnostics and monitoring.
Pillar 1: Improving Public Finance and Strengthening Institutions

76. The objectives and expected outcomes under Pillar 1 are: (a) a leaner and more efficient
public administration and c i v i l service, (b) institutionalization o f fiscal coordination between various
levels o f government, (c) more efficient and higher-quality education administration, (d) bettertargeted and more efficient social safety nets, and (e) greater transparency and accountability o f
public resource management. M a j o r outcome measures for the C A S period would include: the
level o f Entity payroll expenses falls within approved budgets; State and Entity budgets are
consistent with the national aggregate fiscal policy target beginning in 2005; higher education i s
adequately funded through Entity budgets beginning in 2005; a new policy o f employment services
(on active and passive) labor markets i s operational; and laws o n fiscal responsibilities (across
governments) are approved. See also the Annex 11, results-oriented framework.

77. Ongoing IDA support. The primary Bank instrument in support o f the first pillar i s the
recently approved Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC), which supports
the implementation o f a broad public expenditure management reform agenda aimed at (a) reducing
the excessive burden of government; and (b) improving the efficiency, equity, and transparency o f
public expenditure. It supports expenditure rationalization and restructuring, related public
administration reforms, c i v i l service reform, selected reforms in education, reforms of
intergovernmental fiscal relations and the governance o f expenditure management (reforms o f
procurement, audit, and conflict-of-interest policies and practices). Fulfilling the objectives of the
EMSAC would demonstrate strong performance towards meeting Pillar 1 outcomes.

number o f matemal
deaths for the region war
50 per 100,000 live
births.

6. Halt and reverse by
2015 the spread of
HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis (TB).

The number o f HIVinfected people increased
from 30,000 in 1998 to
1.5 million in 2003.

7. Reduce by half the
proportion o f people
without sustainable
access to safe drinking
water.

In 2000 about 96% o f
ECA’s urban population
had access to improved
water source, and about
83% o f ECA’s rural
population.

8. Integrate the principles

Current Situation in BH
In 2001, the proportion o f the
population living in absolute poverty
(consumption per capita below the
national absolute poverty line based
on LSMS data) was 19.5 percent. No
data exist about the poverty situation
in 1990.

In 2001, the primary education
completion rate for BH was 77

percent and the net enrollment rate 93
percent.
In 2001, there was no significant
difference between enrollment rates
o f boys and girls.
Infant mortality in 1990 was 15.3 per
1,000 live births and decreased to 7.6
in 2001.
U5MR in 1990 was 17.2 and
decreased to 8.7 in 2001.
Conflicting estimates produced by
WHOAJNICEF and UNFPA
fluctuating from 10.5 in 1990
decreasing to 9.5 in 1999 according
to UNICEF, while UNFPA cites 3 1 in
2000.

Cumulative number of HIV cases
oficially reported from 1985 to mid2003 was 64. No reliable data are
available for HIV, but UNAIDS
estimates that at the end o f 2001, there
were 900 adults with HIV/AIDS, with
an overall adult HIV prevalence of less
than 0.1 percent. 91 cases in 1990 per
100,000 down to 65.7 in 2001.
In 2002, 80% o f the population had

Projections by 2015
The country w i l l reduce poverty
incidence by half in 2015
compared to 2001 with a stable 2
percent growth mte for per
capita consumption (consistent
with macro projections) provided
income distnbution does not
worsen (Le., inequality remains
at its 2001 level).
The M D G target i s likely to be
met.
The M D G target i s likely to be
met.

Both infant mortality and the
under-5 mortality rate modeled
estimates and official data are
trending downward, and their
MDGs are likely to be achieved.
Despite the increase in MM
modeled estimates, the official
data, which are trending
downwards, are thought to be
more reliable. Therefore, the
M M R M D G target is considered
likely to be achieved.
Currently B H appears to be on
track to meet AIDS and TB MDG
targets.

Meeting the M D G target w i l l
require very substantial
investments and efforts.

BH has better present indicators
than the average o f ECA for
energy use and C 0 2 emissions,
and worse than ECA average
indicators for protected areas
and people using solid fuels.
Forested area i s high and
quality o f management i s
gradually improving.
Overall trends are favorable.

78. Consistent with the reform agenda supported by the EMSAC, the also recently approved
Second Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC 11) supports reforms in BH’s cash transfer
programs, in particular veterans’ benefits, social welfare, child protection, employment services, and
the pension system (para. 105).
79. New IDA lending support. At the heart o f IDA’S three-year lending program (in the base and
high case) will b e a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit for Public Sector Reform and
Private Sector Development (PSAC). I t will be a multisectoral PSAC, cutting across all three pillars
in direct support o f the MTDS. It will consist o f a series o f credits within a multiyear framework (i.e.
over the three-year C A S period), each building upon the preceding credit with the overarching
objective o f supporting a sustained and sequential reform program. In this way, the PSAC will be
designed to: (a) foster country ownership by building directly upon Government’s o w n program o f
policy reforms; (b) provide reliable financial support for successful reforms; (c) provide for
flexibility in accommodating the uncertainties inherent in medium-term reform programs; and (d)
serve as a cost-effective vehicle for policy dialogue with the client and for partnerships with other
donors, Anticipated priority activities most likely to be covered are, inter alia, (a) corporate
restructuring, (b) labor market reform, and (c) public finance reform (particularly in the pension
systems and health sector). Each credit i s intended to support a one-year program, with i t s respective
tranches tied to specific target measures. Monitorable indicators will be built into the design o f each
credit in the series.
80. If BH were to fall into the l o w case lending scenario, the PSAC would be substituted by two
smaller IDA credits with the objective o f maintaining the policy dialogue, fostering ownership, and
strengthening institutions for the intended reforms. In FY06 PSAC would b e substituted by a Public
Sector Reform Project.
81. The Education Restructuring Project (ERP), foreseen for FY05, will suppoi-t E M S A C
objectives in tertiary education financing, and tackling secondary education reform. In particular, it
will promote greater efficiency and relevance through reform o f university programs, modernizing
the funding arrangements for universities, and increasing the relevance o f secondary education.
Measures o f progress would include: newly proposed laws o n higher education being upheld; an
increase (from one to seven) in the number o f universities transitioning to corporate structures; and
the number o f schools being funded o n the basis o f a per student formula raised.
82. Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA).
The Bank’s flagship analytical report
underpinning this pillar remains the 2002 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR).16 I t
provides the primary analytical basis for all Bank-supported activities under this first pillar, and
beyond. An update i s planned for FY06. Institution building i s also envisaged as an important facet
of the planned Environmental Benchmarking (FY05), and Energy Sector (FY05) AAA w o r k (see
also paras 112, 113).
83. Updates to the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Poverty Assessment
(PA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) are also planned for FY06, F Y 0 7 and
FY07 respectively. Furthermore, a Pensions Reform Study i s planned for FY06, which will guide the
design o f a core component o f the PSAC. In FY07, the Bank plans to provide a set o f Policy Notes
to the incoming administration after the 2006 national elections.

84. A PRSP Trust Fund provides financial support to the EPPU and will, together with parallel
assistance from the EC, assist the Council o f Ministers in establishing the processes and institutional
arrangements necessary for overall M T D S implementation, with focus o n developing the statistical
capacity to assess the poverty and social impact o f development interventions. It i s expected that
donor support will be phased out and the unit fully mainstreamed well within the C A S period.
85. World Bank Institute (WBI) and Global Development Learning Network (GDLN). A
training program i s currently being designed by WBI in support o f intergovernmental relations and
fiscal policy design, which will start in FY05 and be in direct support o f E M S A C objectives. The
delivery o f this program would be assisted by GDLN, as a component o f a series o f GDLN events in
support o f C A S and project objectives (see B o x 4). One such training program i s in support o f AntiMoney Laundering efforts and i s currently being provided through GDLN.
Box 4. Global Development Learning N e t w o r k (GLDN) in BH

As a cost-effective communications tool, the GDLN is becoming increasingly important in supporting the Bank’s
operations in BH, utilized in capacity building, strategy and policy work, dissemination o f Economic Sector Work
(ESW) results, project preparation and implementation, and CAS and PRSP consultations. I t s benefits include improved
resource allocation, reduced travel time and expenses, faster decision-making, and enhanced participation.
The BH network o f three distance-learning centers (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Banja Luka) and two Bank videoconferencing
facilities (Sarajevo, Banja Luka) enables increased outreach. In the past year, most GDLN events delivered to BH were
regonal or global events (with few exceptions such as the Disaster Management Strategy and M T D S consultations), not
specifically tailored to the country or the region (e.g. Development o f Enabling Environments for small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), Good Governance, Anti-Corruption Training, Public Sector Management). The first countryspecific Bank course on Decentralization and Intergovernmental Fiscal Reform, was delivered simultaneously through
three country sites in 2003, and i s being requested in 2004.
With the help o f ECA GDLN, more WBUGDLN additional country-specific programming i s being delivered in 2004
including: Anti-Money-Laundering, and procurement training for the Transport and Privatization projects. Each program
w i l l support a specific project from the country portfolio (EMSAC, BAC, TTFSE, PTAC). Opportunities for tailoring
WBI courses on social safety nets and core courses on labor markets to support SOSAC I1 are s t i l l being investigated, as
i s the opportunity for preparing a series o f virtual dialogues on Municipal Credit Markets to support the Local
Development Pilot Project.
I n line with the key strategic considerations for the CAS FY05-07, the Bank will use GDLN to:
a
Continue building capacity in government, private sector, and NGOs through WBUGDLN programs;
m
Communicate the rationale and benefits of reforms to government and civil society by facilitating countrywide
dialogues and exposing the country to international best practices;
Facilitate an ongoing consultation process with the govemment and a wide range o f partners in the country and
region through thematic dialogues, which should provide timely and qualitative feedback on CAS priorities and
activities, and on the Bank’s performance; and
Deliver local staff training programs to support the ongoing decentralization process.

Pillar 2: Promoting Sustainable Private-Sector-Led Growth
86. The objectives and expected outcomes during the CAS period under this pillar are: (a)
lower barriers to business activity; (b) more competitive, investment-friendly enterprises; (c)
improved corporate sector operations; (d) more robust private sector financing services; (e) raised
efficiency and access to core economic infrastructure; and (Q more efficient and sustainable natural
resources utilization. K e y outcome measures, supported by both the existing and proposed Bank
programs, would include: new bankruptcy laws implemented; business inspections rationalized
across Entities; strategic enterprises categorized by their readiness for privatization and governments
agree to a comprehensive debt resolution strategy for priority SOEs, and transport time and costs
lowered.

33

87. Ongoing IDA support. IDA i s currently supporting the objectives o f the second C A S pillar
with a number o f existing credits. The Business Enabling Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC)
supports reforms that will (a) facilitate business entry; (b) streamline the environment for business
operation; and (c) ease business exit through strengthened bankruptcy and liquidation regulations.
Progress would be measurable in part through anticipated reductions in the average number of days
to register a business, the number o f steps to register and enterprise; and the average number of onsite inspector days per inspected business per year.
88. The Privatization Technical Assistance Credit (PTAC) i s aimed at competing successfully
large-scale privatization through tender sale o f state-owned enterprises, and at helping to prepare the
legal and regulatory frameworks required for private sector participation. D u e to slow progress thus
far (PTAC became effective in M a y 2002) and a request from the borrower, Management intends to
restructure the credit to facilitate the successfbl completion o f privatization, including support for
corporate restructuring, and labor market reforms (see also PSAC below). Outcome measures would
be reformulated during project restructuring.
89. T w o IDA projects directly support j o b creation in BH. The objectives o f the Local Initiatives
Project II (LIPII) are to raise incomes, develop businesses, and create jobs through the provision of
credit and other financial services to low-income individuals. So far the results have been very
promising. Nine Micro-Credit Organizations (MCOs) contracted under the LIPII currently have over
65,000 active clients, o f which about 50% are women, and collectively manage a cumulative loan
portfolio o f over KM146 million. These microenterprises provide employment for about 138,000
people. MCOs have also increased their outreach to rural areas and are making a significant
contribution to the development of small-scale agriculture and farming. The Pilot Emergency Labor
Redeployment Project (PELRP) has provided close to 6,000 ex-soldiers with the means to a selfreliant existence, through counseling and on-the-job training and business advisory services, The
project has also tested different active labor market measures to encourage employment generation
and small business creation. These approaches will continue to be supported under the recently
approved successor Second Employment Support Project (SESP), which also aims at providing
technical assistance in the ongoing process o f reforming the operations and policies of BH’s
Employment Services to better address the major problem o f high unemployment, particularly among
youth.
90. In the area of trade and export promotion, IDA i s currently providing support through two
credits. The Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project (TTFSE) i s one of eight
parallel country projects linked under the regional Trade and Transport Facilitation Program
umbrella. In BH, TTFSE supports physical improvements at selected border crossings, and technical
assistance to strengthen customs administration with a view to reducing costs to trade and transport,
reducing smuggling and corruption at border crossings, and strengthening regional partnerships and
expanding regional trade. The BH Enterprise Export Facility Project (BEEF) supports BH’s
Investment Guarantee Agency (IGA) in facilitating and expanding viable export activity through a
working capital facility and a performance bond facility.
91. In the area of agriculture and forestry, important for growth in rural areas, IDA i s providing
support though two projects. The objective of the Small-Scale Commercial Agriculture Development
Project i s to develop private, market-integrated commercial agriculture in selected low-income, highpotential areas o f BH. The Forestry Development and Consewation Project (FDCP) assists with the
implementation o f legislated reforms in forest organization and management, which are expected to

34

increase revenues from forest resources, but also to improve forest management and enhance
biodiversity conservation through participatory approaches in forest use planning.
92. New IDA lending support. One k e y reform area to b e supported under by the planned PSAC
will b e the design and implementation o f a comprehensive strategy for revitalizationof enterprises
through reforms in corporate governance and in the structure and deployment o f economic assets
determining the performance o f the corporate sector. The ovemding activity will be to assist the
governments with orchestrating a timely and fiscally affordable divestiture o f assets in a w a y that
unleashes the potential for achieving higher yields from underutilized state-owned assets and undermanaged mass-privatized productive capacity. Renewed commitment by the governments to
acceleration of privatization and improvement o f corporate governance, supported by the Bank’s
experience and commitment o f assistance, form the backbone o f the new program based o n
deployment of streamlined and new approaches t o corporate sector reforms. This phase of PSAC i s
currently in i t s identification stage. In line with the MTDS, the credit will address the overindebtedness and corporate governance challenges o f SOEs and voucher-privatized f i r m s with a view
to removing this significant bottleneck in the growth prospects o f the BH economy. I t s specific
objectives will be to: (a) streamline and accelerate privatization, (b) strengthen corporate governance,
(c) promote creditor-led restructuring for enterprises that are in financial blockage (d) scale-up the
number of bankruptcy cases within the newly adopted Bankruptcy law, and (e) continue with the
business environment agenda once BAC has come to an end. While a principal measure o f PSAC
reform w o u l d b e a reduction in the share o f loss-making large SOEs, more specific indicators,
monitorable during implementation, would be designed t o reflect progress in each performance
related to the respective project components.
93. A further reform area covered by PSAC will b e labor market reform. I t will include a
fundamental reform o f the wage-setting mechanism, deepen reform o f the Employment Institutes t o
provide more cost-effective active and passive labor market support (building o n prior SOSAC I1and
the support o f the Second Employment Support Project (SESP)), and address the issue o f labor
taxation.
94. AAA. In support o f the priority objectives under this pillar, a follow up to the 2002 Labor
Market Study i s planned for FY05 t o inform the design o f the PSAC. A Debt Sustainability Analysis
will be completed in FY06. A full Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) i s also planned for
FY06.
95. IFC, FIAS, and MIGA. IFC will continue to have a multidimensional strategy in BH
encompassing all sectors o f the economy, particularly SMEs and traditional competitive industries, as
well as development needs in financial markets and infrastructure (Annex 8). IFC will look for
opportunities to support local medium-size companies with capacity to be successful in the regional
market. IFC recognizes that investment projects in BH require substantial technical assistance if they are
to become bankable prospects. Accordingly, IFC will continue to combine investment operations in
strategically targeted areas with various non-investment operations. In addition, IFC will implement
innovative approaches to achieve results, such as the restructuring and privatization o f the co~ntry’s
largest banlung group (see B o x 5).
96. IFC will continue to support SMEs using i t s well-established Southeast Europe Enterprise
Development (SEED) facility (see B o x 6), as w e l l as by providing them with long-term funding
through local banks. SEED’s sectoral focus will b e restricted to the wood, furniture, automotive
parts, and construction sectors. Full integration o f SEED’s technical assistance with IFC’s
investment w o r k i s being pursued in order t o develop a j o i n t approach t o project development.
35

S E E D will b e working on linkages programs to integrate S M E s into the supply chains o f large
companies to the ultimate benefit o f both, a n area where IFC will help with financing.
Box 5. BH:
Innovative Approaches in Banking Privatization Achieve Results
The privatization o f Bosnia’s largest banking group, the successor bank o f United Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS),
continues to demonstrate the benefits o f an innovation that IFC pioneered in cooperation with the World Bank and
IMF, and with support from SIDA. In December 2001, the BH Ministry o f Finance, IFC, and the Austrian
investment company BPIC jointly established a special-purpose vehicle called Sarajevo Privatization Venture. With
€10.5 million in finding from IFC and €1 million from BPIC, this new entity paid o f f the foreign pre-war creditors
of the former United PBS, liabilities that had made it impossible to attract strategic investors in time to meet a
privatization deadline set by the IMF. The new entity, SPV, in return acquired majority stakes in three successor
banks, Privredna Banka Sarajevo, Central Profit Banka, and Travnicka Banka. Thus, after many years o f
restructuring efforts, the United PBS banks could finally be privatized. Upon acquisition, SPV merged Central
Profit Banka and Travnicka Banka. In FY04, SPV sold the merged bank to Bank Austria Creditanstalt, a leading
corporate and retail banlung group in Austria, proving that privatization had made the successor banks commercially
viable and attractive for acquisition.

97. The financial sector i s IFC’s focus in BH. IFC’s strategy i s to build o n its successful
experience and positive results to facilitate the strengthening o f financial intermediaries in BH. IFC
will help strategic investors to establish greenfield banks and good local financial institutions to
develop into high-quality banks. Also, IFC will continue to p l a y a catalytic and honest broker role in
restructuring and facilitating the privatization process o f the banking sector in the country. To
support SMEs, IFC will pursue a threefold approach. It will: (a) continue to establish credit lines to
banks that lend primarily to small businesses; (b) seek to diversify i t s products, giving S M E s access
to alternate forms o f financing; (c) help the banks with right tools needed to enter the S M E market.
Box 6: SEED in BH
SEED i s a multi-donor partnership, led by IFC, in support o f SME development in the region. In 2003, SEED
introduced a new, integrated platform approach targeted at four strategic client groups or pillars: (i)
Access to
Finance; (ii)
Linkages; (iii)
Business Membership Organizations; and (iv) Institutional Development. This approach
ensures integration o f SEED’s products with the needs o f key partners by means o f mobilizing internal and external
resources in order to act as a local implementer.
The Access t o Finance pillar addresses some o f the crippling problems o f SME financing through the development
and advocacy o f new financing solutions. Leasing i s being introduced as a valuable financial tool to supplement
conventional lending. A pilot program to introduce alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms i s f i l l y
operational. Two other programs in the pipeline a i m at introducing factoring and housing finance products.
Within the Business Membership Organizations pillar, SEED i s focused o n enhancing general and advocacy
capacities o f new associations. In addition, training and consultancy i s mobilized to the membership as part o f the
service being provided by the BMO. Work i s ongoing with the RS Employers’ Confederation, as well as the
construction, wood, privatization investment funds and herbal sectors o f BH.
The ‘Linkages’ or Supply Chain Management Program helps provide essential supply and distribution technical
consulting and training to all SMEs operating within the framework o f a large company’s supply chain. This work
provides direct support to large companies seelung to enhance their own operations and become more attractive to
FDI. Currently SEED i s working in the automobile parts and food sectors.
The Institutional Development pillar aims at establishing the missing llnks or strengthening the weakest points in
institutional support to SMEs. The Local Economic Development program (LED) currently underway in BH i s a
good example o f this, where municipalities are involved in rethinking their role o f providing support to SMEs and
adjusting their development policies to better suit the needs o f business. Structuring SEED’s efforts in this way has
brought significant scope to its activities and allows SEED to operate at several levels including consulting, training,
capacity building programs and business enabling environment interventions.

36

98. MIGA’s gross exposure in BH as of M a y 31,2004 was US$208 million. Although BH’s share
in MIGA’s total portfolio i s only 3.8 percent, the country ranks seventh in the l i s t o f MIGA’s
highest-exposure countries. MIGA’s exposure i s for a large part in the financial sector. Going
forward, MIGA will take a more strategic look at the type o f projects i t will support. M a n y of
MIGA’s guarantee opportunities will depend o n BH’s own efforts to speed up the privatization

process and the potential for foreign investment which could benefit from MIGA support, including
in the infrastructure sectors. In addition, BH m a y benefit from MIGA’s Small Investment Program
(SIP), which provides for a standardized package o f political risk insurance and a streamlined
underwriting process to support smaller investors in the manufacturing, agribusiness, and services
sectors. BH will also benefit from’two MIGA technical assistance programs (see Annex 9).

99. FIAS’s Administrative Barriers Review of 2001 serves as the foundation for much o f the
Bank’s ongoing support for strengthening the business environment in BH. However, i t i s clear that
the capacity o f State and Entity governments to develop, advance, and monitor the business
environment reform agenda needs further strengthening. This will be critical to sustain political
commitment and support implementation. The F I A S identifies the fundamental objectives for BH
therefore to: (a) establish a legal framework for regulatory governance, including regulatory impact
analysis; (b) facilitate the institutionalization o f capacity for implementation o f this framework; and
(c) develop a w o r k program to support a strategic approach to business environment reform, in
conformity with EU practices in good governance. These objectives are being supported by the
ongoing BAC.
100. WBI will support a capacity-enhancement program in support o f the private sector
development agenda, which will address the role o f business in society and foster a better
understanding o f the underlying rationale o f BAC, PTAC, and corporate restructuring reform
agendas. A training program in support o f Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts i s also currently
being provided through the GDLN.

Pillar 3: Investing in K e y Social and Economic Infrastructure
101. The objectives and expected outcomes during the CAS period under this multi-faceted
pillar are: (a) promoting effective protection o f the vulnerable through a fiscally sustainable social
safety net, including rationalized veterans benefits; (b) improved health sector management and
better access to quality health care; (c) improved service quality in water and sanitation, electricity,
and local roads; (d) a higher quality and more equitable education system; (e) greater rural
agriculture productivity and profitability; and (0 conservation o f critical forests and mountain
ecosystems. Principal outcome measures are expected to include: veterans’ legislation i s
implemented; a pension policy i s harmonized between the Entities; a master plan for the
rationalization o f hospital services i s completed; the share o f the population covered by health
insurance i s increased; and assessment performance measures for math and literacy are established.
Furthermore, a common theme across the relevant lending and AAA program i s that o f social
inclusion and cohesiveness, encouraging cooperation amongst ethnic groups and ensuring that
development assistance i s targeted towards the more vulnerable populations.
102. Ongoing IDA support. The existing IDA portfolio contains a number o f projects under
implementation in support o f C A S objectives under the third pillar.
103. Social policy reform. The recently approved SOSAC I1constitutes a cornerstone o f the Bank’s
program in BH. Designed to reflect the findings o f the comprehensive analysis o f the public transfer
system and i t s impact upon various beneficiary groups provided by the Bank’s initial Poverty
37

Assessment (FY03) for BH, the operation supports priority reforms o f veterans’ benefits, social
welfare, child protection, employment services, and the pension system. Aiming to ensure that social
policy reforms are undertaken on the basis o f an improved statistical information system, and that
living standards monitoring i s more effective and timely, the project supports the Statistical Institutes
in updating household survey data and completing field work, and promotes dissemination o f survey
results for public research and analysis. The Social Insurance Technical Assistance Project (SITAP)
i s strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency o f health and pension insurance systems by
providing advice and training in designing reform options for the future. In tandem with SOSAC I1
and the recently completed B H P (para. 53), i t paves the w a y for health and pensions reforms to be
supported through the PSAC (paras. 79, 92).

104. Education. The Education Development Project (EDP) promotes social cohesion through
education, and aims to improve the overall quality of teaching and learning, through supports for
Quality Fund to stimulate innovation at the primary school level, a Standards and Assessments
Agency, and an Education Management Information System.
105. Rural Development and Environment. IDA provides support for agriculture and forestry
though two ongoing projects (para. 87)’ the Small-Scale Commercial Agriculture Development
Project and the Forestry Development and Conservation Project (FDCP), both o f which are designed
to contribute substantively to BH’s efforts to boost sustainable rural development and build local
institutions. In addition, the country’s recent membership in the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
opens the way for the targeted support of BH’s environmental strategy (para. 65), significantly
augmenting the Bank program over the C A S period (see B o x 7).
Box 7. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) in Bosnia and Herzegovina
The GEF supports the CAS in several key areas: improved management o f international water bodies, and improved
biodiversity, and landscape management. Three operations are planned for the CAS period, comprising US$20.5
million in grants.
A proposed grant o f US$8.5 million to improve Water Quality in the Bosnia and Neretva Rivers w i l l complement
the Mostar Water Supply and Sanitation Project and support water pollution control through improved municipal
wastewater treatment. I t forms a part of the broader Black SealDanube nutrient-reduction program. A proposed
grant o f US$8 million w i l l support improved Integrated Ecosystem Management of the Neretva and Trebisjinica
Rivers and their delta, shared between Croatia and BH, which flow into the Adriatic Sea. The grant will strengthen
joint river management and cooperation, and help balance competing demands for water use in the basin. A
proposed grant o f U S $ 4 million w i l l complement the ongoing Forest Development and Conservation Project. This
Biodiversity Conservation Project would increase BH’s globally significant forest and mountain landscapes under
protection and enable ecosystems sustainability through improved management.
In addition to protecting global public goods, the proposed grants support CAS objectives in other ways. The Water
Quality project supports investments in essential infrastructure and more cost-effective management. The
Integrated Ecosystem project supports implementation o f the EU water framework directive through the
development o f an integrated approach to river basin management. I t also ensures that any further energy-related
developments using the rivers are undertaken in an environmentally sustainable way. Sustainable water, landscape,
and forest management, supported by both the Ecosystem and Conservation projects, are essential building blocks
for recovery o f a landscape-based tourism industry, and for agriculture- and forest-based economic activities.

106. Community Development and Social Inclusion. Since the war, IDA has strongly supported
municipal infrastructure development in a variety of ways. Currently, there are five projects under
implementation in this area. The Community Development Project (CDP) improves basic services
for low-income communities in underserved municipalities through investments in non-revenuegenerating, socially oriented projects. It i s also aimed at improving the governance and capacity of

38

local governments to deliver services to the poor. The Local Development Pilot Project (LDP) also
strengthens the capacity o f municipal governments to enable them to provide improved infrastructure
and services to citizens and to help stimulate local growth. Innovations under L D P are the initiation
of a municipal credit market and a revolving loan fund. The objective o f the recently approved
Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery Project i s threefold: (a) to improve the availability,
quality, and reliability of basic municipal services, and in particular, water supply and sanitation; (b)
to strengthen the ability o f Cantonal and municipal governments to improve management and
institutional capacity for infrastructure development through Urban Management Development
Plans; and (c) to foster deeper social cohesion through improvements in overall living conditions.
The objectives o f the Mostar Water Supply and Sanitation Project are to create a unified water
supply and sanitation utility for the city o f Mostar (now completed) and to improve services. As a
further contribution to the unification o f Mostar, the Pilot Cultural Heritage Project has helped
reconstruct the famous old bridge, a symbol o f unity, and other historical monuments. The Solid
Waste Management Project (SWMP) also operates in Mostar and unifies the solid waste services in
the city, but it also operates in other BH municipalities across the country to improve services,
capacity, and cost recovery, as w e l l as to correct the significant environmental problems with solid
waste (for example, closure o f “wild dumpsites”).

107. Transport. The Road Management and Safety Project (RMSP) i s designed to improve traffic
flow and reduce the very high accident rates in BH through rehabilitation o f priority road sections
such as accident “black spots.”
108. Energy and reform o f utilities. In close partnership with the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), EC, the European Investment Bank
(EIB), the Kreditanstalt fir Wiederaufbau (KfW), Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD),
Switzerland, and US. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Third Electric Power
Reconstruction Project (Power 111) continues the post-conflict reconstruction program in the power
sector in BH, combined with support for restructuring and reforms. It aims to ensure reliable, lowercost electricity, to be supplied with reduced environmental and safety risks, a more efficient
regulatory structure, and improved cost recovery by suppliers. Also, PTAC helps prepare the
legislative and regulatory frameworks required for divesting utility companies.

109. New IDMBRD lending support. The planned PSAC will also cover further public finance
reforms, including in the health sector and pension systems, building o n the support provided by
E M S A C 11, SOSAC 11, SITAP, and the recently closed Basic Health Project. It will introduce
structural reforms enhancing financial sustainability, and foster further fiscal and administrative
integration and rationalization across Entity and cantonal health and pension providers.
110. If
BH were to fall into the l o w case lending scenario, in FY07 the PSAC would be substituted
with a smaller IDA credit, with the objective of maintaining the policy dialogue, fostering ownership,
and strengthening institutions for intended reforms in the area o f Social Service Delivery.
111. The above-mentioned EDP has prepared the ground for an Education Restructuring Project
(ERP), which i s now planned for FY05. Vocational and higher education reform (closely linked with
E M S A C reforms) i s key to providing the BH economy with the human capital needed in the coming
years for social and economic development and European integration. The education system i s also
one of the remaining challenges for full social integration o f the country. Finally, there i s a need to
assist the authorities stem the current “brain drain” caused by the emigration (or the unwillingness to
return to BH) o f many young people.
39

112. Based o n the successful Basic Health Project, a follow-on project i s planned for FY05 which
will scale up the successful primary health care model (the so-called Family Medicine Centers),
which was piloted under BHP in partnership with Canada, and to further advance health sector
reforms. In the l o w case, a Rural Development Project would support the capacity of the
Government to invest in essential economic infrastructure and services for the sustainable
development o f rural areas.
113. Infrastructure. In support of BH’s participation in ECSEE, a Power Sector Project as part of
a horizontal Adaptable Lending (APL) for energy in Southeast Europe i s planned for FY06. As
described above, the power sector i s a potential source o f growth and export earnings for BH.
Therefore, in addition to this regional IDA project, options will be explored in the C A S period for a
possible IBRD loan for a power generation project in BH, which could either come in the form of an
IBRD enclave project or an IBRD loan guaranteed by a donor partner. The objective o f such a
project would be to allow BH to tap into i t s significant power export potential and to generate power
exports for ECSEE, while exploring innovative IBRD financing options in advance of BH’s
creditworthiness.

114. A second regional IDA project (SEE Regional 11) i s foreseen for FY07. As described above,
the power sector i s a source o f growth and export earnings for BH. The exact project scope will be
decided in F Y 0 6 depending on progress made in identification o f regional projects beneficial for
BH’s participation (potential candidates include Information and Communications Technologies ICT, Regional Water Resource Management and Regional Fiduciary Reform).
115. In addition, provided that BH meets the benchmarks for the high case lending scenario and
advances toward creditworthiness, a first IBRD project in support o f a key area o f infrastructure
would be prepared in FY07. The Bank’s Infrastructure h Energy (I&E) Strategy17 emphasizes a
number of infrastructure investments, including the importance o f strengthening the maintenance of
secondary and local roads in order to improve access to markets, and hence economic growth
prospects, in particular in rural and semi-urban areas where the majority o f BH’s poor live.
116. AAA. In infrastructure, the recently completed I&E Strategy remains the flagship of
analytical work underpinning activities in this area. A follow-up Infrastructure Study i s foreseen for
FY06, which together with an essential Debt Sustainability Analysis (FY06) will inform the option of
‘a possible F Y 0 7 IBRD project. Also, building o n the I&E Strategy, a specific Energy Sector
Strategy i s planned for FY05, which will map out the challenges and opportunities for BH in coal,
gas, hydro, and other energy areas. As described in B o x 1, support for the empowerment of youth in
BH will also be provided through a variety o f channels.

117. In FY05 a study o n Environmental Benchmarking will compare BH’s environmental
assessment systems with EU guidelines, and assess the strengths and weaknesses o f relevant agencies
for environmental management. In FY06 sector work will build o n the experience o f neighboring
pre-accession countries to identify options for assisting BH in broad-based rural development.
118. The planned Pension Reform Study (FY06) (para. 83) will build o n existing E S W and the
ongoing work under SITAP.

119. IFC. The privatization o f infrastructure sectors has taken longer than expected. IFC will
look for opportunities to support the privatization o f infrastructure projects, subject to market
appetite. To address the rapid infrastructure development needs in the Balkans, including BH, IFC i s
establishing the Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility (BID Facility) in cooperation with
U S A I D and European Donors. The BID Facility will help public sector entities attract private sector
participation and investments in infrastructure primarily in energy, transport, and the water and
sanitation sectors.
120. WBI. Capacity-enhancement programs in support o f a regional dialogue within Southeast
Europe o n the topic of regulation of infrastructure, and a program o n private participation in
infrastructure in BH, are under preparation.

C. Lending Scenarios and Triggers
121. IDA availability i s to be based on standard criteria. The last C A S Progress Report noted
that the indicative resource envelope for BH for the FY03-05 period was SDR128 m i l l i o n under IDA
13, down from SDR230 million under IDA 12. It was expected that, as o f FY05, BH would graduate
from i t s treatment as a post-conflict country and i t s IDA resource envelope would b e established
based o n standard criteria that i s approximately SDR 23 m i l l i o n per year, consistent with
performance-based IDA lending. An envelope o f SDR78 million in regular IDA lending i s therefore
foreseen for the FY05-07 CAS period, plus additional IDA funds for BH’s participation in regional
projects in accordance with IDA policy’’. Given the more constrained lending envelope, there i s an
even greater need for selectivity in the coming years. A f i r s t IBRD loan to BH i s included under the
high case scenario in FY07 to enhance the impact o f the Bank’s overall support, and would be
triggered by significant economic reforms moving BH toward creditworthiness.
122. Proposed triggers for lending. In terms o f lending triggers, BH i s currently in the base case
(see Annex 7). Ongoing base case lending over the three-year CAS period will be restricted to IDA
lending, and triggered by satisfactory reform performance. Base case lending triggers include
general triggers and triggers indicating satisfactory year-on-year reform performance: satisfactory
portfolio performance (no significant deterioration in the IDA portfolio), satisfactory macroeconomic
performance (as evidenced by staying o n track with the IMF program), and satisfactory M T D S
implementation. Base case lending would be strongly performance based and centered around
programmatic adjustment lending (PSAC) support for public sector reform and private sector
development. Adjustment lending would make up about 40-45 percent o f IDA lending, reflecting the
authorities’ emphasis o n significant structural reforms in the coming years as expressed in the
MTDS. In addition, the base case also contains selective investment operations in the form of a
Health Scale-up Project, the Education Reform Project, and two regional IDA projects, the first in
support of BH’s participation in ECSEE, and the second yet to be identified.

123. Specific high case lending triggers are outlined in Table 5, and reflect the necessary
reform progress to move BH towards debt sustainability. As a high case for the Bank
program, this CAS retains the medium-term macroeconomic full reform scenario as envisioned
in the MTDS. As noted above, this scenario i s characterized by strong and continued fiscal
discipline to ensure p o l i c y consistency with the currency board arrangement, leading to faster
economic growth and a more rapid increase in domestic savings than under the base case
scenario. These trends, combined with a reduced reliance o n debt-creating capital inflows,

IDA

lending will be on modified IDA terms o f 20 years maturity with 10 year grace period.

systems (public and private) operational,
linking wage setting to productivity.

adopted and satisfactory implementation
progress, consistent with the MTDS.

124. H i g h case lending will depend on attainment o f debt sustainability and fulfillment of
five key reform triggers, which collectively demonstrate important achievements underpinning
full reform. These reform triggers focus o n the successful implementation o f key policy changes
which several recent Bank analyses have shown to be particularly crucial for enhancing BH’s debt
sustainability. The first reform trigger, the establishment o f the ITA and operationalization of the
VAT, would demonstrate that (State and Entity) Governments had agreed and were implementing a
significant reform to the fiscal architecture o f the country which shares revenues in a unified
framework depending upon expenditure requirements at each level o f government. These steps
would indicate that a major political hurdle to developing a unified tax structure across the whole of
BH and the consolidation o f single economic space had been overcome, and directly enhance BH’s
debt sustainability by strengthening revenue collection and promoting domestic savings. The second
reform trigger, that one hundred companies have filed for bankruptcy, would demonstrate that clear
progress had been made in a k e y element o f the overall enterprise revitalization agenda, namely that
a significant amount o f business exit i s taking place. As enhanced debt sustainability will require a
medium- to long-term increase in domestic private savings, and as the current l o w domestic savings
are strongly linked to loss-making enterprises, these reforms will send a crucial signal that
mechanisms for containing such losses are in fact functioning and available to creditors. The third
reform trigger would be the reduction o f (i)
non-interest recurrent public spending as a share o f GDP
from around 42.1 percent in 2003 to n o more than 38 percent o f GDP by 2006; and (ii)
the share o f
the wage bill in total non-interest recurrent spending from about 36 percent in 2002 to no more than
32 percent. This would show that the weight o f public expenditure in the economy had been
significantly adjusted downwards allowing space for the private sector to grow, and the composition
of public expenditure had been significantly restructured. The fourth reform trigger would be
achieved when newly harmonized public and private sector wage determination systems are in place
and operational (see also paras. 55 and 94). This significant step toward ensuring that wage setting i s
linked to productivity will be crucial for improving the competitiveness o f BH’s economy. Under
42

BH’s currency board arrangement, a more flexible labor market will be one o f the main means o f
enhancing the economy’s resilience to shocks. For these reasons, achievement o f the noted trigger
will be central to improving BH’s macroeconomic sustainability. The fifth reform trigger would be
achieved when an affordable domestic public debt settlement plan, at 10% o f outstanding claims
consistent with the MTDS, has been adopted and satisfactory implementation i s underway. This
would indicate the removal o f a significant obstacle to settling these outstanding claims in a fiscally
responsible w a y and thus enhance the prospects for maintaining public debt at sustainable levels.
Fulfillment o f these reform triggers, together with demonstrable debt sustainability, would allow, for
the first time since Dayton, modest IBRD financing with the objective o f achieving greater impact in
the overall Bank-supported program.

125. I n the event that base case triggers are not met, lending will shift to the low case, as per
the lending table (see Table 6). The l o w case would reduce the regular and the additional regional
IDA envelope by more than 50 percent. Further differences from the base case scenario would be a
shift from adjustment lending to focused capacity-building projects in Public Sector Reform and
Social Service Delivery, which would enable IDA to maintain a policy dialogue and build ownership
for the reform agenda. In addition, a Rural Development Investment Project in FY07 would address
rural poverty in this low-performance scenario.

D. Implementing the CAS
Partnership and Donor Coordination

126. Following the end of the conflict in late 1995, BH experienced a generous inflow of
financial support from the international community. The reconstruction program, mobilized
approximately US$5 billion and focused primarily on physical reconstruction and rehabilitation,
dominated by infrastructure reconstruction. More than half was spent on restoration o f services in
the following sectors: power, industry, transport and communications and water supply. Additional
resources were used for interventions in the social sectors, including health, social protection and
education. Demining (landmines), agriculture and financial sector also significantly benefited from
the program, as did budget support, institutional development and capacity building.
127. However, international assistance began to decline after completion o f the above
program. A hrther sharp decline i s expected in 2004, with annual assistance flows estimated to fall
from about US$750 million to US$300 million,’’ and the decline i s expected to continue. The type
of assistance has also changed significantly, with i t s focus shifting from reconstruction to support for
policy reforms and technical assistance.20 In light o f declining donor assistance and increased
selectivity, close donor coordination becomes more important than ever, in order to avoid
programming duplication and secure maximum possible impact o f scarce resources. Important
features of the period ahead w i l l be a growing EC role in light o f BH’s participation in the SAP, and
a greater focus o f donor assistance on supporting BH’s implementation o f the M T D S and European
Partnership priorities within the SAP. The Bank will continue to play a major role in the three CAS
pillars. W h i l e the Bank will take the lead in the three pillars, utilizing i t s comparative advantage in
advancing structural reforms, together with the IMF. Other partners will provide complementary
assistance essential to supporting the M T D S (see also CDF Matrix in Annex lo), particularly in the
form o f technical assistance grants for capacity building.
128. Following the preparation of the EU Feasibility Study and inclusion o f i t s findings and
recommendations into the MTDS, and the EC approval o f the European Partnership for BH, the
reform process in BH w i l l be strongly guided by the SAP (see Annex 2). Against this background, it
i s of importance for the Bank to closely coordinate i t s activities in BH in particular with those of the
EC. Areas o f deepened future cooperation and coordination with the EC under the new CAS are
listed in Table 7.

129. A renewed emphasis on government-led donor coordination should help maximize
coherence and progress. Within an environment of waning external resources, even more effective
donor coordination, focused on supporting M T D S implementation and the process o f moving closer
towards the EU, will become a growing imperative. One objective o f this CAS i s therefore to
support the development of a CDF-style approach to donor coordination, helping Government to take
the lead role. Dovetailing the Bank’s approach in support o f BH’s chosen donor coordination
mechanisms, with an emphasis on M T D S implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and SAP
progress, will be essential to fostering Government ownership and lasting results. Related capacity
building measures will be an overarching theme of Bank support. This will also require a
strengthened role for the Country Office in Sarajevo.

Portfolio Management

131. Since 1996, 51 IDA projects have been approved. O f total IDA commitments o f
US$1,101.3 million, US$794 million has been disbursed as o f July 15, 2004. The current BH
portfolio consists o f 21 projects with an undisbursed balance o f US$307.3 million. Given the
relatively large portfolio compared to the level o f new commitments in the CAS period, effective and
timely portfolio implementation will be key to achieving the results laid out in the results-oriented
framework (Annex 9). As long as base case reforms are met net flows from the Bank to BH will
remain positive.
132. The Bank’s share o f BH’s external debt remains high, but i s projected to decline.
Current BH debt indicators are among the best in SEE and the external debt situation seems
manageable.21 Although, the projected Bank share o f BH’s total external debt stood at close to 50
percent in 2002, it i s projected to decline by 9 percentage points by 2013. The ratio o f the Bank’s

debt service to total BH debt service i s also expected to decrease, albeit from a high o f 37 percent to
a s t i l l high 30 percent. Debt service to IBRD2*as a share o f total public debt service (currently at 28
percent) i s above the IBRD exposure guideline (20 percent), but i s projected to drop to an acceptable
level by 2009. Moreover, the IBRD debt service as a share o f exports i s expected to remain w e l l
within the guideline o f 4 percent.
133. The overall quality of the portfolio remains strong. Quality indicators and Quality
Assistance Group (QAG) and Operational Evaluation Department (OED) ratings o f the BH portfolio
have consistently been above Bank and E C A averages. There i s currently one problem project (i.e.
PTAC to be restructured, see para. 84) and no projects at risk. Continued close monitoring will be
necessary to maintain this track record. The FY04 CPPR also underlined the need to accelerate and
deepen the process o f mainstreaming self-standing Project Management Units (PMUs), which were
crucial and highly effective in the post-conflict environment, into proper government institutions,
while safeguarding for fiduciary risks. Progress towards fostering Government ownership and
enhancing institutional capacity, initially defined in terms of gradual mainstreaming into a single,
State level PMU (e.g. TTFSE), one P M U serving both Entities (e.g. SoZid Waste Management) o r
shared implementation (e.g. SESP), must n o w increasingly entail fully integrating Bank operations
into government structures (e.g. Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery). The Bank will support
this process by helping the authorities to overcome major capacity constraints by: (a) facilitating the
analysis and development o f mechanisms necessary to achieve greater consistency in PMU staff
remuneration; (b) identifying options for outsourcing certain fknctions such as financial management
and procurement; (c) establishing basic standards for operating procedures; and (d) fostering
government leadership in policy-making. Furthermore, within the Bank's Country Office (CO), the
portfolio management function has been decentralized t o facilitate effective achievement o f these
objectives. A CO-led team also monitors the implementation o f the CPPR action plan.

V. R i s k s
134. The level and composition of risks in the BH program have fundamentally changed
since i t s inception in late 1995. With the major post-conflict reconstruction hurdles n o w overcome,
medium-term risks are judged to be moderate. Nonetheless, with significant state building measures
outstanding, as w e l l as EU accession and economic transition challenges ahead, the BH program s t i l l
faces a number o f internal and external risks in the C A S period.
135. BH internal risks. A weakening political commitment to reform, especially in light of
municipal (in the fall o f 2004) and national elections (2006), could cause slippages in reforms and
lead to delays in the SAP process, and in the process o f meeting M T D S action plan targets. There i s
also a risk that the proposed reform package will not produce growth and employment in the short
term, thereby making political acceptance o f reforms more difficult. Social and economic pressures
are likely to increase, and m a y inhibit the governments' progress on the reform agenda, particularly
the goals of reducing the share of the public sector in GDP, implementing the domestic debt action
plan, accelerating privatization, creating a better climate for private investment, and reducing the
current account deficit. The 2002 election and the following government-building period effectively
caused a nine- month hiatus in reforms. It will be very important to avoid a reoccurrence of such
events after upcoming elections. The current ruling coalitions are strained, particularly in the face of
When the Board approved BH's IBRD membership in 1996, it also approved the consolidation of BH's existing
debt to IBRD (inherited from SFRY) into three loans. The current outstanding principal o n these loans i s $534
million, or 7.7 percent o f BH's estimated 2003 GDP. BH has maintained a good track record on servicing these
debts.
22

46

the significant reform agenda and the ongoing divisive constitutional debate, which, in turn, could
lead t o setbacks in the state-building agenda. Successful implementation o f the M T D S will depend
o n b o t h the commitment and the ability of State, Entity, and cantonal governments to w o r k together
toward common goals. However, currently, government structures are decentralized, fragmented,
and suffer f r o m severe capacity constraints. A slippage into the l o w case m a y also lead t o net
negative transfers from the W o r l d Bank, and a more complicated policy dialogue with the authorities.

136. As mitigating measures, the economic, social, and political benefits o f EU accession,
membership in WTO and the NATO Partnership for Peace program, and the prospects for improved
livelihoods for a l l citizens o f BH will have t o be communicated effectively by the BH leadership to
the broader public. The wide M T D S consultations have already raised a high level o f awareness of
the reform program and helped build an initial consensus around it. The Bank’s assistance through
portfolio implementation, for instance in the areas o f active labor market interventions, social safety
nets and support to agriculture and urban development, in particular targeted at vulnerable areas and
the poor, will also help mitigate these risks. In addition, m u c h institutional strengthening will be
needed to enable the authorities to implement the ambitious reform agenda. For the Bank this group
of risks also implies that more up-front political economic analysis will need t o be undertaken prior
t o committing assistance for any activity. Given the l i m i t e d absorptive capacity t o reform, the
political costs entailed in any given reform will need t o b e carefully weighed against growth and
poverty reduction benefits o f such reforms, and be seen in the wider context o f BH’s overall reform
agenda, using this as a framework for prioritizing h t u r e areas o f assistance. Lastly, the presence of
SFOR and OHR, as w e l l as the incentive of European accession, will continue to act as significant
stabilizers.
137.

External risks. Further risks m a y arise from BH’s macroeconomic position, and threats to

i t s stability that would emerge ifthe external environment were to deteriorate (that is, through

persistently sluggish demand for BH’s exports, lower foreign direct investment or non-debt creating
capital inflows, o r a faster than anticipated decline in external assistance). The resulting deflationary
pressures could slow the momentum of recovery and reform, make i t more difficult for BH to
implement i t s MTDS, and place pressures o n employment and the currency board through a tighter
overall balance o f payments. The planned Consultative Group meeting in the second h a l f o f 2004
will b e an opportunity for BH to make a strong case for continued support for M T D S
implementation. A further risk could be an overly ambitious international community, which, in the
aggregate, could overestimate BH’s absorptive capacity t o reform. A coordinated approach, up-front
analysis, and effective communication within the international community will mitigate this risk. A
further external risk could emanate from a slowdown o f the overall EU accession process. Speedy
implementation o f the reform action plans by BH authorities could mitigate this risk. Finally,
regional instability, for instance triggered by events in S a M and Kosovo, could adversely impact BH.
This risk can be mitigated by continued social and economic reforms in a l l Southeast European
countries, and by making progress toward EU accession and strengthened regional cooperation and
integration.

BH’s Progress Towards European Integration
EU Stabilization and Association Process. The Thessaloniki European Council o f 19-20 June,
2003, reiterated i t s determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective o f the
Western Balkan countries and stated that “the Westem Balkans countries will become an integral
part of the EU, once they meet the established criteria.” It endorsed the Council’s Conclusions o f 16
June 2003 o n the Western Balkans including he annex “The Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western
Balkans: moving toward European integration,” which aims at further intensifying relations between
the EU and the Western Balkans24, building also on practices used in the enlargement process, inter
alia through the introduction o f European Partnerships. The Commission was invited to submit a
first set of European Partnerships (EP) to the Council for approval with the N e x t Annual Reports o n
the Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) by March 2004. Based on the third annual
Reports on the Western Balkans, the EC approved the first ever European Partnerships for the
Western Balkans on March 30,2004.
Modeled o n the Accession Partnerships developed to prepare past aspirants to EU membership, the
EPs represent a milestone in the relations between the EU and the Western Balkan countries, giving
the SAP a new dimension through the addition o f elements that have proved successful with
candidates for EU membership. They are tailored to each country’s specific needs, setting out
priorities for the short-term (12-24 months) and the medium-term (3-4 years). The EPs help
governments concentrate reform effort and available resources where they are most needed. The
competent authorities are expected to respond with detailed plans for the implementation o f i t s EP
priorities, setting out the concrete measures to be taken, a timetable, and demonstrating what human
and financial resources will be devoted to the tasks involved. The priorities identified in the EPs will
also influence the allocation o f the financial assistance from the EU.
The aspiration o f eventual integration into the EU provides the overall institutional and legal
framework for economic development in BH, as stated in the M T D S . The country’s strategy for
economic growth and poverty reduction is, therefore, closely integrated with the EU’s SAP. BH’s
first step in this process came in early 2000 when work began o n a “Road Map” o f 18 priority reform
steps. The Road M a p was “substantially completed” in September, 2002, and at that stage the
European Commission initiated work on a “Feasibility Study” aimed at assessing BH’s readiness to
take next steps toward European integration. In March, 2003, a questionnaire covering all sectors
relevant to a future Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) was given to the BH Directorate
for European Integration. BH’s response was discussed with the Commission in a series o f working
groups between M a y and September, 2003.
E C Feasibilitv Study. The Study concluded that BH has made important progress since the 1990s,
but it s t i l l suffers from significant structural weaknesses. Among i t s achievements are: establishing
democratic procedures, improving the rule of law, stabilizing the macro-economic situation and
bringing sectoral reforms closer in line with European standards. Still, many fundamental reforms
remain incomplete: full government accountability must be demonstrated; economic reform requires
consolidation; and, the country’s technical and administrative capacities require further
upgrading. BH’s core challenge, therefore, remains that o f building a self-sustaining state able to
integrate further into EU structures.
The Western Balkans include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo (as defined by the UN Security Council Resolution 1244).

On the condition that BH makes significant progress in a number o f areas identified as priorities for
action, the EC concluded that it hopes to be able to recommend the opening o f Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations in the following year. In 2004, therefore, the EC
recommends that BH take action to make satisfactory progress with respect to key conditions which
fall within five broad categories:
Comply with existing conditionality:
0
Compliance with existing conditionality and international obligations, including the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia;
0
Effective human rights provisions, notably by taking steps to meet BH’s Council o f Europe
post-accession criteria.
Deliver more effective government at State level:
0
More effective governance, notably by fully implementing the L a w o n the Council o f Ministers
and the L a w o n Ministries, and convening meetings o f the C O M and parliament with sufficient
regularity to tackle government business expeditiously, ensuring that new State ministries and
bodies become properly operational, including the Directorate for European Integration;

Build the rule o f law:
0
Making judiciary more effective by adopting legislation establishing a single High Judicial and
Prosecutorial Council, and properly staffing and funding the State Court;
0
Tackling crime, especially organized crime, building State-level enforcement capacity;
0
Managing asylum and migration by establishing adequate administrative structures.
Proceed with economic reform:
0
Improving budget legislation through the customs and taxation reform
which include
implementation o f the recommendations o f the Indirect Tax Policy Commission, full
parliamentary adoption of the L a w o n Indirect Tax Authority, and speeding up the introduction o f
the VAT;
0
Improving budget management by adopting and starting to implement a budget l a w covering
multi-annual budget planning and forecasting;
0
Develop reliable statistics and implement fully the L a w o n Statistics;
0
Establish a comprehensive and consistent comprehensive trade policy;
0
Integrate the electricity market by implementing relevant Entity Action Plans;
0
Develop BH single economic space, including the creation o f a single business registration
environment.
Strengthen institutional capacity
0

0

Create a more effective public administration including developing a comprehensive and costestimated action plan for public administration reform;
Advance European integration by adopting legislation in line with European standards that
ensure the long-term viability of a financially and editorially independent State-wide public
broadcasting system.

Progress under the Feasibility Study will b e assessed by the E C in the second h a l f o f 2004 to
establish whether BH meets the conditions to start negotiating an SAA, within the overall framework
provided by the European Partnership priorities

Bosnia and Herzegovina: Public Information Notice
On February 25, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article I V consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH).

Background
Economic activity weakened somewhat in 2003 while inflation remained low. Real GDP growth slowed
to an estimated 3.5 percent from 5.5 percent in 2002 and 4.4 percent in 2001, as manufacturing has all but
stood s t i l l and drought has cut apcultural output by one-fifth. Profitability appears to have strengthened
in the Republika Srpska while deteriorating further in the Federation. Consumer prices, anchored by the
currency board, were unchanged in January-September 2003 compared to the same period o f 2002.
Credit to households soared in 2002, fueled by a rapid increase in bank deposits following bank
privatization and reverse currency substitution as euro notes were introduced on January 1, 2002. This
boosted imports and raised the current account deficit by about 2.5 percentage points o f GDP toward
19 percent. After a policy tightening in 2003-a reform o f required reserves regime, strengthened
application o f bank liquidity, and foreign exchange exposure regulations-credit to the private sector has
begun to decelerate and the current account to strengthen. W i t h slower growth in credit, the lagged impact
of a real appreciation of the Serbian dinar in 2002, and further fiscal consolidation, the external balance
strengthened by at least 1 percentage point o f GDP in 2003.
Fiscal consolidation continued by about 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2003, t a h n g the balance to a small
surplus. With revenue on track, both Entity governments kept a tight lid o n spending. Spending at State,
Cantonal, and extra-budgetary fund levels has also remained under control, with the latter two on track to
achieve balanced budgets. The Entities continued to reconstitute into the escrow accounts funds spent in
2002 for severance payments under the demobilization program.
An impressive reform agenda i s underway. First, a framework law o n indirect taxation was recently
adopted that will strengthen the fiscal system by providing for immediate establishment o f a single
indirect tax and customs administration and for indirect tax harmonization throughout BH. I t also
establishes joint Entity and State decision-making for indirect tax policy. This package underlies plans to
replace sales tax with value-added tax (VAT) in 2005-06. Second, a plan has been announced to
restructure unsustainable domestic claims o n the government o f more than 200 percent o f GDP. Third,
major defense reforms are anticipated for 2004, centralizing command and control structures, continuing
demobilization, and facilitating accession to NATO’s partnership for peace. Fourth, the judicial system i s
being overhauled, including a nearly completed exercise to selectively reappoint judges and a new system
of commercial courts. Fifth, since mid-2003, bank regulators have stepped up enforcement o f key
liquidity and foreign exchange exposure regulations, with full enforcement expected by mid-2004. At the
same time, the authorities’ six-month “Action Plan” o f structural reforms signals their increasing capacity
to take the lead in economic policymalung. Furthermore, an EU feasibility study has been completed,
setting the stage for EU accession negotiations to commence.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress during 2003 in maintaining growth despite a
severe drought, as well as the maintenance o f price stability, the achievement o f a sizable fiscal
consolidation, a decline in the extemal current account deficit, and an increase in intemational reserves;
51

all of which signaled the increasing strength o f the currency board. They also noted progress in
institutional and structural reform, including the installation o f a new central bank board, the development
of plans to reform indirect taxes and defense spending, and to restructure domestic claims on the
government. Directors cautioned, however, that many challenges remain in maintaining macroeconomic
stability and deepening structural reforms, in particular in strengthening governmental institutions and
corporate revitalization. These challenges are compounded by an eventual decline in aid inflows and the
need to continue absorbing refugees.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain a strong fiscal stance in 2004, which they
viewed as contributing to a sustainable fiscal position and a reduction in the external current account
deficit, and bolstering the viability of the currency board. They cautioned, however, that further fiscal
tightening might be required in view of uncertain trends in the balance o f payments and domestic savings.
They regretted the political and procedural difficulties in approving the 2004 budget that had led to a
significant delay in completing the fourth review under the Stand-By Arrangement, and pointed to the
challenges associated with improving fiscal policy coordination and containing current spending,
especially on wages and pensions.
Directors were encouraged that a rapid expansion in bank credit i s being contained, but stressed that
further restraint i s necessary for macroeconomic stability. In this respect, they highlighted the importance
of firm implementation o f monetary policies and regulations introduced in mid-2003 that altered reserve
requirements, and tightened bank core capital requirements and foreign exchange exposure regulations.
They noted that if the central bank’s responsibilities are extended to banking supervision, the authorities
should ensure that the quality of regulation i s maintained during the transition period. They encouraged
the authorities to put in place effective Anti-Money Laundering /Combating the Financing o f Terrorism
(AMLKFT) legslation.
Directors emphasized the critical importance of progressing o n a broad range o f structural reforms in the
private and public sector. They endorsed steps to improve governance o f state enterprises, including by
reinvigorating privatization, and to put in place commercial legislation, including a bankruptcy code, and
commercial courts. They called for the authorities to move quickly to structure voluntary debt workouts
for state enterprises involving all creditors, and to curb regulatory, legal, and tax impediments to business
development. They also saw a need simultaneously to reform labor market institutions to induce a more
efficient use o f labor. In this context, they strongly encouraged reviewing wage and severance
arrangements in order to moderate wage growth and attain a higher rate o f employment growth.
Directors emphasized the importance of strengthening fiscal policy and institutions. A top priority i s to
develop the Indirect Tax Authority, which would administer the planned value added tax, and to consider
extending its responsibilities to coordinate fiscal policy in general. They also supported tax reform to
reduce the burden o f taxation, especially on labor, and stressed the need for greater efficiency in current
spending to make room for public investment. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to restructure
domestic claims on government and to reduce their net burden, and stressed the importance o f
implementingdebt restructuring without delay, thus paving the way for accession to A r t i c l e VI11 status.
Directors observed that deficiencies in statistics hindered macroeconomic policy malung and analysis,
including in running the currency board, and the analysis o f broader economic developments. They
highlighted the need for diligent attention to strengthening data collection.
Directors regretted the unilateral decision to delay, even briefly, full implementation o f the regional Free
Trade Agreements, and underscored that this might impede the country’s accession to the WTO. A few
Directors also noted the importance and possible revenue consequences o f reducing tariffs.

Annex 4:
Anti-corruption and AML/CFT Activities in BH
Anti-corruption
Following the Diagnostic Surveys of Corruption report prepared by the W o r l d Bank in 200 1, BH
governments adopted a comprehensive Anti-corruption Action Plan in February 2002. The plan
envisions actions to be taken o n three main fronts: legislative, institutional, and educational. T w o
years later, progress i s mixed: some o f the key activities, mainly legislative and some
institutional, have been completed; some o f them are ongoing, while educational activities have
not yet received the deserved attention. The importance o f these activities, however has been
reacknowledged in the MTDS. This annex summarizes the main achievements and actions that
remain to be taken.
Legislative Component

k Law on Civil ServiceBublic AdministratiodCorruption Prevention: Civil Service and
Public Administration Laws have been adopted at State and Entity levels. Civil Service

Agencies have been established at the State and RS level, and the process o f establishment
and operationalization o f the agency in the FBH i s ongoing. A comprehensive strategy for
statewide public administration reform shall be prepared by September 2004. In terms o f
the L a w o n Preventing Corruption, implementation o f other Laws (that is, Criminal Law)
will provide mechanisms to deal with corruption in general.

k Law on Conflict of Interest: The L a w has been adopted at the State level, and i s being

implemented by the election commission. In the meantime, some amendments to improve
the L a w are in the parliamentary adoption process. Until the Entity laws o n “Conflict o f
Interest’’ have been adopted (they are currently being prepared), the issue i s addressed by
a State-level law, and implemented by BH’s election commission. The Bank’s E M S A C i s
addressing the issue o f securing sufficient funding for the implementation o f the Statelevel law.

k Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law: All the appropriate provisions have been

included in the Criminal L a w and Criminal Procedure L a w at a l l levels (State, both
Entities, and Brcko District), including those dealing with the responsibility o f legal
entities for criminal offenses. B o t h laws have been adopted at a l l levels and
implementation started during 2003.

k Law on public procurement: The final draft prepared with the assistance o f the EU and
supported by the Bank’s E M S A C i s in the parliamentary adoption process at the State
level, as a single law governing procurement throughout BH.

Institutional Component

k Courts and Prosecution Offices. Envisioned state-level institutions (Court and

Prosecutor’s office) have been established, and the L a w o n Judicial and Prosecutorial
fbnctions was adopted by the Entities. Work o f the established institutions to date was
deemed satisfactory by the local authorities. Further activities in this area are envisioned
in the MTDS as well, and include implementation o f the adopted legislation, adoption o f
amendments to the L a w o n Obligations (to be harmonized with EU standards), and
improvements to the property legislation. In terms o f further institutional activities, the
M T D S commits to the establishment o f departments for the settlement o f commercial
53

>
>

disputes in 16 first-instance courts BH-wide, and continued education o f judges to carry
out the w o r k in these departments. The M T D S cites the need to strengthen sanctions for
those engaged in bribery, especially lawyers, and the associated Code o f Conduct for
lawyers, and to bolster enforcement.
Tax and Customs Reform: The Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA) has been formally
established and the Director has been appointed. Reform o f customs and the tax system
will continue in the future, with technical assistance provided by the EC.
Supreme Audit Institutions. Audit offices are supported by the current work o f Swedish
National Audit Office (SNAO), financed by SIDA. S I D A and S N A O also envision
support in further development o f the role o f parliaments in reaction to and processing o f
audit reports.

P Educational Component. These activities seem to have been somewhat neglected, except

in individual cases that have received donor support. However, i t seems that there i s full
awareness o f the need for education, both in specific, technical areas, and in the education

>

o f the general public.

Other Activities. Initial inclusion o f the media and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) in the anticorruption processes has been accomplished through the M T D S
process. Public discussions and hearings were held with NGOs, especially in the context
of preparing the Anti-Corruption Action Plan. The M T D S notes the need for continuation
of this dialogue, and the important role for NGOs and the media in the ongoing fight
against corruption. Other anticorruption actions specified in the M T D S include: the
establishment o f mechanisms for citizen reports o f corruption cases and for processing
these cases; and strengthening the Ombudsmen function at all levels.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing Terrorism
An AML/CFT l a w was drafled during 2003-2004, enacted by Parliament o n M a y 4, 2004, and
will become fully effective by Dec 2004. Implementing international standards for the prevention
and detection o f money laundering and terrorist financing i s currently a rather high priority in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
During the past year, the OHR has coordinated among donor
countries/organizations an Action Plan to implement international AML/CFT standards. As a
result, BH authorities are currently seeking the necessary training to build capacity among
responsible officials to establish and operationalize the financial intelligence unit ("FIU" i s the
unit which receives and analyzes reports o f suspicious transactions).

In support o f these efforts, the Bank and the OHR have designed and are in the process o f
delivering a series o f Training Sessions (via GDLN) focused o n implementing international
A M L / C F T standards to approximately 80 BH officials. Using AML/CFT expert/officials from
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, a l l training presentations, Q/A and discussions have been conducted
in local language, a great benefit to many officials. Donor countries, organizations and some
neighboring countries are supporting the efforts o f BH to implement international AML/CFT
standards, with good progress, although this work needs to continue.

With respect to BH C A S objectives, AML/CFT work (and full implementation o f international
standards) would play an important role in support Pillars 1 and 2 as follows:

54

Pillar 1: Improving Public Finance & Strengthening Institutions,
Money laundering and public corruption are overlapping and integrated concepts, as money
laundering i s often connected to public corruption, whether in paying bribes to officials to 'look
the other way' or in actual laundering o f criminally obtained proceeds by officials themselves,
Therefore, strengthening capacity and legal mechanisms for the prevention and detection of
money laundering results in a decrease in corruption and bribery. Money laundering i s
particularly prevalent in countries, like BH, which are undergoing privatization processes, where
there i s little transparency into the privatization and public procurement processes, where
trafficking in drugs, other commodities and humans are prevalent, and where the economy i s
cash-based. Officials in BH are well aware o f the problems o f corruption as illustrated by the
Anti-Corruption Action Plan o f Feb. 2003 (see para. 24), as w e l l as the high level o f organized
crime activity, particularly smuggling and trafficking. As a result, BH officials agree that
implementing international standards to detect and prevent money laundering needs to be a
priority.
Pillar 2: Promoting Sustainable Private-Sector-Led Growth.

High levels o f money laundering as w e l l as organized crime and financial crime clearly harm the
business environment, damage sustainable private sector growth and drive away potential foreign
investment. Although money laundering can appear to be a 'victimless' crime, i t s effects are quite
serious, as the lack o f prevention and detection mechanisms attracts further criminal activity, and
creates a hostile business environment for honest entrepreneurs whose aim i s sustainable business
development, which in turn contributes to the longer-term health and stability o f the economy.
Implementing AML/CFT standards in BH need not necessarily be a long-term project. As a
matter o f fact, much has been done already, and it i s evident there i s currently sufficient political
will and momentum to meet international standards completely over the next two years. This goal
i s considered realistic, as some neighboring countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia), as w e l l as other
donor countries (USA) and institutions (World Bank, IMF & EU), support these efforts. BH i s
being sponsored for membership in the Egmont Group by Croatia and SAM, and i t i s anticipated
that BH will be accepted as a full member o f Egmont in 2005.

55

Annex 5:
Promoting Regional Integration within Southeast Europe through the BH C A S
The “Regional Framework Paper”25 lays out the Bank’s approach to working within the Southeast
Europe (SEE) region. As the paper points out, individual CASs will remain the appropriate
instrument for setting priorities for Bank programs, and for agreeing lending and non-lending
activities with our clients. However, it i s important to also frame this C A S in the regional context
o f SEE. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has long stretches o f land border with Croatia and with
SaM, shares significant watersheds, and has extensive energy, trade, and transport linkages with
both countries and beyond. BH’s diverse citizenry, historically, had very close ties to all parts of
the former Yugoslavia. In addition, since Croatia i s further advanced in i t s EU accession process,
BH will become a direct neighbor o f the EU, with a l l the benefits that come with having close
access to the world’s largest market, as soon as Croatia will j o i n the EU.
There are two broad types o f benefits of joint activities with countries in SEE. The f i r s t i s
activities with cross-border externalities and economies o f scale. M a n y interventions have benefits
beyond the boundaries o f the country in which they are implemented. Taking these potentially
large effects explicitly into account when designing and implementing interventions can
significantly increase the benefits of these interventions. Similarly, the costs and benefits o f
numerous investment and policy interventions can be affected by their scale, so that costs to the
country and the Bank can be reduced and benefits increased. Relevant examples for BH are (a) the
planned participation in South East European Regional Energy Market (ECSEE) and in a
proposed Bank-supported horizontal APL, (b) the ongoing Trade and Transport Facilitation in
Southeast Europe (TTFSE) project, (c) a proposed Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant to
improve the water quality of the Bosnia and Neretva Rivers as part o f a broader Black
SealDanube nutrient-reduction program, (d) a proposed GEF grant to support river basin and
ecosystem management o f the Neretva and Trebisnjica rivers and their delta, and (e) the Poverty
Reduction Forum for SEE, led by World Bank Institute in partnership with numerous partners.
The second type o f activity benefits from “scaling-up” o f successful interventions that have
worked in other SEE countries. A good example for BH i s the support provided to small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) by the South East Europe Enterprise Development (SEED)facility, a
multidonor partnership led by I F C with headquarters in Sarajevo. SEED (see also B o x 6) provides
technical assistance to SMEs and institutions serving their needs, such as business associations.
BH has already benefited from successful experiences o f small-and-medium-enterprise support in
other SEE countries, for example, in the area o f leasing regulation. “Scaling-up” can also take the
form o f regional studies o f issues of common concern for countries in SEE. For example, the
Bank i s undertaking regional Environmental Sector W o r k (ESW) in the areas o f trade, public
expenditure, growth, environmental regulations and capacity, telecommunications, power, and
transport.
The World Bank Group’s program in BH aims to maximize these benefits and therefore
contribute to the consolidation o f stability and prosperity in BH, and in the region.

BH Poverty Diagnostics and Agenda
General Findings. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Poverty Assessment (PA)26,completed in 2003,
provides the most comprehensive analysis o f household living standards since the end o f the war.
Using as i t s primary source the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) data from late
200 1,the study found significant levels of poverty in BH, though n o measured extreme poverty. I t
also found significant variations in poverty rates, both between and within Entities. Overall, about
20 percent o f BH’s population i s living below the poverty line, o r a consumption threshold,, but
with a further significant share clustering not far above the line and considered vulnerable. The
k e y results o n poverty in BH from the Poverty Assessment are reported in Table 1 below.

Consistent with this finding, inequality in BH was n o t high, as demonstrated through Table 2

While these findings might conclude that the post-conflict recovery effort was relatively
successful in mitigating pervasive poverty, further analysis highlights the vulnerability of a
large share of the population. In addition to the people living below the poverty line, another 30
percent o f the population i s estimated t o be near poor. Since the L S M S placed considerable
emphasis o n non-income dimensions o f poverty, it i s k n o w n that nearly 70 percent are poor in
at least one dimension of poverty. Moreover, the PA concludes that there i s no single root cause
o f poverty; rather what makes people poor in BH i s a combination o f misfortunes, including l o w
education, unemployment geographic variables. Table 3 provides a summary poverty profile for
BH, including Entity level data.

The PA analysis clearly indicates that the relatively small amount currently spent on social
welfare in BH i s not used efficiently. Comparisons with other CEE and SEE countries reveal that
the efficiency (measure o f targeting) of the system in BH i s among the lowest in the region,
with only Russia being less efficient. Effectiveness o f the system in terms o f poverty reduction i s
even lower, with less than 5 percent of the poverty gap in BH eliminated by targeted transfers.
The analysis suggests not only that aggregate allocations need to be increased, but that reforms o f
both financing and targeting o f benefits need to be part o f the reform package. This i s consistent
with the direction o f reforms supported under SOSACII.
Prior to the LSMS, there were no consistent, representative and comprehensive household data for
BH as a whole. Earlier surveys did not allow generalization o f results, nor did they collect
detailed information on material living conditions. Therefore, no historic trends can be
inferred, as the resulting poverty and inequality estimates deviated substantially f r o m estimates
based o n a detailed household consumption survey such as the LSMS.

‘

The Poverty Agenda and M T D S Implementation. The M T D S poverty diagnostic i s grounded in
the Bank’s P N L S M S . As in the PA, Government’s strategy highlights that about one-fifth o f
Bosnians live below the poverty line, although there i s n o more extreme poverty in the country.
An additional 30 percent o f the population lives close to the poverty line and i s vulnerable to
falling below the line with small declines in income. Adding non-income dimensions o f poverty
(education, health, housing, and human rights), a staggering 72 percent o f adults are poor in at
least one dimension o f well-being, and vulnerability levels (that is, the risk o f falling into poverty)
are also high. The M T D S poverty profile shows significant regional disparities in poverty largely
centered o n rural and small semi-urban communities that were most adversely affected by
conflict. Children (particularly those under 5 years o f age), women, displaced persons and
returnees, persons with l o w levels o f education, and the unemployed appear to be at particular
risk. However, while unemployment i s an important determinant o f poverty, about 60 percent o f
the poor are living in families where someone i s employed, and as such are “the working poor.”
Given broader data limitations, however, the M T D S poverty diagnostic does not currently include
analysis of the distribution o f income and assets and i t s link to poverty.

T o date, BH does not have a poverty monitoring system and the survey data on which such
monitoring could be based. Since i t s completion in 2001, the L S M S i s the only survey in BH
which has generated regionally representative, multi-sectoral and robust data o n poverty. A
principal challenge for the authorities in the medium-term, therefore, i s to develop and sustain
BH’s o w n capacity to produce and maintain reliable social statistics, as w e l l as to systematically
support public policy formulation o n the basis o f such statistics. More specifically, in order to
facilitate effective M T D S implementation, monitoring and evaluation, poverty diagnostics need to
be more robust and the data maintained.
In response to this apparent need for improved information, a core function o f the program
monitoring arm o f the nascent Economic Policy and Planning Unit (EPPU) will be to manage
poverty diagnostics at the State level. This would include making provisions for more permanent
and reliable poverty monitoring and data, including undertaking a new Household Budget Survey.
Government also plans to repeat the L S M S survey in the foreseeable future. The support o f the
International Community, including the Bank, will be essential to support EPPU capacity
building.

International Financial Corporation (IFC) in Bosnia and Herzegovina

Annex 8:

Program and Lessons Learned

As of June 30, 2004, the IFC-held portfolio for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was US$107.5
million (US$13.6 million arrears from pre-war loans). During the last three years, IFC has
committed funds to six projects for a total o f about US$60 million, supporting:

A pharmaceutical company, to rebuild i t s manufacturing plant;
A microenterprise bank to strengthen i t s position as a financial institution with broad
international support;
The Sarajevo Privatization Venture (SPV), a joint venture special-purpose vehicle, jointly
established by the Government o f BH, IFC, and an Austrian asset manager BPIC, to
facilitate privatization o f the Privredna Banka Sarajevo (PBS) group o f banks including
PBS, Central Profit Bank, and Travnik Bank;
A foreign bank, to fund housing and SME lending;
A cement factory, to support i t s post privatization rehabilitation, modernization, and
expansion; and
The Bank Austria Creditanstalt, a leading corporate and retail banking group in Austria, to
acquire Central Profit Bank from Sarajevo Privatization Venture.

In addition, Southern Europe Enterprise Development (SEED), a project development facility
managed by IFC, has been providing consulting and training to SMEs as well supporting the
development o f business development services t o SMEs. SEED operates in four areas: (i)
access to finance, (ii)
supply chain management, (iii)
business membership organizations, and
(iv) institutional support to EU S M E accession issues. In access to finance SEED i s
supporting leasing, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and factoring. ADR is aimed at
addressing the large number o f commercial cases waiting in the court system (see Box
bellow).

Box 8: BH: Alternative Dispute Resolution A Potential Contributor to BEE
The World Bank’s Business Environment Acljustment Credit (BAC) approved in June 2002 recommended the
introduction o f ADR, and, more specifically mediation, as a tool to address the problem o f inefficient and
backlogged courts. In January 2003, SEED launched its ADR program targeting four major areas for
improvement: legislative framework, capacity building, public awareness campaign, and a court supported
mediation pilot. With the full support o f the Association o f Mediators in BH, SEED and the Canadian Institute
for Conflict Resolution (CICR) have been able to establish a program which includes legislative reform, capacity
building for trainers and support to the Association. Following an extensive national awareness campaign and
advocacy effort, SEED launched a mediation pilot project in Banja Luka. Judges o f this court selected over 300
mainly commercial cases appropriate for mediation. While the pilot is s t i l l at an early stage there are strong
indications that mediation i s likely to be a major contributor to improving access to justice. To date the pick up
rate has been 60% o f cases where both parties are keen to mediate a settlement, while mediation i s also
unexpectedly proving to be a workable alternative that catalyses settlements occurring even before mediation.

61

SEED i s helping the development o f effective supply chains within the food industry and
automotive parts sector supply chain, while the medicinal and aromatic plant, construction,
furniture and I T sectors are being supported through business association development
programs. In addition to BH, the facility also operates in Albania, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia,
and SaM. BH i s the largest client o f SEED, accounting for 50% o f its workforce, and more
than 40% o f projects in each category o f services i t provides. SEED’S mandate ends in June
2005. Currently I F C i s working o n plans to secure an additional three to five year work plan
to extend its mandate to 2008.
Operational Evaluation Group (OEG) recent findings indicate that IFC’s strategy has been mostly
appropriate, especially with respect to financial markets development that have had significant
and far-reaching development impacts and satisfactory financial performance, and justify IFC’s
continued involvement in the sector. Among the lessons IFC has derived to date from i t s
investments and non-investment operations in BH are: (a) the need to take into account relevant
specific country risks when screening projects and to hold o f f disbursement if fundamental project
weaknesses are not first resolved; (b) the need to critically assess, in light o f lessons o f
experience, the ability o f state-owned enterprises to function independently in a market
environment following their split-off from a state conglomerate; and (c) the critical importance of
streamlined design and local expertise in planning non-investment operations, and o f attentive
monitoring o f such operations to be able to make timely adjustment^.^^

MIGA in Bosnia and Herzegovina

Annex 9:

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has played an active role in Bosnia
and Herzegovina (BH) since 1997, with the establishment o f the European U n i o n Investment
Guarantee Trust Fund for BH. The EU provided capital o f EURlO m i l l i o n to set up the Fund,
which MIGA administers, to issue guarantees for foreign investors in the country. T o date,
MIGA has supported eight projects in the financial, manufacturing, and health sectors. Gross
exposure as o f M a y 31, 2004 was US$208 million. MIGA’s experience in Bosnia and
Herzegovina was recently the subject o f a paper prepared by the Bank’s Conflict Prevention and
Reconstruction unit (Social Development Papers, No. 13).
MIGA’s investment marketing services: The country’s Foreign Investment Promotion Agency
(FIPA) i s one o f several applicant agencies that were successful in receiving a technical assistance
grant under MIGA’s “FDI Xchange Investment Information Development Program” (IIDP). F I P A
was awarded US$45,000 in technical assistance funding. T h e FDIX I I D P was created in MIGA
through a grant from the Japanese Government. FIPA will use the funding in FY05 for two
detailed sector profiles, and for creating an online business matchmaking tool. The first sector
profile will cover the information technologies (IT) sector; the second will cover either
agribusiness o r wood. MIGA will w o r k with F I P A for future promotion o f potential business
partnerships in BH.
MIGA’s Vienna Investor Outreach Office: During the spring o f 2004, MIGA opened the
European Investor Outreach Program (EIOP) in Vienna with funding f r o m the Austrian
government for an initial period o f two years. During FY05-07, the EIOP will cover the countries
in the Western Balkans o f Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Croatia, the FYR o f Macedonia, and
SaM. The a i m o f the EIOP i s to attract Western European companies to invest in these countries.
Subject to donor funding, which i s currently being explored, MIGA m a y establish a BH Country
Desk in the Vienna office, with a dedicated staff member who will w o r k closely with the FIPA
and other investment intermediaries in promoting foreign direct investment into priority sectors in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Finally, MIGA i s expected to continue to work with the Slovene Export Corporation (SEC)
providing reinsurance to SEC supporting Slovene investments in the country.
