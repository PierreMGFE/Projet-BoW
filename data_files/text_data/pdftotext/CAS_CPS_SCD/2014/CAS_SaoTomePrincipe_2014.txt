EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
This World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP), covering the period FY14 to
FY18, is designed to support implementation of STP’s Second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP II). It builds on the most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
which was extended into FY12 through an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) to allow the
Government to finalize the new PRSP. PRSP II is designed to reduce poverty in STP by
creating the conditions needed for growth and job creation. Growth prospects have recently
been affected by the fact that oil production is not likely to commence as expected in 2015.
ii.
With per capita Gross National Income (Atlas method, 2012) of about US$1,310,
but a small population of about 190,000, STP is one of the smallest economies in Africa.
It covers 1,000 square kilometers in the Gulf of Guinea. A lower middle- income country, it
is vulnerable to shocks due to a narrow export base, climate change, and environmental
degradation. A recent seminar in STP on lessons from other small island economies
underscored the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability, fostering
competitiveness and diversity, and the role of parliament in forming consensus on the design
and implementation of critical reform programs to facilitate private sector-led growth.
iii.
Although STP is largely peaceful and has been free of political violence since the
first multiparty elections in 1991, internal political wrangling has led to repeated
changes in government. The previous minority government was replaced by an allopposition government in late 2012 following a vote of no-confidence, and the political
situation remains fragile. National elections are not expected until August 2014.
iv.
For the past decade the country’s GDP growth has been averaging 5.7 percent.
STP maintained macroeconomic stability despite a series of shocks. Per capita income has
increased steadily, driven by rising world prices for cocoa, bonus payments for petroleum
exploration, and foreign direct investments (FDI) in tourism. Although STP has made major
advances in human development outcomes in health and education, it appears from current
trends that STP will probably not meet all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
particularly those related to gender, and sanitation. However, it has made notable progress in
improving the investment climate and the business environment.
v.
Unfortunately, robust GDP growth has not significantly reduced poverty. The
national poverty rate declined from 66.8 percent in 2000 to 61.7 percent in 2010. There are
differences by region, gender, and the educational attainments of household heads. For
instance, analysis has identified limited opportunities in urban areas and gains in agricultural
productivity as possible reasons for a relatively higher urban poverty rate and underscores the
importance of job creation, particularly for unemployed youth, and addressing skills
mismatches.
vi.
The CPS is directed to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity
by strengthening the conditions for job creation. The intent is to create an environment
that encourages increased private sector initiative and investment, including FDI, in key
sectors of tourism (already growing and with excellent potential based on STP’s biodiversity
and scenic, cultural, and historical assets); fisheries and agribusiness (especially cocoa, by

v

addressing the investment climate. credit constraints, and land policy); and potentially also
non-tourism services. 1 The strategy is to respond to STP’s current priorities through targeted
activities and policy reforms to unblock the various constraints with a view to prepare the
groundwork for increased external earnings while further improving the stability of the
macroeconomy and moving towards a more coordinated and transformational program. The
proposed WBG program is nestled within and complementary to the full matrix of donor
support. The CPS has two broad themes: (a) supporting macroeconomic stability and
national competitiveness, and (b) reducing vulnerability and strengthening human capacity.
Gender, partnership, and capacity- building are elements that cut across all the proposed
engagements. Under these themes, WBG engagement and policy dialogue will support the
Government to improve areas such as public finance and natural resource management,
private sector capacity (including tourism and SMEs), business climate and trade regulations,
jobs, primary education and skills development, and addressing climate change concerns.
WBG will partner with STP to respond to the needs of the vulnerable and poorest of its
citizens by providing temporary public works, training, and better targeted social protection.
The objective is to ensure that by the end of the CPS period STP has progressed significantly
in preparing the groundwork to increase external non-oil earnings and has built upon its
strengths and recent gains to harness opportunities for the transformation of the economy.
vii.
The expected financial envelope for the FY14–FY18 strategy period will include
an IDA16/17 allocation equivalent of about US$20 million (excluding new regional IDA
activities). 2 Given the limited size of IDA funding, selectivity and complementarity will be
required: the WBG will engage in areas where it has comparative advantage and can provide
support in coordination with other development partners (DPs). IDA resources will be
complemented by new resources from DPs, trust funds (TFs), and possible IFC investments
and MIGA guarantees. Since recent assessments have validated the effectiveness of
Development Policy Operations (DPO) at this stage of STP’s development, this CPS
continues the DPO series. Specific investments are envisaged to improve the quality of
primary education, address vulnerability to climate change, and enhance job creation by
promoting the private sector, with a focus on tourism and agribusiness. These activities will
be supported by analytical and advisory activities (AAA), technical assistance (TA), and TFs.
viii.
The CPS proposes measures to mitigate the numerous risks to the WBG
strategy. The main risks are political uncertainty, inadequate institutional and
implementation capacity, possible macroeconomic instability and external shocks, a weak
nexus between growth and poverty reduction, and issues of economic governance.

1 For instance, STP can in the long-term build the platform to exploit information and communication
technology (ICT) potential by developing appropriate skills, and addressing land and promotion policies.
2 IDA allocations for the years beyond FY14 are indicative. Actual allocations may vary depending on: (i)
total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii)
the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual
debt service foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other
IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, IDA allocations are provided in SDR
terms, while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR
(applicable for IDA16) for FY14 and US$1.50718/SDR (applicable for the remaining years). The exchange
rate for each operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval.

FY14-FY18 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Covering the period from FY14 to FY18, this World Bank Group (WBG)
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and
Príncipe (STP) is timed to support the implementation of STP’s Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II). The Cabinet approved PRSP II (2012–16) in July
2012, and the IDA-IMF Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the strategy was submitted
to the two boards on March 18, 2013. PRSP II targets priority areas to create and ensure
the conditions essential for growth and job creation—and thus poverty reduction—before
the start of oil production. Since it is now not clear when oil production will begin, PRSP
II incorporates two macroeconomic scenarios: a baseline with oil production
commencing in 2015, and an alternate where oil production does not materialize during
the period covered by PRSP II.
2.
STP is a small and fragile island state. A lower-middle-income country—an
archipelago of just over 1,000 square kilometers in the Gulf of Guinea—STP is one of the
smallest economies in Africa. It has just over 190,000 inhabitants and per capita gross
national income (GNI) of about US$1,310 (2012, Atlas method, current US$). 3 During
2000–10, STP experienced average growth of 5.7 percent. Meanwhile, however, the
absolute national poverty rate declined only from 66.8 to 61.7 percent. Limited job
opportunities and high urban unemployment, particularly among youth, are among the
root causes why poverty is stagnant. Furthermore, the economy has a narrow export base
and is highly dependent on external support. It also has a small internal market, faces
environmental degradation, and frequent turnover in government.
3.
To achieve its poverty reduction goals, STP can build on significant recent
achievements:
•

•
•

With a more stable macroeconomic framework—inflation has fallen, domestic
primary deficit targets have been met, and its international reserves are comfortable
— STP, with the support of its DPs, essentially is ready to harness its natural-resource
potential to achieve sustained, broad-based growth, and to avoid the “resource curse.”
Income distribution is equitable and the Gini coefficient is relatively low. 4
The country has significantly improved its Doing Business ranking and tops the list of
global reformers of business regulation. 5
Its human development outcomes are promising. For example, its ranking on the
UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) is higher than the sub-Saharan African
average, the literacy rate is 90 percent, and health and education indicators are good
though there are issues regarding the quality of services.

3

PPP GNI per capita in 2012 was US$1,810 (current US$); World Development Indicators (WDI) 2013.
Though still low, the Gini coefficient has increased slightly in the past 10 years.

STP has enhanced transparency in the use of public resources, with higher Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) scores, and is now a candidate for
membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

4.
Now that natural resource prospects for the near future have receded,
identifying an alternate development dynamic has become urgent. 6 STP is too small
in area and population to sustain significant internally generated growth. The issue facing
STP and its DPs now is to ensure that, without immediate oil revenues, alternative
sources of near-term external earnings for growth and poverty reduction are harnessed so
as not to squander the gains of the past few years and to move to a higher growth trendline. Fiscal consolidation will be necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability in light
of the oil revenue shortfall. Reforms to improve financial management (including reforms
to increase tax revenue and improve the targeting of public expenditures) will be critical
to create fiscal space to finance priority pro-poor spending. STP’s achievements in
improving competitiveness and the business environment to promote diversification will
need to be consolidated and continued; the agenda ahead is still sizeable. Public policies
and action to address the needs and create opportunities for the vulnerable and
disadvantaged are PRSP II priorities that will need to be moved forward. Environmental
concerns also require constant attention. These messages were also relayed during a
seminar on the experience of other successful small island economies (Box 1).
Box 1: Small Island Economies: South-South Sharing of Experiences
The leadership in STP has been seeking out lessons and good practices from other small island economies
that have successfully managed growth and economic diversification while stressing transparency and
accountability in resource management. A seminar held in STP in September 2013 on “Growth and
Economic Diversification: Comparative Experiences of Small Island States”, organized by the Government
in collaboration with the World Bank, was designed to provide the Government with examples of good
practices to foster the country’s social and economic development, particularly its efforts to promote
economic diversification, growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. Participants included STP
government officials and policy makers, the private sector, WBG and IMF officials, development partners,
and individuals representing small countries with characteristics similar as STP, such as the former PrimeMinister and Minister of Finance of Barbados, and the Seychelles Minister of Finance.
The seminar was conceived as South-South sharing of experiences related to macroeconomic resilience and
economic governance, the potential role of the tourism sector in spurring growth, the role of parliament in
setting and implementing the reform agenda, and measures to spur private sector growth and
competitiveness. Particular attention was given to the role of services, financial services, niches for
agriculture and fisheries, and economic governance of a small oil-producing country.
Among recommendations relevant for STP were an emphasis on the importance of sound macroeconomic
fundamentals to achieve sustainable growth; the critical role of structural and cross-cutting reforms to
promote private sector growth and competitiveness generally; and the large potential of the service sector,
particularly tourism, to accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth. Undertaking reforms requires,
however, a shared consensus across economic, social and political actors. For example, in Barbados and
Seychelles, consensus among the public and private sectors and the trade unions (with regular consultations
and protocols signed by each party) set the agenda for tax reforms. The role of parliament has been vital in
their economic successes. (See Annex 2 for further details.)
6

In September 2013, the French oil company Total announced it had decided to leave the first oil block of
the Joint Development Zone (JDZ), claiming that the quantity of oil is not commercially viable. Oil
production is thus not likely to start in 2015 as expected.

2

5.
A number of drivers of growth and job creation can accelerate progress
towards poverty reduction and greater shared prosperity. Regardless of the timing of
oil production, inclusive growth can be achieved by building upon present potential in
tourism and related services, and agriculture (including cocoa, fisheries, and
agribusiness) as well as hydropower. In the longer-term, STP can take advantage of the
country’s strengths (e.g., high literacy rate, improved internet and regional connectivity)
to expand in areas such as ICT and related areas. Despite their potential, these strengths
also have some limitations that need to be addressed while STP responds to the
vulnerable and poorest of its citizens by providing temporary public works, training, and
better targeted social protection.
•

Tourism is now the primary source of foreign exchange, having replaced cocoa.
It represents about 5 percent of GDP and over 40 percent of total export earnings.
The sector also has considerable potential to generate income and employment
through backward linkages to the local economy. STP has several major strengths
for tourism development (See Box 2). Given its natural and cultural assets, STP
can become a preferred tourism destination in the west and central Africa and
beyond in Europe. However, the cumbersome visa approval process needs
simplification, and an open skies policy and better airport facilities 7 would expand
STP’s currently minimal connectivity. Appropriate skills in demand are also
scarce. Given tourism’s untapped potential, a speedy adoption of the medium-term
tourism development strategy that will prioritize public and private investment and
attract FDI, will be important for STP. A sound marketing plan and work force
training are therefore needed to build up the sector.

Box 2: STP's Tourism Potential
Tourism can serve as the key engine of growth for STP. Unlike many of its neighbors, STP remains
peaceful with untapped natural resources and cultural assets. STP’s cultural heritage includes remains of
the colonial Portuguese architecture in the capital city of São Tome, the plantations – roças - on both
islands with their own rail network, and its history; while its natural endowment includes small nested
beaches and several eco-systems including rainforests that host one of the most bio diverse areas in the
world (from large sea turtles and fish, to birdlife and butterflies, as well as orchids and other endemic
flowers and plants). One can also find pristine lakes and waterfalls, various types of vegetation and
animals, making STP ideal as an adventure and trekking destination. STP can easily be branded as an
“ecotourism” destination—indeed, the limited advertising it has engaged in already uses biodiversity as its
theme. The geographic location of the island at the “center of the world” has also been used as part of the
marketing of the destination. Tourism packages that combine: sun and sea, cultural heritage and history,
biodiversity and science, and sports and adventure may be the winning formula for tourism development.

7

Frequency of weekly flights from Europe to STP is planned to increase from just once to three times
beginning in July 2014, and airport facilities are being upgraded with support from Angola. However, the
new weekly flights will last longer and will transit via Ghana. Ghana and STP however do not share a
bilateral air transit agreement. Similarly STP does not have commercial agreements with countries that
possess regional and international hubs; namely, South Africa, Kenya, and Spain.

3

•

Agriculture and fisheries can benefit from recent economic growth and reforms.
Though the primary sector has declined in importance, it still accounts for about 20
percent of GDP and a large share of household income. Cocoa’s productivity
remains low and its production fell with the collapse of the large plantations
(roças) and lack of support to smallholders, even though at the turn of the 20th
century, the majority of global cocoa production originated from STP. Cocoa and
emerging crops such as coffee and palm oil are cash crops with a ready
international market. A quick way to revive production is by supporting
cooperatives and attracting agribusiness operators and traders to stimulate
production and processing focusing on higher-end niches (e.g., high quality and
organic production). This will gradually boost employment and incomes for the
population, which would address both poverty and shared prosperity issues. But
again there is little access to credit or FDI, land rights are unclear and land plots
dispersed, marketing and branding are not coordinated, and little value is added
locally. 8 Nevertheless, the tourism-related development of roças, through their
privatization and less rigid land ownership approach, may gradually re-launch
niche agricultural production at these plantations. WBG’s proposed approach is to
start an engagement in the sector given its importance for growth, employment,
and relevance for the poorest. As an entry point, the WBG proposes to initiate
sectoral AAA to update the knowledge base. Policy aspects in agriculture may also
be explored (e.g., land) to help advance the dialogue. Progress in these initiatives
will be assessed around the CPS midpoint (CPSPR) and consideration will be
given to ramping up engagement in the sector based on the preliminary findings.

6.
The WBG strategy supports the Government’s response to these
opportunities and challenges by its alignment with PRSP II objectives and its
coordination with other DPs. The strategy will help create an environment that
encourages private sector initiative and investment, including FDI, through both targeted
activities and policy reforms. Because the IDA envelope is limited, selectivity and
complementarity are necessary. The WBG will engage in areas where it has comparative
advantage and can coordinate with other DPs. Better donor coordination, at a meaningful
level of detail and specificity to close gaps and eliminate overlaps, is paramount. The
UNDP-led exercise in preparing the donor support matrix is the focal point, and the CPS
is positioned to be an integral part of donor- coordinated support to STP. The strategy is
responsive to current priorities and the need to prepare the groundwork to generate
external earnings while building on the macro-economic and structural gains, leading
ultimately to economic transformation.
7.
The CPS proposes engagements to strengthen STP’s competitiveness and the
business environment within a stable macroeconomic framework, and to promote
its ability to deliver better services by enhancing human capacity and skills
development while reducing vulnerabilities. Thus the CPS thematic focus is to support
STP to (i) maintain macroeconomic stability and improve competitiveness, and (ii)
reduce vulnerability and build up human capacity. A program of activities supported by
8

DTIS, December 2013

4

IDA and TFs, with focused AAA to underpin the engagements proposed, will accompany
the policy dialogue. IFC and MIGA will be close partners in supporting reforms and
generating deals. Given the small size of STP, even a few of the right type of transactions
can have a transformational impact on growth, jobs creation, and regional connectivity.
II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

A. Political Context
8.
Although STP has been largely free of conflict and political violence since its first
multiparty elections in 1991, internal political wrangling has caused repeated changes in
government. Following a political confrontation in December 2012 and a no-confidence
vote, the minority government led by Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada was replaced by
an all-opposition government headed by Prime Minister Gabriel da Costa. Although this
new government holds a narrow majority with 29 of the 55 seats in Parliament, the
cohesiveness of the coalition is untested; an unsuccessful vote of no-confidence in July
2013 is testimony to this fragility. Though national legislative elections are not expected
until August 2014, 9 the political situation remains delicate. The new government’s
parliamentary backing is fragmented, leading to the possibility of an early election should
members of the current governing coalition fall out. The fragmented political scene is
likely to make policy implementation and legislative action difficult, although the policy
environment has been stable despite the many government changes in the past decade.
B. Social Context
9.
STP’s human development outcomes have significantly improved. It ranks
144th out of 186 countries in the HDI—higher than the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
average—and its indicators are improving consistently. The country continues to make
progress in expanding access to education and health services. Its health outcomes are
good: life expectancy is 66 years, and mortality and morbidity rates are far below the
SSA averages (see table 1). An increase in the proportion of births attended by skilled
birth attendants has brought about a steep decline in maternal and child mortality; the
incidence of malaria has fallen from 1,273 10 (2004) to 62 (2012) per 1,000 children under
5, and HIV/AIDS prevalence is less than 1.5 percent. STP has also made good progress in
education, especially at the primary level, and at about 89 percent literacy is high (2010).
Secondary education has not yet achieved universal coverage, however; supply is limited
to the main urban areas.
10.
STP is not likely to meet all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Progress has been made in some of the key human development indicators (e.g., primary
education, albeit with quality issues; maternal and child mortality rates; halting the spread
of HIV/AIDS; access to safe water). However, significant strides are still necessary in the
areas of gender, partnering for development (see Annex A2), and sanitation. Appropriate

A figure above 1,000 signifies more than one episode of malaria per child per year.

5

sanitation facilities are lacking in STP for large parts of the communities in rural and suburban areas 11.
11.
The STP constitution and subsequent laws emphasize gender equality. The
2004 Country Gender Assessment noted a dichotomy between official gender equality
laws and policies and actual gender-associated socioeconomic status. Although women
are well-represented at the highest political level, at lower levels their influence on
political decision-making is limited. Women’s labor force participation is also lower than
that of men and their unemployment rate higher (see Annex 3: Poverty Profile, which has
gender-specific data on most indicators). In 2010, of all those older than 15, 84.7 percent
of women were literate compared to 93.9 percent of men; yet for those aged 15–24, the
95.9 percent literacy rate of women overtook that of men (94.7 percent)(WDI).

Recent Economic Developments

Growth rates for STP have been high in recent years. In the past decade real
GDP growth averaged 5.7 percent, compared to just 1.4 percent for the 1990s. Propelled
by rising world cocoa prices, bonus payments for petroleum exploration, and FDI in
tourism, 12 growth led to a sustained increase in per capita income for the first time since
independence.
13.
When in the first nine years of this century fiscal expansion led to doubledigit inflation and a steep depreciation of the dobra, 13 in 2010 the Authorities

pegged the exchange rate to the euro. Together with falling food and fuel prices the peg
brought inflation down dramatically, from 32 percent in 2008 to 10.6 percent in 2012.
International reserves, estimated at US$53.4 million in 2013, represent more than 4.5
months of non-factor imports, well above the IMF program floor of 3 months. 14
14.
STP is on a fiscal consolidation path. As a result of the exchange rate peg, fiscal
policy has been the main tool for maintaining macroeconomic stability. The country has
reduced nonessential current expenditures, contained the nominal growth of the wage
bill, and reduced arrears between the Treasury and parastatals.
15.
STP is continuously improving the transparency of its management of public
resources. In the 2012 Open Budget Index, the STP rank jumped from 94th (the bottom
position) to 62nd, and it was recognized as one of the top reformers in the world in budget
transparency. Also, in 2013 STP for the first time prepared a Citizens’ Budget for
transparent public discussion of the allocation of resources. Although STP still gives
minimal information to the public in its budget documents, continued reforms are
expected to further improve the transparency of and accountability for public resources.
16.
These efforts have helped STP to maintain macroeconomic stability despite a
series of shocks. STP’s growth in 2013 is estimated around 4 percent amid the persistent
economic slowdown among key European partners. Beginning in 2012, STP has been
experiencing a deceleration of growth, down from 4.9 percent in 2011, because of lowerthan-expected official transfers financing capital expenditures and FDI. Nevertheless,
fiscal consolidation efforts helped STP to maintain a domestic primary deficit of 3.1
percent in 2013, in line with the IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) target. (Table 2)
17.
Yet STP is still highly vulnerable because of its narrow export base. The
current account deficit excluding official transfers is projected at 34.1 percent of GDP in
2013. Current account deficits have been covered by private capital inflows and donor
support. Official net overseas remittances have increased, but still only account for 3
percent of GDP. After reaching 25 percent of GDP in 2010, FDI has continuously
declined reaching 8.4 percent of GDP in 2012.
18.
Behind-the-border barriers have limited STP’s trade competitiveness. Given
the fixed exchange rate, the inflation differential with the euro zone resulted in a real
exchange rate appreciation that negatively affected exports. However, constraints on
competitiveness are mainly rooted in microeconomic issues. The Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS) Update, while hailing the government efforts in setting up a
single window for foreign trade transactions, streamlining bureaucracy and creating a
single point of contact for the entrepreneurs, suggests strengthening transparency and
reducing costs, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, improving the technical skills of the
labor force, and strengthening regional integration.

19.
STP relies heavily on external donor assistance for both recurrent and
capital expenditures (Table 2). More than 90 percent of the public investment program
is supported by donors and most pro-poor recurrent expenditures are financed by Official
Development Assistance (ODA). Sector-wide approaches and direct budget support are
seldom used, and donor-financed projects often bypass government institutions entirely.
This undermines fiscal sustainability as recurrent expenditures on donor projects are not
adequately accounted in budget documents. 15
20.
Despite positive results from the Government’s fiscal consolidation reforms
and recent progress in reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the SOEs are still
characterized by poor service and weak financial performance. Their shaky financial
position, particularly that of the national electricity and water utility (EMAE), has
generated contingent liabilities and necessitated transfers from the Government that
undermine its own fiscal position. Arrears between EMAE and the now partially
privatized national oil importer, ENCO, have not yet been settled. In addition to these
arrears, ENCO is claiming additional payments from the Government to cover losses
arising from government restrictions on the prices ENCO is allowed to charge. 16
Economic Prospects
21.
Though near-term STP’s economic outlook is clouded, the longer-term
outlook is positive. In 2014 growth is expected to accelerate, mainly driven by
investments in construction to support tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. Large private
investments include requalification of the airport in Príncipe and oil palm projects.
Donors will continue to finance most public capital spending.
22.
Growth prospects have been undermined by the fact that oil production is no
longer expected to start in 2015. GDP growth had been expected to jump to about 38
percent in 2015, but in September 2013, Total, the French oil company, announced its
decision to leave the first oil block of the Joint Development Zone (JDZ), 17 citing
findings that exploration based on the given oil quantity is not commercially viable. In its
first public response, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy declared that enough oil is
available and that medium-size enterprises are currently evaluating the possibility of
replacing Total. The shortfall in expected government revenue will necessitate fiscal
adjustments to control debt and will likely affect foreign investment, which had been
based on expectations for the development of the oil sector.

15

In July 2013, the Government held a second donor meeting and presented the draft Priority Action Plan
(PAP) to support the policy areas identified in the PRSP II and the related PAP. Donor meetings are now
held on a quarterly basis to exchange information about ongoing and planned projects.
16
ENCO is not allowed to sell petroleum products at “real” prices, since their retail prices, which are set by
the Government, do not include import costs, taxes, and distribution margins. The Government sets ad hoc
official retail prices for petroleum products, and there is no system to automatically adjust them to
international prices. Hence, retail prices are often below the real prices.
17
In 2001, STP and Nigeria signed the Joint Petroleum Exploration Treaty to manage the joint exploration
of potential oil resources in the JDZ.

9

23.
Reserves are expected to be sufficient to keep the peg credible and keep
inflation on a downward path. International reserves are projected to remain well above
the standard metric of three months of imports during 2014. The credibility of the peg has
been enhanced by a €25 million credit line from Portugal 18 and access to the US$9.9
million deposit to the National Oil Account (NOA). Inflation is estimated to have been
8.2 percent in 2013 and projected to fall to about 7 percent in 2014 due to an increase in
agricultural production and stable international food prices.
24.
The Government is committed to accelerate fiscal consolidation in order to
maintain macroeconomic stability. In recent years STP was able to finance sizable
domestic primary fiscal deficits from oil-signature bonuses and privatization receipts.
However, with the privatization account depleted, the Government is likely to have few
options for domestic financing in 2014–15. The Authorities will concentrate on the fiscal
adjustment agenda, with continued efforts to raise domestic revenues. They plan to
broaden the tax base (adding an estimated 3,000 taxpayers by year-end 2014) and better
manage tax collections (using the ASYCUDA World system to make customs collection
more efficient). The Authorities, as part of the IMF ECF program, plan to strengthen tax
administration and with support of the AfDB to set in place a strategy to optimize tax
revenues. The Government plans to achieve a domestic primary fiscal deficit of 3 percent
of GDP by 2014 and then gradually reduce it to 2 percent by 2017.
25.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA 2013) notes that STP is at high risk of
debt distress over the medium term, and debt sustainability will require fiscal
adjustment and borrowing on highly concessional terms. Reaching a debt profile that
is consistent with manageable (though high-risk) debt dynamics would require the
additional fiscal adjustment of 1 percent of GDP over 2015–17 as projected; continued
heavy reliance on grants and highly concessional lending; and intensified efforts over the
medium term to diversify the economy and expand the export base. The DSA also
recommended fiscal prudence, particularly in the run-up to the 2014 elections. Debt
service indicators are particularly sensitive to changes in the terms of public borrowing,
suggesting that STP is highly exposed to changes in loan concessionality, and needs to
seek out only highly concessional financing. STP is subject to IDA’s non-concessional
borrowing policy (NCBP) which requires that the country adopts a prudent external
borrowing policy reliant on grants and highly concessional loans. STP’s medium- and
long-term public and publicly guaranteed external debt was estimated at US$221.6
million (84 percent of GDP) as of December 2012. The debt burden increased from
US$200.1 million at end-2011 (due to disbursements from Portugal and Nigeria) yet
remains significantly below the pre-debt relief high of US$359.5 million at end-2006.
The share of multilateral debt declined from nearly 60 percent before the HIPC
completion point to 20 percent. Portugal is now the country’s main bilateral creditor, and
IDA is its main multilateral creditor, although since FY2008, STP’s IDA financing has
been provided on 100% grant terms in response to STP’s high risk of debt distress. In
March 2014, however, the authorities signed an agreement with Angola for a loan

amounting to US$40 million to be spent during 2014-2015, which does not meet the
minimum concessionality element of 50 percent agreed upon under the IMF program and
required by the NCBP. A new joint WB-IMF DSA is under preparation and is expected
to be completed by the end of May 2014. The DSA will analyze the impact of this loan
on debt sustainability indicators. In the meantime, the Bank is deepening its policy
dialogue with the authorities on this issue, and will assess the borrowing in the context of
the NCBP.
Poverty Profile 19
26.
STP’s robust GDP growth in recent years has not translated into high level
of poverty reduction. Indeed, between 2001 and 2010, the growth elasticity of poverty
(with respect to growth in per capita income) was about 0.5, meaning that for each 1
percent increase in per capita income, poverty decreased only by 0.5 percent. 20
27.
There are also disparities in poverty between regions. The Center region,
which is predominantly rural, has the lowest poverty rate (57.3 percent), though even
there rates 21 in urban areas are higher (Figures 1 and 2), with the capital, Água Grande, at
62 percent. In the poorest southern regions, where many coastal fishing villages are
located, 74 percent of the population is poor. Finally, the poverty rate on the island of
Príncipe, very isolated as well as mostly rural, is a high 69 percent. The Center region
experienced a major fall in poverty (about 7 percentage points) between 2000 and 2010.
Poverty rates in southern STP are almost invariant.
28.
Though still relatively low, STP’s income inequality has increased between
2000 and 2010, particularly in urban areas. This partly explains the small gains in
poverty reduction despite an increase in GDP per capita. Despite this increase, STP
remains among the countries with the most equal income distribution in SSA. The Gini
index in 2010 was 33.6, well below the median Gini index for SSA (42.7) 22, with urban
areas recording a Gini index of 34.3 compared to 32.7 in rural areas, and with a faster
increase in urban areas.
29.
Poverty reduction has been larger for households whose head is more
educated. In 2010, the poverty rate was 73.8 percent when the head of household had no
formal education, 66 percent when the head had some primary education, 55.1 when the
head had finished secondary school, and 31.9 percent when the head had tertiary
education. The poverty rate did not change between 2000 and 2010 when the head of the
household had no education, but rates went down 9.1 percent for households whose heads
had primary education and 10.1 percent for those whose heads had tertiary education.
19

This section draws on the forthcoming World Bank São Tomé and Príncipe Poverty Assessment.
Data for GDP per capita start in 2001 (WDI database). Poverty rates are based on the STP 2000 and 2010
Household Surveys. To ensure consistency, the change in poverty rate between 2001 and 2010 is
constructed using a linear interpolation.
21 Unless otherwise stated, poverty rates refer to absolute poverty.

30.
Female-headed households are poorer, and their poverty rate was reduced less
than for male-headed households. This probably relates to differences in education: 67
percent of female heads of household have no formal education versus 33 percent for
male heads. The poverty rate for female-headed households fell from 71.4 percent in
2000 to 67 percent in 2010, compared to a drop from 64.7 percent to 58.6 percent for
male-headed households.
31.
Few job opportunities may explain why the poverty rate has stagnated in
urban areas. Urban poverty rates are mainly driven by the labor market of the capital,
Água Grande, which accounts for 72.4 percent (2010) of the total urban population.
According to preliminary census findings, the population of Água Grande increased by
41 percent between 2001 and 2012. Concurrently there were increases in labor market
participation (the inactive rate went down 15 percent) and in the unemployment rate (by 7
percentage points). One reason for the increase in active workers is the emergence of a
tertiary sector, with hotels, banks, and supermarkets. This has generated new economic
interactions but is unable to integrate all new workers entering the labor market due to
problems of both supply (skills mismatch, given a low-skilled labor force) and demand
(small and weak firms) issues.
32.
Productivity gains in agriculture might explain the lower poverty rate in the
center of the country. The center has benefitted from DP programs to support creation
of cocoa farmers’ and fishermen’s cooperatives, which have pushed up agricultural
productivity. These programs began in the mid-1990s with PNAPAF (the National
Support to Smallholders Program) and continued with PAPAFPA (the Participatory
Smallholder Agriculture and Artisanal Fisheries Development Project). They offer advice
on microcredit, extension services, and diversification, and build rural infrastructure. In
the south-west, by contrast, the agriculture sector, though crucial, is poorly developed and
infrastructure is lacking, which makes the region highly vulnerable to price variations and
a deeply inadequate basic food supply.
12

D. Development Challenges and Opportunities
33.
As noted, STP has considerable opportunities to reduce poverty and foster
shared growth, especially through tourism, niche agriculture, and fisheries. There is also
hydropower potential and new oil production potential (although viability is not certain).
•

Despite frequent changes in government, STP has been relatively peaceful. This
bodes well for accelerating poverty reduction and shared growth, since conflict
retards development. 23
Access to education and health services has greatly improved. The 2011 CEM
indicates that education was a major driver of economic growth in STP. Thus,
productive sectors can draw more easily on well-developed human resources.
The country has impressively improved its business climate. It was acknowledged
as one of the 10 top reformers in the 2012 Doing Business Report (it shot up in
ranking from 180 out of 183 countries to 160 out of 185 countries), 24 and that
same year the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom named it the
top global reformer of business regulations (for instance, in 2011 STP increased
registered businesses by about 35 percent.) 25 IFC and the Bank have supported an
initiative to simplify customs clearance procedures. 26 STP has also advanced
licensing reforms (also with support from IFC and the Bank) and instituted an evisa system to encourage tourism. Since the country became a member of the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in December 2012, potential
investors can now tap opportunities to insure against political risk. It is expected
that MIGA will seek out opportunities to work with the WBG team. 27
Governance and transparency in the management of public resources are
continuously improving. STP is currently ranked 72nd out of 176 countries on the
Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, up from 111th in 2009.28
There has been an increased public participation in the budget process and in the
transparency and comprehensiveness of the budget documents. Public financial
management (PFM) is more professional and recent laws will make it more
effective. STP has adopted an oil revenue management law (ORML) to establish
the basis for good management of oil-related institutions and has become a
candidate for EITI membership. But, as noted below, challenges remain.
STP is more active in regional cooperation initiatives, as is critical given its
limited economies of scale and its insularity. It is a member of the Economic
Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Community of

The nexus between development and conflict is discussed in the World Development Report, 2011.
Doing Business rankings for 2014 have declined by a few notches to 169 out of 189; the “dealing with
construction permits” measure regressed the most, by 10 places.
25 However, the EIU Country Report indicates a slowdown in the momentum for reforms after initial
enthusiasm, reflecting perhaps government complacency or a lack of support to implement policy reforms;
STP’s drop by three places in the 2013 Doing Business Index illustrates this loss of momentum. (EIU
Country Report, 2nd Quarter 2013, p.17).

Portuguese Speaking Countries. Angola has extended STP a line of credit and the
two countries have signed a partnership agreement to improve port and airport
infrastructure. Brazil is cooperating with STP on a technical training center, and
STP has a fisheries agreement with the European Union (EU). All these activities
should help STP to integrate more closely with neighboring countries for trade
and other forms of economic cooperation.

Yet if it is to significantly reduce poverty, the country needs to tackle major
challenges. Since its recent robust GDP growth has not had much impact on poverty,
STP needs to put into action a game-changing strategy to meet the ambitious PRSP II
goal of reducing poverty by another 10 percent by 2016.

Unemployment and skills development: The unemployment rate grew from 12 to 14
percent between 2000 and 2010, and even more in urban areas. Of the working age
population, 58.3 percent are employed, 19 percent unemployed, and 22.7 percent
inactive. 29 Though the employment rate for men is 90 percent, for women it is 81.3
percent. Unemployment is also high among youth: about 23 percent of those aged
15–24 are unemployed and another 29 percent are inactive. About 25 percent of the
poor are unemployed, and another 35 percent are inactive. According to the 2011
CEM, STP needs to create 31,000 new jobs within 10 years—a 70 percent increase
from the current level. Skills mismatch also contributes to unemployment.
Macroeconomic stability: Because a stable macro-economy is a precondition for
growth, STP needs to commit to tight fiscal discipline. Fiscal consolidation efforts
will be crucial to provide the space needed to finance vital, especially pro-poor,
expenditures. They include reforms to step up tax collection, revise the fuel pricing
mechanism, clear the arrears between EMAE and ENCO, and make public spending
more efficient—for instance, electricity subsidies are not well targeted 30
Governance and institutional capacity: Despite significant progress, debt
management and other PFM reforms are still at an early stage. The credibility of
budget execution is minimal. Auditing and procurement processes need to be
tightened. Regulations still need to be drafted to fully operationalize the debt law.
Private sector development, competitiveness, and investment flow: Property rights,
particularly for land, need to be clarified; small and dispersed land plots raise the
cost of agriculture; and red tape abounds. Limited access to credit is a major
problem and the majority of the population, especially the poor and those in
agricultural cooperatives, lack access to financial resources; unclear property rights
make use of collateral difficult. There is thus an urgent need to couple regulatory
and macro reforms with catalytic interventions to build capacity, improve the
competitiveness of the private sector, and promote access to finance in order to take
advantage of new niche opportunities.
Diversification and trade integration: STP’s product concentration is very high
even when controlling for the size of the domestic market. Tourism has replaced
cocoa as the primary source of foreign exchange. The CEM recommends a focus on

growing sectors that have the most export potential, such as tourism and related
services. The Bank’s DTIS Update provides recommendations on high-priority
areas identified based on STP’s main trade challenges.
Infrastructure deficits: STP suffers from a shortage of electrification (60 percent)
and its high cost; frequent blackouts represent economic losses of about 4 percent of
GDP a year. PRSP-II emphasizes the need to expand the capacity of EMAE, partly
by exploring options for alternative power generation. Also, the lack of access to
low-cost, high-quality telecommunications services limits the potential for growth,
although the new submarine cable, put in place with Bank support 31 and operational
since early 2013, is expected to ease communication shortcomings and lead to
possible growth in ICT-based services in the longer term. Finally, there is a need to
explore sustainable development of ports in STP.
Service delivery and quality of human capital: Large numbers of the poor find it
difficult to access basic services like secondary education, health care, and nutrition
because of barriers related to both supply (lack of services) and demand (lack of
household income) constraints. Quality of education is a major concern. Teachers
are not well-qualified and learning time is limited by a multiple shift regime.32
Quality indicators based on standardized tests are absent. Repetition rates at all
levels, though they have been brought down substantially, are still high. Health
sector issues include limited and imbalanced distribution of qualified human
resources, a weak health information system, and low-quality local services. STP
has a high number of fatalities associated with road traffic injuries, and the
incidence of non-communicable diseases is increasing.
Social protection: The population is highly vulnerable to unpredictable shocks, such
as food shortages and climate change. STP has some social protection programs,
mostly in social assistance, but their coverage and effectiveness are low. Social
insurance involves several contributory programs, including elderly pensions,
disability, medical, and maternity and other subsidies. There is an array of small
and underfunded social assistance interventions implemented by several agencies as
well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and DPs.
Environmental protection: STP is naturally prone to flooding and coastal erosion.
High rates of erosion, caused both by removal of sand for construction and by storm
surges, threaten coastal residents, who are among the poorest communities in STP,
the poor having traditionally settled in marginal lowland areas left vacant by old
plantations. The vulnerability of coastal settlements is therefore increasing rapidly,
particularly as floods and sea storms intensify and property loss worsens. High rates
of youth unemployment have also increased pressures on natural resources,
particularly fishing and forestry. STP’s vulnerability to climate change can only
increase: the forecast is for temperatures to climb by an average of 2°C as

31

The World Bank’s Regional Central African Backbone Project supported financing of the cable.
Almost one-third of the primary schools (grades 1– 4) used to work on a triple-shift system, with average
class-time of only two or three hours daily. Attrition was also high; only 47 percent of STP children reach
6th grade. By eliminating triple shifts and constructing new classrooms, teaching time now averages 3.5
hours per day, and survival rate from grades 1 to 6 has increased (ICR Social Support Project, Report No.
ICR00002683).

precipitation drops by about 15 percent; that means longer dry seasons and more
flooding and fogs, which have contributed to an STP fishermen mortality rate that is
triple the world average.
Statistical information: STP’s statistics still need further improvement (see Annex
4). A household survey was conducted in 2010, and the Bank is supporting
government preparation of a poverty assessment. The dearth of demographic data
and the lack of targeted surveys, such as enterprise and labor market surveys, make
it harder to analyze aspects of the economy and estimate the true scale of poverty.
Better data are also needed to evaluate critical sectors, such as an agricultural
census that will be crucial for designing policy that promotes agricultural
investment (DTIS Update).

WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

A. Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy
35.
PRSP II identifies priority areas of intervention for 2012–16. Its goals are to
create and ensure maintenance of conditions essential for growth and job creation, and
thus poverty reduction. PRSP II has four pillars: (i) promoting good governance and
public-sector reform; (ii) supporting sustainable and inclusive economic growth; (iii)
enhancing human capital and extending basic social services; and (iv) reinforcing social
cohesion and social protection, particularly for vulnerable groups. 33 PRSP-II prioritizes
good governance, competitiveness and diversification, and natural resource management,
especially transparency in the use of oil revenues and capacity in the oil sector. The
Bank-IMF JSAN observed that the PRSP II presents a coherent analysis and offers
appropriate policies for long-term poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth. It
also noted that the primary poverty reduction objective – a 10 percent decrease in the
poverty rate over the next four years–is ambitious.
B. Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy
Lessons from the CAS Completion Report
36.
The CAS Completion Report (CASCR, Annex 5) discusses major lessons
learned from WBG engagement during the last CAS and ISN period. In preparing
the current CPS, these lessons were taken into account:
•

Broad-based macroeconomic support is key to ensuring successful
implementation of a CPS. Bank support anchored on policy instruments and
macroeconomic performance, such as DPOs, provided structure and mitigated
political instability and frequent changes in government priorities. The reforms
supported by the WBG including the ongoing DPO series are in line with PRSP-II,
which was developed through an extensive consultative process, including

representatives of the Government, its cooperating partners, STP’s major political
parties, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders throughout the country.
Close coordination between the Bank and the IFC has helped STP to make
significant progress in making the business environment more attractive. To
consolidate these gains, that coordination should continue. Now that STP has also
joined MIGA, this CPS is based on a WBG program that benefits from close
collaboration among IFC, MIGA, and IDA.
STP might now be served better by shorter, timely, and more focused policy
notes in critical areas, since major analytical pieces such as the CEM, Poverty
Assessment, and DTIS Update, have already been produced.
Support to the petroleum sector through the EITI should continue. This would
help to ensure that efforts to build capacity are pursued and that reforms are put in
place to allow solicitation of new contracts to explore the Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ). The WBG should also support the Government to continue to build on recent
gains in transparency and accountability in the general public sector as well as the
petroleum sector.
To consolidate recent gains, the CPS should continue its engagements in the
social sectors. The Social Sector Service Project (SSSP, US$8.6 million) has had
encouraging results in both health and education, and further support is expected
through the Global Partnership for Education (GPE).
Poor donor coordination has led to ineffective use of funds and other
inefficiencies. After sporadic inefficient donor coordination efforts, the Government,
with support from the UNDP, convened donors’ meetings in December 2011 and
December 2012, and in July 2013 it presented a draft Priority Action Plan (PAP) to
support the policy areas identified in the PRSP II. Quarterly donor meetings to
exchange information are now planned. Since the country is highly dependent on
donor support, the WBG should take on a greater coordinating role in its areas of
expertise. The capacity of the Authorities to coordinate and integrate donor programs
should be built up.
In this spirit, the Bank should continue to promote a multi-stakeholder
approach to harness the unique contribution of DPs to provide an interconnected
program of knowledge, projects, and technical assistance (TA).
Dedicated staff in STP can move the program forward faster. Given the limited
program and resource envelope, it is recommended that fiduciary staff representing
financial management, procurement, and accounting within the Ministry of Planning
serve as a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), with dedicated project staff added as
needed, rather than separate PIU for each project.

Lessons from the Client Survey
37.
The CPS also draws on the findings of a June 2012 client survey in which
about 200 stakeholders were invited to give their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to
STP. Of these, 40 percent were from ministries and implementation agencies. Among
lessons from the survey applied in preparing this CPS were that:

17

•

•
•

Those within government could become more familiar with the WBG.
Knowledge of the WBG was extremely low—not surprisingly, since there is no
WBG office in STP and the portfolio is focused on a few sectors. A question
would be how to strengthen key relationships with government officials.
Energy, agricultural development, and foreign direct investment are seen as
crucial if poverty is to be reduced effectively.
Other issues identified as important in the survey were whether the Bank
supports programs that are realistic for STP; the effectiveness of Bank support;
and concerns about Bank flexibility and timeliness. Asked what factor is most
responsible for slowing reforms, a third of the respondents cited inadequate
citizen participation.

Lessons from Stakeholder Consultations
38.
In preparing the CPS, the WBG team met with a wide range of stakeholders,
including civil society organizations (CSOs), the media, business associations, NGOs,
and members of Parliament. Some CSOs, such as FoNG (an NGO umbrella group),
provide services while others are professional associations with limited scope of action.
Some enthusiastic youth groups could benefit from training in leadership and demandside governance to better impress their footprint on society, and many indicated that
unemployment and lack of access to finance to start businesses are major problems.
Members of Parliament consulted explicitly asked for support to set up specialized
commissions to deal with development challenges related to, e.g., PFM, climate change,
extractive industries, and fragility. The Bank is identifying programs that could respond
to that request.
Overview of the WBG Partnership Strategy
39.
The proposed CPS is aligned with the development vision of the Government
as outlined in PRSP II and the twin WBG goals of poverty reduction and shared
prosperity. The strategy proposes to partner with the Government to respond to STP’s
current priorities through targeted activities and policy reforms to unblock the various
constraints that hinder private sector initiatives and investment flows. This will help
generate increased external earnings by further improving the stability of the
macroeconomic framework; enhancing skills and reducing vulnerabilities; and moving
towards a more coordinated and transformational program. It focuses on two broad
themes—(i) supporting macroeconomic stability and national competitiveness; and (ii)
reducing vulnerability and strengthening human capacity. Gender, partnership, and
capacity building are elements cross-cutting all CPS activities. To support these themes,
WBG engagements during the CPS period will be directed to reinforcing PFM;
unblocking major policy constraints to investment flow; developing the right skills mix;
brokering transactions to bring in investments and expertise; and addressing
vulnerabilities while filling in critical knowledge gaps. The first theme recognizes the
importance for STP of ensuring macroeconomic stability, making management of public
and natural resources more transparent, and building up the private sector and trade
integration. The second theme is directed to more effective social protection, delivering
18

better-quality services, and supporting skills development. The associated Results
Framework identifies outcomes linked to both current and proposed WBG activities
(Annex 1).
40.
The CPS is particularly attentive to both the WBG agenda on jobs (WDR
2013) and the Africa Region’s continuing work on youth employment. These have
helped focus the CPS on such interventions as enhancing the business environment (e.g.,
access to finance and infrastructure, increased electrification, and ICT), human capital
(quality of education and skills development), youth employment, diversification, and as
common for small island nations, connectivity to the global market.
Engagement Areas and Objectives
41.
Given limited WBG resources, selectivity is crucial. The CPS proposes limited
engagements that respond to client demands and will contribute most effectively to
poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Expected outcomes from the proposed activities
(as outlined in Box 3) will be achieved by leveraging Trust-Funds and partnerships, and
by undertaking key analytics to complement the limited IDA envelop. Criteria for
program selection are:
•

•

•

•

Knowledge as the foundation: The WBG will leverage the AAAs already available
(e.g., PER, CEM, DTIS Update, Poverty Assessment with analysis of genderdisaggregated data) to prioritize proposed interventions. Certain areas of knowledge
work are identified, such as the tourism strategy, skills, and social protection, as
building blocks for future interventions. The CPS proposes to undertake demanddriven and flexible just-in-time policy advice in areas critically linked to WBG
activities (e.g., DPO series). AAA can also serve to build knowledge in new areas
where the WBG would like to be engaged, for instance, agriculture where AAA
would provide the platform to advance policy issues such as land reforms.
Comparative advantage and readiness: Proposed interventions will be assessed
based on WBG comparative advantage in the area, availability of WBG staff with
relevant expertise, implementation capacity, realistic assessment of risks, and
flexibility given capacity constraints. Since STP needs are high, staff will also call
on trust fund (TF) and other resources to support priority activities.
Closer coordination and harmonization with DPs in priority areas will be vital to
access additional resources and enhance their effectiveness. For example, while
water and sanitation needs are significant, this CPS does not propose WBG
engagement given the substantial engagement of the EU, Brazil, and the UN, among
other DPs. Similarly, the health sector receives considerable support from other
donors. In recent years, IFAD and the UN have been lead agencies in the agricultural
sector; the WBG hopes to complement their efforts by focusing on policies and
institutions (e.g., land policy, agribusiness support, and access to credit), and perhaps
through IFC transactions.
Any proposed activity will leverage all the institutions in the WBG. For instance:
 IFC will continue to support competitiveness/investment climate-related reforms
in collaboration with the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management
19

(PREM) and the Financial and Private Sector Development (FPD) units. It may
also seek to operate in transactions that facilitate development of the targeted
tourism, and agriculture/ agribusiness sectors.
 MIGA will explore offering political risk insurance (PRI) guarantees across a
range of products to encourage investment, especially in tourism and possibly
natural resources. As an IDA country, STP is a strategic priority for MIGA.
42.
The CPS will continue the DPO series. Currently, the WBG is the only donor
providing budget support, and the CASCR confirmed the effectiveness of the DPOs (with
a focus on governance and competitiveness), which have produced desirable policy
outcomes. Continuation of the DPO series, informed by related analytical work and
complementing a TA on improving the business climate, will be used to consolidate these
outcomes, supplemented by specific instruments to address vulnerability, skills
development, and private sector development (PSD)/job creation objectives. Within the
DPO series, the possibility of engaging in the agriculture sector, for example, by looking
at policies related to land reforms, will be explored provided there is consensus and
ownership.
43.
There are significant synergies among the proposed CPS activities. For
instance, the DPO-supported policy and institutional reforms will be complemented by
the private sector operation, TA, AAA, and IFC/MIGA activities in order to ensure that
the reforms undertaken have the desired impact on private sector led growth. Skills
development is incorporated into components within the private sector support, social
protection, and ongoing teacher training projects, along with analytical work on skills
strategy. Finally, employment generation is enhanced through the private sector
initiatives, and specific (though small-scale) employment activities are included in the
private sector, social protection, and adaptation to climate change operations.
44.
These proposed activities have particular focus on the identified engines of
growth. While proposed activities to support the tourism sector are explicit, the WBG
proposes to undertake an agriculture sector AAA (including assessing the export potential
of niche products to the region), and to increase the sector’s linkages with the tourism
sector. For instance, the business plan competition of the proposed PSD project will
support SMEs/farmers interested in increasing the linkages between the agricultural and
tourism sectors (e.g., by providing fruits and vegetable to hotels), thus sharing the
prosperity from the envisioned tourism growth. In addition, although coffee and cocoa
are covered by donor programs (such as a PAPAFPA) and by the exporters already
operating in the country, given the climatic conditions of STP, there is potential to export
other niche products such as tropical flowers and fruits, especially to neighboring
countries. The envisioned agriculture AAA will assess the regional export markets for
niche products to neighboring countries like Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, and
will also propose agricultural policy issues that can be addressed as part of the DPO
series.

45.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability is fundamental for robust economic
growth, diversification, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity. The importance of
prudent macroeconomic management was underscored at the seminar on small island
economies (Box 1 and Annex 2). To this end, collecting more tax revenue and using
public resources more efficiently will be crucial, as will more effective delivery of
essential public goods and services on which the poor rely most heavily. WBG support
will again buttress government efforts to move forward with critical reforms in these
areas. Diversifying STP’s small economy, harnessing PSD-led growth, and enhancing
trade integration are critical if poverty reduction is to accelerate. The drivers of growth
such as tourism and agribusiness, have not yet fully benefited from reforms to date due to
constraints in capacity and access to finance, as well as complex business procedures.
Attracting more FDI, as well as greater regional integration, could be furthered by using
TF and other resources while leveraging the DPO series, the PSD project, and possible
IFC initiatives. Cross-sector interventions range from investing in sea and air transit and
rural infrastructure to reduce trade costs and improving labor force vocational and
technical skills to sector-specific and trade-related policy reforms.

21

46.
Outcome 1: Strengthened public financial and natural resource
management: Consolidating macroeconomic gains and dismantling critical barriers to
harnessing drivers of growth are major objectives (e.g., a more viable energy sector, more
efficient public spending, and more transparency in petroleum and fisheries operations).
Proposed AAA on agriculture should also begin to highlight possible areas for policy
dialogue and future reforms (e.g., land). The new DPO series will support selected policy
areas working in close coordination with the IMF and other DPs.
•

•

•

•

Increasing tax collections and the efficiency of public spending. Enhancing tax
revenue collection, and reducing cross-arrears between Treasury, EMAE, and
ENCO, will be vital to create fiscal space and reduce the dependence of the
budget on external resources. The Authorities, as part of the IMF ECF program,
are planning to introduce measures to strengthen tax administration and, with the
support of the AfDB, identifying a plan to optimize tax revenues. Supported by
DPO2, the Government has committed budget resources to pay utility bills of
public sector bodies to EMAE. 34 The Authorities, as part of the ECF program, are
further elaborating a plan to improve the financial sustainability of EMAE and in
turn, to clear arrears from EMAE to ENCO. The WBG, in close collaboration
with the IMF and AfDB, will support the government efforts to implement these
plans and to identify a strategy to revise the fuel price mechanism. These efforts
will be informed by the forthcoming Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA)
on electricity subsidies and a proposed policy note on public spending.
Improving PFM transparency and accountability. The WBG program will help
STP to build up financial statement preparation, auditing and public procurement
systems. This relatively young PFM system faces quantitative as well as
qualitative capacity constraints. STP has gone through the first steps of legislative
and institutional public procurement reform, but poor capacity constraints at
central level institutions as well as in the Procurement Management Units at
sector level hamper good public procurement system performance. Apart from
current and planned DPO actions, AAA is proposed to analyze the procurement
system performance with special attention to quantitative and qualitative capacity
constraints aimed at increased performance of a small island procurement system
and Value for Money (VfM) for beneficiaries (see Annex 6).
Public debt management. Although with support from the DPO series the
Government has begun to manage debt better, the pace of reform has been slow.
The WBG, working with the IMF and other DPs, will support the Government to
update the 2011 reform plan and elaborate a medium-term debt strategy and
related legislation.
Parliamentary oversight. Parliamentary debate on public policy and oversight by
specialized committees are inadequate. The critical role of Parliament in
formulating and overseeing reforms was emphasized in the Seminar on Small
Island Economies. Based on a specific request from Parliament for help in
becoming more efficient, the Bank has outlined such possible areas of

34 This follows the recommendations of the Energy Sector Action Plan prepared by the Bank and IFC, with
support from an Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) TA grant.

22

•

•

collaboration as South-South knowledge exchanges; formal training and capacity
building; and the possibility for STP legislators to take part in WBG-sponsored
parliamentarian network gatherings.
Fisheries management. Fisheries have significant potential to generate public
revenues but need to be transparently managed, with tighter monitoring of fishing
agreements and licenses. The DPO series is helping to firm up the laws related to
disclosure of fishing agreements and licenses information. The Bank has
emphasized the need for further reforms to enhance public revenue collection,
deter corruption, and curb illegal fishing. Data to monitor fishing activities is
essential to achieve these goals. Improving safety for small-scale fishermen is
being addressed by Adaptation to Climate Change project financed by the Global
Environment Facility (GEF).
Oil sector governance. Since STP is now an EITI candidate, building the capacity
of the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) is a PRSP II objective. The WBG will
continue to provide TA on implementing EITI principles through an EITI MultiDonor Trust Fund (MDTF) to ensure that STP is in compliance by October 2015.
The WBG will also offer support for building the capacity of ANP staff and help
the Government to review the laws governing the oil industry with a view to
making it more competitive and attractive to investors.

47.
Outcome 2: Enhanced statistical system. As part of the DPO series, the WBG
proposes to help the Government to build up its national statistical system, working in
close collaboration with bilateral donors providing assistance dedicated to data collection.
There are also a number of areas (e.g., land, fisheries, and enterprise surveys) where
improved data will be needed to inform the policy discussions and options.
48.
Outcome 3: Improved private sector capacity with a focus on the tourism
sector and SMEs. Lack of access to financing and high interest rates, 35 together with
lack of management capacity and ill-targeted marketing strategies, have depressed private
sector development and diversification, narrowing the sector’s employment potential.
Legal and institutional reforms in agriculture and land will also need to be addressed to
spur agribusiness investment, land productivity, and use of collateral to access financing.
The support envisaged will build upon IFC TA and DPO reforms.
•

Tourism: The WBG, including IFC and possibly MIGA, will support tourism by
continued support to simplify regulation and visa processes, and by enhancing
STP capacity to implement a tourism strategy. TA on management will be
provided to the Directorate of Tourism. The sector may also be supported by TFs,
such as the CIIP linked to the Private Sector Development Project. The proposed
agricultural sector AAA would also explore the linkages and supply chains for the
tourism sector. IFC will work with the Bank to define conditions for increased
private investment in the STP tourism and hospitality industry through a
feasibility and market assessment study, and will actively explore new markets

35

In STP interest rates are high—31 percent on short-term bank loans, compared to 18 percent in Gabon
and 10.5 percent in Burkina Faso.

23

•

and partnerships, e.g., with Brazil. MIGA can support this effort by offering
political risk guarantees, for example, to ensure land concessions for tourism
development against the risks of breach of contract and expropriation, thus
eliminating a potential obstacle to FDI. Moreover, MIGA analysis of potential
engagements may help to identify other obstacles to foreign investment and hence
feed into WBG private sector development work. Backward linkages with the
local economy may also be evaluated, which may lead to jobs being created in
manufacturing, services, and agriculture and also help improve infrastructure.
These linkages can be supported through the proposed BPC Project, which would
unfold a continuum of support for promising entrepreneurs with the assistance of
local partners. All this should lead to more job opportunities and greater
entrepreneurial skills for young people.
Support to SMEs: The package of support to SMEs, focusing on tourism as the
key growth service sector, and niche agribusiness (including cooperatives), will
center around two pillars: promoting access to finance and building SME
capacity. The agenda for promoting financial inclusion is broad and covers areas
of legal framework and collateral registry system; capacity building;
implementation of a leasing program under IFC’s Africa Leasing Facility to
enable acquisition of productive assets by local SMEs; promotion of financial
literacy; and entrepreneurship and SME skills development through a business
plan competition (BPC) 36. An early intervention would support the Authorities to
develop a financial sector development strategy that would define, prioritize, and
cost key measures for promoting financial inclusion and ensure financial sector
stability. Specific training to SMEs may also be provided by IFC’s Sustainable
Business Advisory Services through the “Business Edge” product program. The
proposed IDA Private Sector Development Project will provide direct capacity
building support to entrepreneurs and employees for SMEs in the priority sectors
of tourism and related services as well as agribusinesses. Existing Bank and IFC
TFs will seek to be utilized to advance the microfinance agenda. 37. IFC also plans
to launch SME toolkit activities with the private sector. This initiative would be
complemented through parallel financing by TFs such as the Competitive
Industries and Innovation Program (CIIP) focusing on sectors such as tourism, the
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative advancing financial
inclusion, and other donor initiatives that aim to promote private sector
development. To foster small enterprise access to commercial loans, IFC will aim
to enter into a Risk-Sharing Facility with one of STP’s leading commercial banks
(IDA MSME Risk Sharing Facility).

49.
Outcome 4: Improved business environment and trade regulations. The STP
Government has adopted a plan to reform the investment climate and has already moved
forcefully, with IFC TA. The Authorities now plan to establish an electronic Business
Registry System, online incorporation and other public services, draft a new Construction
36

This initiative will link with the Outcome on skills development strategy.
IFC research on feasibility of microfinancing in STP found that there appears to be no current initiatives,
or appropriate institutional and legal frameworks.
37

24

Act, introduce insolvency legislation, streamline municipal licensing of microbusinesses,
and build up commercial courts. The Bank’s support to create an alternative dispute
mechanism that may be endorsed by IFC may result in an arbitration tribunal being set
up, which would bypass the current lack of judicial capacities. These efforts would be
supported by TA from the IFC Investment Climate Reform Program, complemented by
TFs such as CIIP, with policy reforms supported by the new DPO series. These reforms
will help existing enterprises to grow, help businesses to move beyond the informal
sector, and increase their likelihood to access business development services and finance.
To improve energy supply, the WBG will continue its support to the sector and also draw
on the findings of on-going analytical work on power sector efficiency improvement; the
goal is to identify key interventions to reduce electrical losses and to make one of STP’s
hydropower plants more efficient. The CPS also proposes to support STP’s efforts to
reduce costs of trading. IFC and the Bank together will support the Government in
defining a roadmap for sustainable port development on STP islands, taking into account
competing regional port infrastructure. The WBG may also help the Government identify
a strategy on regional integration opportunities and reforms to reduce the costs, time, and
paperwork required to import and export, and establish a single electronic trade window.
50.
Outcome 5: Better targeting of energy subsidies. The energy sector faces many
challenges, including inability to carry out adequate power utility management. The
WBG will continue its support to the energy sector and also draw on the findings of the
ongoing AAA on Power Sector Efficiency Improvement. It will focus on identifying the
key interventions to reduce electrical losses (technical and commercial). The WBG, in
close collaboration with the IMF and AfdB, will support the Government to implement
these plans and to identify a strategy to revise the fuel price mechanism. These efforts
will be informed by the forthcoming Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) on
electricity subsidies and a planned policy note on public spending. The WBG proposes to
provide capacity building to improve energy utility management, including a gap analysis
of the current situation, and developing a methodology to calculate technical losses. It
will also support the training of local workforce in the application of the methodology.
Other agencies are currently working in the sector: UNDP is preparing a GEF project to
promote environmentally sustainable and climate resilient grid-based hydroelectric
electricity through an integrated approach, to promote investments in renewable energy
and reduction of pressure on natural resources from competing land uses.
51.
Outcome 6: Improved regional broadband connectivity. While it was
dependent on satellite communications, STP was ill-placed to compete in the global
economy, given that countries connected to submarine cables access international
capacity at a fraction of the cost. 38 This limited its potential to create jobs, expand
production of goods and services, and trade competitively with the rest of the world.

38

In East Africa in particular, where three submarine cables arrived in the last three years, the volume of
traffic has increased almost 20-fold, and prices have dropped by a factor of almost 10—from
US$3,750/Mbps/month before cables arrived in 2007 to US$400/Mbps/month today. Prices are down to
US$100 in Morocco and Australia, and as low as US$10 in Europe.

25

However, a submarine cable (supported by the Bank 39) has been operational since early
2013 and has eased STP’s communication problems (Annex 5, CASCR). A second
telecommunication operator has now been selected, which should lead to even more
affordable communication services and harness the potential of ICT to create jobs and
opportunities. STP may also request and benefit from follow-up projects, such as the
Central African Backbone (CAB6) regional program. The Government has expressed its
wish to connect Princípe Island to the backbone, which may be possible through planned
projects between Equatorial Guinea and Príncipe, but is not yet confirmed.
Theme 2: Reducing Vulnerability and Strengthening Human Capacity
52.
The poor are highly vulnerable to shocks, both economic and climate-related,
that affect household income and consumption. Thus, there is a need for a social
protection strategy to help the extremely poor to better manage risks and cope with
shocks, while promoting investment in child development by improving access to social
services and participation in income-generating activities. The Government has made
modest progress, with support from DPs, in drafting a social protection strategy and
making a safety net system operational. In 2011, with the support of UNICEF and ILO,
the Government analyzed the social protection system and is currently drawing up a
social protection strategy focused on noncontributory interventions.
53.
Delivering quality social services and providing an appropriately skilled
labor force has been a challenge for STP. The quality of education is low: there is no
learning assessment system, 60 percent of teachers are unqualified, and education
management is poor. STP, with support from the WBG, has increased access to primary
education, but even with high youth literacy, there is a large gap in skills development
since the secondary completion rate is less than 60 percent and achievement in vocational
and technical education beyond that is even lower. As a result youth unemployment is
twice the national level and the inactivity period after graduation is very long. 40
54.
Outcome 7: Improved poverty targeting. The Social Protection Policy and
Strategy being discussed recognizes the need to better target safety net interventions if
extreme poverty is to be eliminated by 2023; other social indicators also need significant
improvement. Given how little it has been reduced in the past 10 years, it is necessary to
understand the dynamics of poverty to identify optimal poverty reduction and shared
prosperity measures. The WBG is working with the Government on a thorough
assessment of poverty dynamics so that targeting and policy formulation can be
improved. The current PSIA on energy will also inform policy makers on how to better
target the poor. The WBG will provide TA to the Government, in collaboration with
other DPs (particularly UNICEF), to support design and realization of the social
protection policy and strategy. Bank support would include the analysis of options to
minimize targeting errors including geographical identification of areas, community

55.
A key element of the social protection strategy under discussion would be a
labor-intensive public works program, complemented by a revamped conditional
cash transfer mechanism (Programa de Apoio as Familias em Extrema Pobreza).
Based on the outcomes of TA, the WBG would consider supporting the Government in
the design and launch of a public works “plus” program targeting poor unemployed
youths with training and TA to enhance their skills and employability. The program,
which would aim for at least 35 percent women participants, would complement the skills
development work proposed for Outcome 6. It would also seek to scale up the good
experiences already tested in community-based road maintenance groups (Grupo de
Manutenção de Estradas), which consist mainly of women. The program would select
beneficiaries using the targeting process as described above and in addition to possible
community participation through the system to select beneficiaries, would also include a
set of social accountability mechanisms to ensure quality of works and beneficiary
participation, as well as grievance and redress tools. The WBG has secured funds for TA
from the Rapid Social Response Multi Donor Trust Fund.
56.
Outcome 8: Increased adaptive capacity of coastal communities and reduced
potential loss of assets and lives. STP’s high vulnerability to climate change in the form
of coastal erosion and floods has a direct impact on its coastal and fishing communities,
among the poorest in STP. The WBG will continue to help STP to reduce this
vulnerability through the Adaptation to Climate Change Project by helping draft climateresilient plans for vulnerable settlements, putting in place adaptation and protection
measures, and strengthening early warning and safety at sea systems for vulnerable
fishermen. It will also scale up the pilot labor-intensive community-based adaptation
activities in the climate change project, and seek to involve women. The Project includes
community monitoring, which includes monitoring the number of days of flooding per
season, and will soon expand to a pilot community based early warning systems.

27

57.
Outcome 9: Improved training of teachers in primary education. The WBG
has been actively supporting STP to deliver better deliver education and health services;
it also provided technical support to prepare the education Country Status Report 2012,
and the Education Sector Plan 2011–13. The assistance has helped to build capacity to
deliver health and education services. The on-going Quality Education for All Project
(FY14), funded by IDA and a GPE grant, aims to improve in-service teacher training.
Partnership is being sought with Portugal, which is quite active in the sector.
58.
Outcome 10: Increased access to skills development. Given both high youth
unemployment and skills mismatches, the CPS proposes to support enhancements of
technical and vocational training by preparing a comprehensive strategy that outlines
vision, objectives, and expected medium- and long-term outcomes for the sector. The
strategy will provide a coherent umbrella policy covering all the currently sparse and
segmented vocational training interventions offering by various DPs. The WBG will
work on the strategy with the Government, the private sector, and Brazil, Portugal, and
the AfDB, among other partners. Design of any engagement will also draw upon the
Africa Region Flagship Report on Skills Development, and to the extent possible also
link to the private sector and social protection initiatives that include skills training to
SMEs and those participating in labor-intensive employment .
Box 3: Addressing Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
The proposed WBG activities will be designed to address the twin WBG goals through clear linkages:
• The DPO series will help maintain macroeconomic stability and trade related reforms that are essential for
growth. Transparency-related reforms will help enhance value-for-money in public spending. Reforms to
increase revenue collection, reduce arrears, and improve efficiency and use of public resources will create fiscal
space to support priority spending and enhance the delivery of essential public goods and services on which the
poor rely most heavily. Reforms to simplify business and trade procedures and spur tourism will help to foster
private sector and employment and attract new investments, extending growth benefits to wider population
• Social sector protection and vulnerability reduction interventions will (i) help to identify social safety net
programs and targeting mechanisms that will best support the poorest 40 percent, helping to reduce extreme
poverty and improve the lives of the lowest two economic quintiles; and (ii) partner with the Government to
design and pilot a labor-intensive public works program to support the poorest, smooth consumption, and
provide skills training to directly address one of the main reasons that keep certain groups below the poverty
line. These activities are intended to support backward linkages, supply chains, and skills development. The
Adaptation to Climate Change Project is already reducing the vulnerability of very poor coastal communities by
increasing their capacity to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change.
• The PSD-related initiatives include a project that will directly support capacity building for SME entrepreneurs
and employees to foster investment and employment creation, so that these entrepreneurs will be in a much
better position to access credit and other financial services. It is expected that a growing number of SMEs will
cater to agriculture, tourism, and services (e.g., ICT, finance and leasing, vocational training, agribusiness, and
agriculture value chains). IFC advisory service, AAA, and TFs will complement private initiatives. The cable
regional broad band network project is helping to enhance PSD capacity and connectivity.
• The education and skills activities include a project to improve the quality of primary education and support the
transition of better-qualified students to higher education to address the skills shortage and mismatch issues and
contribute to greater youth employment in growing sectors. A skills strategy will inform the initiatives in social
protection and the private sector.

28

Implementing the FY14–FY18 Country Partnership Strategy
Financial Envelope
59.
The expected financial envelope for FY14–FY18 will include an IDA
allocation (IDA16/17) equivalent to about US$20 million, 41 excluding possible new
regional IDA activities. IDA allocations for the years beyond FY14 are indicative. Actual
allocations may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s
performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance
(grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual debt service
foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for
other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, IDA
allocations are provided in SDR terms, while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided
at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR (applicable for IDA16) for FY14 and
US$1.50718/SDR (applicable for the remaining years). The exchange rate for each
operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval. .New
resources will also be leveraged from other DPs, TFs, possible IFC investments, and
possible MIGA guarantees.
Managing the Program
60.
The performance of the portfolio has been largely satisfactory (see Table B2).
In its current configuration, the portfolio contains one IDA/GPE Quality Education for all
Project which was approved in December 2013; one Regional Central African Backbone
APL2 Project (P117652) for US$14.9 million, which has US$1 million left to disburse; a
GEF Adaptation to Climate Change Project (P111669) for US$4.37 million, of which 30
percent is disbursed); and TFs (including GEF) totaling US$68.4 million, of which
US$64.8 million is disbursed (see Annex 7). 42 Efficient PIUs with stable and seasoned
staff and experience in managing Bank-financed projects has contributed to the
satisfactory performance—there are no problem projects.
61.
Management of the program is envisaged to be as follows: Two PIUs are
currently managing Bank programs and an EITI Secretariat will be established with
MDTF resources. DPOs are handled by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. The CPS
proposes a liaison officer to facilitate communication with the Authorities and PIUs,
renting space in the UN offices to smooth communication. The CPS also proposes an
enhanced PIU within the Ministry of Planning and Finance with fiduciary staff for
financial management, procurement, and accounting to support Bank-financed projects,
with staff dedicated to particular projects working with the PIU as needed. Although
PFM has improved, more needs to be done (see Outcome 1 and Annex 6).

41

This assumes the same IDA17 envelope. IDA 16 envelope for STP was SDR8.5 million (about US$12.8
million—US$4.3 million a year).
42
This amount consists primarily of HIPC Trust Funds.

29

Partnerships and Donor Coordination
62.
The WBG works closely with partners in STP to ensure harmonization and
better leverage resources. Active multilateral partners in STP include the AfDB, the
EU, United Nations agencies (UNDP, UNEP, UNICEF, UNFPA, WFP, WHO, IFAD,
FAO), the IMF, and the Global Fund (see Annex 8 for areas of development assistance).
Active bilateral partners are Portuguese Cooperation, Brazil, Spain, the French Agency
for Development (AFD), the USA, and other countries in the region. In particular:


The AfDB is implementing its Results-based Country Strategy Paper (2012–16) to
improve economic and financial governance and strategic planning and
programming, and to create a more conducive environment for the private sector.
Approved in July 2012, the strategy focuses on a single pillar, “capacity building
and institutional strengthening,” to prepare STP for oil production by
strengthening key public institutions.
The EU Tenth European Development Fund (2008–13) has projects in transport,
trade, public finance, and support to economic reform.
The IMF approved a new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program in July 2012.
This is the third IMF program since 2009. The first review for this new ECF
arrangement took place in March 2013. The second review and the Article IV
consultation were concluded on December 16 and 19, 2013, respectively.
UNDP, Portuguese Cooperation, and Brazil provide TA for, among other areas,
budgetary management. UNDP is also helping STP attain the MDGs and
strengthen governance and environmental management, and supports the energy
sector. UNDP is the lead agency on donor coordination.
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has supported STP as it works to
improve both revenue collection and the business environment.

63.
In spite of recent progress, there is scope to improve donor coordination. The
Authorities met with donors in July 2013 to seek support for the Government’s Priority
Action Plan and to discuss donor coordination. Participants noted that the Aid
Coordination Unit within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is inadequate, and most DPs do
not have resident representatives. Proposed were quarterly informal coordination
meetings and setting up a transparent information system on donor support. The
possibility of a multidonor fund to support priority development areas was suggested to
reduce transaction costs and improve coordination and management of assistance. At the
September 2013 meeting, UNDP presented a consolidated matrix (a first cut) of donorsupported projects. Although the matrix is not yet complete, this represents an important
step toward donor coordination. The Government presented a plan for establishing a
more effective Aid Coordination Unit, with assistance from UNDP.
64.
Moving forward, The World Bank Group will play a larger role in donor
coordination. STP is now being overseen by the Gabon Country Office, whose
proximity and ease of travel will bode well for enhanced participation in donor
coordination.

30

Monitoring and Evaluation
65.
Progress on the CPS will be mainly monitored using the Results Matrix (see
Annex 1). The results framework links WBG activities to select STP objectives (as
articulated in the PRSP II) through chains that clearly identify inputs, outcomes (to be
monitored against baseline and target indicators and with gender-disaggregated data
where possible) and intermediate milestones. These linkages offer lines of sight to clarify
how WBG-supported engagements and partnerships can help STP move toward its
objectives of poverty reduction and shared prosperity in STP. A CPS Progress Report at
midpoint will offer an opportunity both to assess progress and to make any necessary
course corrections. Of particular importance will be what happens in the oil sector.
Regular consultations will be undertaken with the client, DPs, and other stakeholders to
receive feedback and assess progress. The experience with the community and local
feedback mechanisms in the Adaptation to Climate Change Project could be replicated in
other WBG engagements, in particular, the Social Protection and Vulnerability Pilot. It is
expected that M&E and data-gathering systems already in place or part of other projects
in STP will elicit data for measuring results.
IV.

MANAGING RISKS

66.
The main risk to realization of the CPS emanates from political uncertainty
that could slow reform. The current political scene is, as noted, fragmented and fragile;
disruptions caused by a sudden change of government could delay or encumber policy
reforms, though the major political parties are committed to structural reform. This risk is
moderate and is already partially mitigated given that the PRSP-II, which outlines the
priorities and policy directions for STP, and with which the proposed CPS program
(including the ongoing DPO series) is aligned, was developed through an extensive
consultative process and buy-in from wide range of stakeholders including all major
political parties. This risk can be further mitigated by a carefully timed sequence of DPOs
to advance reforms even with changes in government, complemented by targeted
constituency outreach, public information campaigns, stakeholder engagement, and
capacity building. Other risks and proposed mitigating measures include:
•

•

Inadequate institutional capacity needs to be resolved. To that end, the WBG
has capacity building as a cross-cutting theme in such areas of intervention as
economic management, EITI, human development, energy and the business
environment.
Risks to macroeconomic stability are high, also as a result of the high debt
level and narrow export base, impacting the DPOs. A new joint WB-IMF DSA
is under preparation and is expected to shed more light on the impact of the
overall debt on the macro stability. On the Bank’s side, this risk will be mitigated
through continuing dialogue with the authorities on this issue. If there is
significant deterioration in macroeconomic stability, the Bank will continue
providing policy advice but may opt to suspend its DPO program and divert the
IDA funds to other programs.

31

•

•

•
•

•

Any global economic slowdown will pose significant risks given STP’s
dependence on a narrow export base and limited sources of external earnings.
Though the previous global recession did not impact STP strongly, maintaining
the focus on prudent macroeconomic management will be key.
The fiduciary risk related to use of public funds may prove challenging. This
risk could be mitigated by tighter internal controls and by the internal and external
audits embedded in WBG programs. It would also be helpful to improve fiduciary
capacity by strengthening internal controls, improving the quality of accounting
records, and producing State financial statements—all of which the CPS proposes.
Governance may deteriorate. The WBG will continuously monitor aspects of
the country situation that might directly affect its programs. The interventions
proposed have been carefully selected to ensure appropriate governance.
Due to compounding risks and challenges all results may not be achieved
during the CPS period. Given the small IDA envelope and scale of
engagements, a limited administrative budget, constrained staff resources,
inadequate STP implementation capacity, and lack of reliable statistical and M&E
information, there is a significant risk that all CPS results may not be obtained as
scheduled. However, there is demand for WBG resources and advice, and
progress achieved in some key areas would substantially unlock the potential for
poverty-reducing growth and equitable prosperity.
The tenuous growth-poverty nexus may continue to be a challenge. Recent
economic growth has not translated into commensurate or expected reductions in
poverty. The quality of economic growth matters; recent and continuing AAA
(CEM, DTIS Update, and Poverty Assessment) will continue to provide the
analytical underpinnings of strategies for poverty reduction and their realization.
Given the Government’s concerns in this area, WBG has proposed to support a
variety of initiatives for poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

Annex 2: São Tomé and Príncipe: Seminar on Small Island Economies
1.
During September 10-12, 2013 a high level seminar was held in São Tome and
Príncipe (STP) to discuss the “Growth and Economic Diversification: Small States’
Comparative Experiences,” in particular, small island economies. The seminar was
organized by the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tome and Principe and
the World Bank. The main objectives of the seminar were to: (i) assist the Government of
STP with inputs, ideas, and good practices to foster the country’s social and economic
development and, particularly, efforts for economic diversification, promotion of growth
and creation of jobs, and poverty reduction; and (ii) strengthen the WBG’s consultative
process to gather inputs for the preparation of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
The seminar also aimed to support STP’s preparation for the third International
Conference of Small Insular States which will take place in 2014.
2.
Contributors to the deliberations included high-level policymakers, STP
government officials and stakeholders, and a number of different entities and individuals
representing national and multinational institutions and small countries with similar
characteristics as STP. Among key participants were: Mr. Alcino de Barros Pinto
(Speaker of the National Assembly of STP); Mr. Gabriel Arcanjo da Costa (Prime
Minister and Head of Government of STP); Mr Jose Cassandra (President of the Regional
Government of STP); Mr. Owen Arthur (former Prime-Minister and Minister of Finance
of Barbados); Mr. Pierre Laporte (Minister of Finance of Seychelles); Mr. Agapito
Mendes Dias (Executive Director of the World Bank); Mr. Jean-Philippe Prosper (Vice
President, IFC); Mr. Julio Revila (acting Country Director of the World Bank for STP),
and Mr. Ricardo Veloso (head of IMF mission to STP).
3.
The seminar was conceived as South-South sharing of experiences, focusing on
(i) macroeconomic resilience and economic governance, (ii) the potential role of the
tourism sector to spur growth, (iii) the role of parliament in the reform agenda, and (iv)
measures to spur private sector growth and competitiveness. Consultations took place
with members of parliament, central government officials, the regional government of
Principe, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector. The objective
was to foster a dialogue and reflections among the main stakeholders. Seminar sessions
included:
•
•
•
•

Strengthening of the tourism sector in Principe Island
Building resilience and improved economic governance in small states
The role of the parliament in transforming a small economy
Fostering private sector growth and competitiveness

The main conclusion and recommendations that emerged from the seminar were:
4.
Sound macroeconomic fundamentals are essential to achieve sustainable
growth. This has been the basis of the success of both Barbados and Seychelles in
achieving higher levels of development. STP has undertaken several steps to accelerate
fiscal consolidation in order to maintain macroeconomic stability and support strong and
consistent growth: Significant results have been already achieved, including a primary
38

domestic deficit in line with concessional lending policy and a substantial reduction of
inflation. The Government of STP should continue with its efforts on strengthening the
macroeconomic fundamentals with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, the AfDB,
and other development partners.
5.
Structural and cross-cutting reforms are the key to promote private sector
growth and overall competitiveness. The experiences of successful small island states
show that, in addition to macroeconomic fundamentals, it is very important to develop a
clear path of structural reforms aimed at fostering private sector growth. Two
comprehensive issues are overall improvement in competitiveness and reduce
vulnerabilities. The reform program should be guided by a lucid development strategy
with clearly measurable targets, and should be based on the following principles:
strengthening of economic governance, human resource development, a comprehensive
tax reform that enables and does not hider private sector growth, leadership initiatives for
regional integration, institutional reforms, and good governance. STP has undertaken
steps to improve the investment climate (for example, the Government’s ongoing
Licensing Reform Program is simplifying business registration). But a more ambitious
program of reforms needs to be designed and implemented. The development of key
infrastructure, such as power and ports, need to be led by a clear commitment to develop
financially sustainable provision of services. Further efforts should be made in creating
an adequate regulatory, financial and tax framework, beyond only trying to finance these
projects. The Government also needs to tackle key reforms in the energy sector, such as
improving the financial position and service delivery of the electricity company (EMAE).
EMAE has weak finances and provides irregular, low-quality service. Low levels of
electrification, with frequent blackouts, represent significant economic losses.
6.
The service sector, particularly tourism, has a large potential to accelerate
sustainable and inclusive growth. The cases of Barbados and Seychelles offer good
guidance on focusing on the service sector, and especially tourism, as a way of fostering
broad-based growth with significant generation of employment. A set of principles has
been followed in these countries: avoid monopoly, but guarantee property rights;
emphasize the niche character of tourism development in the islands combining it with
the historical heritage; develop appropriate tourism strategies; let the industry lead and
prosper and do not penalize it with taxes and fees; diversify the markets to reduce
vulnerability; invest in the maintenance of infrastructure; and balance investments so as
not to degrade the environment. STP needs to position itself in the appropriate segment of
the service-related value chain for investments. For example, tourism should be focused
on high quality and not based on mass tourism. In Príncipe, some of these developments
are taking place, but the overall STP tourism strategy needs to be revitalized.
7.
Undertaking reforms requires, however, a shared consensus across economic,
social and political actors. The experience of Barbados shows that a tripartite consensus
- among the public and the private sectors and the trade unions - is key for moving
forward the reform agenda. Annual consultations were held and protocols signed by the
representatives of each party setting the reform agenda in key areas, such as on the
reform of the tax system. The role of parliament has been key in the success of Barbados
39

and Seychelles. Development occurs more easily when there is an environment of
transparency and accountability. Parliament should play a bigger role as the guardian of
fiscal stability as well as the main actor in dealing with structural reforms. The critical
roles include creating consensus, managing sectoral transformations, strengthening the
rule of law, and fostering institutional reforms. Training and strengthening capacity in
parliament is a constant process (“Parliament is not only a place to talk, but a place to
think.”).

Annex 3: São Tomé and Príncipe - Poverty Profile 43
1.
Almost two-thirds of the population is poor in STP. The incidence, intensity,
and severity of poverty are slightly higher in urban areas. In 2010, about 61.7 percent of
the population consumed less than a basic basket of goods. A slightly larger share of the
total and poor population lives in urban areas. In urban areas, the poverty headcount
index was 63.8 percent while in rural areas it was 59.4 percent. The poverty gap, which
measures the distance of the poor to the poverty line as a percentage of the latter, is 24.7
percent in urban areas and 21.3 percent in rural areas (Table 1).

2.
There are also wide disparities across regions in terms of poverty. The lowest
poverty rate is observed in the Center Region, which is predominantly rural. The poverty
rate 44 in the (urban) capital, Água Grande, is 62 percent. In the poorest southern regions
(Caue and Lemba), poverty concerns 74 percent of the population, and urban and rural
areas display similar poverty levels. The Center (Me-Zochi, Cantagalo and Lobata),
which is predominantly rural, has the lowest poverty rate (57.3 percent). Finally, the
poverty rate in the island of Príncipe, which is also mostly rural, is a high 69 percent.
3.
More than half of the population has two or fewer meals a day. Although
poverty is higher in urban areas, city dwellers suffer less risk of food insecurity. In 2010,
only 44.1 percent of non-poor households and 30.1 percent of poor households had three
meals a day. The proportion of households having three or more meals a day is
considerably larger in urban areas (41.2 percent) than in rural areas (32.6 percent).

43
44

This section draws heavily on the ongoing World Bank, Sao Tome and Principe Poverty Assessment.
Unless otherwise stated, poverty rates refer to absolute poverty.

41

Similarly, 11 percent of urban households reported having only one meal compared to
14.5 percent of rural households.
4.
Electricity covers less than 50 percent of poor households. There are major
differences in the use of energy sources between urban and rural areas. Electricity is more
widespread among non-poor families (58.3 percent) compared to poorer families (47.5
percent). Lighting is instead powered by oil to a larger extent in poor households (42.1
percent) than in non-poor households (31.8 percent). The use of energy sources varies
widely, with 73.9 percent of households in rural areas using wood for cooking compared
to 34.6 percent in urban areas.
5.
In the last 10 years, access to water has improved in rural areas helping to
close the urban-rural gap, while access to sanitation facilities improved at a slow
pace. According to the World Development Indicators, 89 percent of the population
living in urban areas, and 88 percent in rural areas, had access to water (2008). These
figures represent an improvement compared to the beginning of the decade, when only 70
percent of rural population had access to water. In 2000, only 27 percent of the urban
population had access to sanitation facilities; in 2010, the figure had improved marginally
to 30 percent. A similar trend is observed in rural areas where there was a very marginal
increase (about 4 percent) in the share of the population with access to sanitation facilities
between 2000 and 2010.
6.
Inequality is low compared to other Sub-Saharan countries and slightly
higher in urban areas. STP is among the countries with the most equal income
distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Gini index for STP in 2010 was 33.6, well below
42.7, which is the median Gini index for Sub-Saharan Africa 45. The Gini index in urban
areas is 34.3 compared to 32.7 in rural areas. STP has become slightly more unequal,
especially in urban areas. However, the absolute magnitude of these changes is contained:
the Gini index rose from 31.8 to 33.
7.
Between 2000 and 2010, the poverty rate at the national level declined by 5.1
percentage points from 66.8 to 61.7 percent 46. The decline was larger in rural areas
compared to urban areas. In urban areas, the poverty rate declined by 4 percentage points
from 67.8 to 63.8 percent. In rural areas, the poverty rate decreased by 6.2 percentage
points from 65.6 to 59.4 percent. Over time, the center of the country, experienced a
major fall in poverty rates (about 7 percentage points) between 2000 and 2010, followed
by the capital. Poverty rates in southern STP and in Príncipe remained almost invariant
(Figure 2).

45

Calculation based on the latest available data in Povcalnet.
Absolute poverty rates for 2000 were calculated by the World Bank team following the imputation
methodology proposed by Christiaensen, Luc, Peter Lanjouw, Jill Luoto, and David Stifel (2012), "Small
area estimation-based prediction methods to track poverty: validation and applications," Journal of
Economic Inequality, 10, issue 2, pp.267-297. This has allowed a comparison of absolute poverty rates
between the two years for the first time (see São Tomé and Príncipe Poverty Assessment, forthcoming).
46

42

8.
Differences in agriculture productivity might explain the observed variations
in poverty rates across regional rural areas. Agriculture productivity in the Center is
higher than the rest of the economy, allowing a higher proportion of its population to
move above the poverty line or very close to it. The Center has benefitted from programs
that have been supporting the creation of cocoa farmers’ and fishermen’s cooperatives,
increasing agriculture productivity. These programs began in the mid-1990s with
PNAPAF (National Support to Smallholders Program) and later with PAPAFPA
(Participatory Smallholder Agriculture and Artisanal Fisheries Development Project).
These programs include advice on microcredit, extension services, diversification, and
rural infrastructure. In contrast, the South West is highly dependent on a poorly
developed agriculture sector and weaker infrastructure which make the population in the
region highly vulnerable to price variations and very poor basic food supply.

urban and rural areas, 2000 and 2010

regions, 2000 and 2010

and 2010.

9.
The level and trend of the national urban poverty rates are driven by the
labor market developments of the capital. Água Grande accounts for 72.4 percent (in
2010) of the total urban population. According to census data, the population of Água
Grande increased by 41 percent between 2001 and 2012, and rose from 51,886 to 73,091.
Labor market indicators show that Água Grande has experienced a significant decrease
(15 percentage points) in the inactive rate, and an increase (8.6 percentage points) in the
rate of employment and unemployment (7 percentage points). Reasons that can explain
the observed change in the proportion of inactive workers is the emergence of a tertiary
sector (that includes hotel, banks, and supermarkets) that generates new economic
interactions but is unable to incorporate all new workers entering into the labor market,
either for demand problems (small and weak firms) or supply constraints (skill
mismatches given a low-skilled labor force).
10.
Poverty reduction is higher for households with more educated heads. In
2010, the poverty rate for heads-of-household with no formal education was 73.8 percent,
66 percent for heads of household who have finished some primary education, and
declines for those who have finished some lower and higher secondary, or tertiary
43

education (55.1 and 31.9 percent, respectively). Comparing 2000 and 2010 data, the
poverty rate did not change for households whose heads have no education. By contrast,
the poverty rates for households whose heads have higher education have decreased
considerably by 9.1 percent, 1 percent, and 10.1 percent for those households whose
heads have some primary, some lower secondary, and some higher secondary or tertiary
education, respectively.
11.
School enrollments at all levels of education have improved and STP has
almost reached universal basic education coverage. According to official figures, the
enrollment rate for each level of education has increased since 2006. In 2011, the
enrollment rate in basic education was 94.9 percent. Quality indicators based on
standardized tests, such as the PISA, are absent.
12.
Poverty rates among female-headed households are higher. The rate of
poverty reduction for female-headed households is smaller than that for male-headed
households due to differences in education levels. The poverty rate for female-headed
households declined from 71.4 percent in 2000 to 67 percent in 2010, while it went down
from 64.7 percent to 58.6 percent for male-headed households. One possible explanation
is that the education level for female-headed households is lower than male-headed
households (67 percent of female-headed households have no formal education versus 33
percent of male-headed households).
13.
There is a gender gap in literacy rates although it has been closed for young
people. According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), 89 percent of adults
could read and write a short, simple statement in their everyday life in 2010. This figure
is not as compelling when broken down by gender. Only 84.7 percent of women older
than 14 years are literate compared to 93.9 percent of men according to the WDI
definition. Yet in 2010, the literacy rate of young women overcame the literacy rates of
young men.

44

Annex 4: São Tomé and Príncipe - Statistical Issues
1.
The latest household survey was completed in 2010. Nevertheless, the scarcity of reliable
socioeconomic statistics and weak statistical capacity constrain the design and implementation of
public policies.
2.
Statistics of National Accounts are at an early stage of development and estimates of
GDP by sector composition are weak.
3.
Economic policies are often based on administrative sector information which makes it
difficult to set priorities and measure progress toward achieving the MDGs or monitor PRSP
implementation.
4.
The ongoing DPO series supports efforts to strengthen statistical capacity, including the
recently completed census of the population and STP membership to AFRISTAT. The Poverty
Assessment being analyzed and finalized would also provide related statistics, including gender
dimensions. In 2014, the Authorities further aim to submit to the National Assembly, for the first
time, an evaluation report of STP’s system of national statistics to raise awareness and improve
the management and reporting of statistics.

Annex 5: São Tomé and Príncipe - CAS Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Completion Report (CASCR) provides an
evaluation of the World Bank Group assistance to Sao Tome and Principe during the FY06-12
period supported by the Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 32078) and Interim Strategy
Note (ISN, Report No. 59853-ST). The CASCR is prepared using as background information the
CAS and ISN, the latest Implementation Status Reports (ISR) for projects in the portfolio, and
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for operations closing during that period. The
CASCR evaluation follows the “Guidance to Staff on the Country Assistance Strategy
Completion Report” issued in October 2012.
Summary of Findings and Ratings
2.
The Country Team rates aggregate progress toward achieving CPS outcomes as
satisfactory. Across the broad range of engagement areas, the CAS/ISN program achieved
results in line with expectations, without reversals or deficiencies despite external shocks and
internal political tensions during the CAS/ISN implementation period. The combination of
analytical work (AAA), Development Policy Operations (DPOs), and Technical Assistance (TA)
provided for a stable macroeconomic base where support and enhancement of investment climate
strategies and the strengthening of governance, public institutions, and human capital could take
place.
3.
The Country Team rates World Bank Group performance as satisfactory. The WBG
program grew in scope and size, aided by STP’s membership in IFC. The Bank responded
promptly and effectively by supporting the Government to face external shocks (for example, the
food and global financial crises) by providing additional resources from the IDA- Crises
Response Window. Access to additional resources from Regional allocations, Global
Environment Fund (GEF), and Education for All (EFA) was able to promote private sector
investments, enhance human capacity, and address climate change adaptation.
Country Level Goals
4.
The first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), prepared in 2003, included a
comprehensive and extensive consultative process amongst the key stakeholders. In 2005, a set
of annexes to the PRSP main document provided updates on the previous two years’ of
macroeconomic performance, indicators, and implementation framework, as well as a summary
of the new petroleum revenue management law, and a summary of the PRSP implementation
experience during 2003-2004.
5.
The IMF and World Bank Boards endorsed the PRSP and the related Joint Staff Advisory
Note (JSAN). The JSAN noted that the PRSP provided a reliable framework for reducing
poverty. In addition, it highlighted the areas of weaknesses in the PRSP that could be
strengthened through, inter alia: (i) prioritizing sectoral strategies and making them fully
46

consistent with the annual fiscal budget and the overall medium-term poverty alleviation
strategy; and (ii) launching an in-depth analysis of the impact of potential oil revenues on the
economy.
6.
The CAS (FY06-09) aimed to focus on a few selected areas of intervention to maximize
the Bank’s impact and to ensure complementarity with other Development Partners (DPs). This
selectivity was also dictated by the limited IDA financial envelope which was available for STP.
This would provide an opportunity to build upon ongoing activities and enhance and deepen the
strategy laid out in the previous strategy. The CAS objectives were (i) to continue the
implementation of ongoing activities, especially with respect to social sector service delivery
(Social Sector Support Project, FY04), capacity-building in public finance management
(Governance Capacity Building Technical Assistance Project, FY05), institutional support to
managing the oil sector, and follow-up on recommendations of the Bank’s knowledge products,
and (ii) to gradually move to Development Policy Operations (budget support) starting in FY07
with the objective of strengthening implementation of the PRSP and maximizing IDA’s impact.
The DPOs would open the necessary policy space by adopting a demand-driven and flexible
approach, which is proving to be an effective engagement strategy in a fragile state with serious
capacity constraints. Additionally, to date, the Bank is the only DP that is providing budget
support.
7.
STP reached the completion point under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative in March 2007, thus benefiting from debt relief in the amount of US$314
million from both HIPC the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) 47. Paris Club creditors
agreed in May 2007 to cancel all their outstanding claims on the country. As a result of MDRI,
the activity of the relevant government office is quite limited and it follows approximately 20
multilateral loans. Most bilateral debt has been cancelled. Major outstanding creditors include
Angola, Portugal, Nigeria, and Taiwan, China. Debt Management Performance Analyses were
undertaken in 2009 and in 2012.
8.
The 2006 JSAN Annual Progress Report 48 stressed the need for maintaining
macroeconomic stability and strengthening structural reforms in order to achieve the objectives
of the PRSP. Moreover, improving the business climate and provision of utility services remain
essential to allow the private sector to thrive and promote growth. The Authorities are aware of
the need to increase aid absorption capacity (only 68 percent of the 2006 Public Investment Plan
was actually executed) and to improve the efficiency and transparency in the use of public
resources, including from HIPC/MDRI debt relief and possible future oil revenues in order to
achieve the PRSP objectives. The 2008 JSAN Annual Progress Report 49 agreed with the
importance of debt relief to boost pro-poor spending, the removal of obstacles to economic
growth, the continued policy of refraining from new external borrowing on non-concessional
terms, and measures to promote private sector participation and strengthening the regulatory
framework as important pillars of a strategy to improve public infrastructure under a constrained
budget.

Despite high political instability that hampered decision making, changed priorities and
policies, and caused inconsistencies and delays in the DPs’ programs, the Authorities were able
to mitigate damage with the support of the IMF and Bank by anchoring the macroeconomy and
developing priorities around pre-established strategies. The Government has been making
consistent progress by establishing the legal frameworks and structures that would gradually
improve transparency and accountability in the public and oil sectors including, inter alia: the
Organic Law on Public Financial Management, developing the Exclusive Economic Zone
(2008), reform of the tax legislation, a new Procurement Law, reforms in the Government
financial management system (Sistema de Administração Financeira do Estado - SAFE) to
integrate computerized system (e-SAFE) with a harmonized program, rules and procedures, and
execution control and assessment of public resources.
10.
An Interim Strategy Note (FY11-12) 50 extended the CAS period and revised the
objectives of the CAS to support the Authorities to develop a new development strategy taking
into consideration the uncertainties about when oil revenues would be likely to materialize. The
results matrix was also revised: the original CAS outcomes that have been achieved were not
included in the revised results matrix.
11.
The Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) was published while the ISN
was in place 51 and was endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and IMF (JSAN-II) 52. The
JSAN-II praised the Government for its focus on (i) immediate policy actions and on the
achievement of medium-term goals for good governance and public-sector reform, (ii)
continuing to build upon economic performance through implementation of structural reforms
and barring a serious deterioration of external conditions or other unpredictable shocks, and (iii)
prioritizing reforms that are urgent regardless of whether oil is produced or not, particularly in
the areas of good governance, competitiveness, and diversification.
12.
This report is organized as follows: Section II below details the assessment of the
program’s performance, and provides a concise review of the progress made towards achieving
CAS/ISN outcomes and identifies key challenges remaining; Section III details the evaluation of
the Bank Group’s performance in designing and implementing the CAS/ISN and managing risks;
and Section IV presents key lessons learned and outlines recommendations for future program
design and implementation.

CAS/ISN implementation period. Program performance has to be viewed in the context of
exogenous and unplanned factors that affected STP during the period including the fuel and food
price increases, the world economic downturn and political instability. The WBG, through
remote collaboration from the Mozambique and Washington DC offices, has been able to
support the Government with a combination of analytical work, technical support, and financing
for the implementation of the PRSP-I (2005) and development of the PRSP-II. IDA allocation
during rounds 14 and 15 53 were small but the World Bank team efforts and good partnership
with the Authorities ensured that the funds were maximized.
14.
During the CAS/ISN period, STP joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC)54
leading to significant progress in improving transparency, fostering competition and improving
the business environment. IFC’s advisory and technical assistance has been focusing on the
promotion of the private sector, including enhancing the country’s investment climate in order to
reduce the cost of doing business and attract investments that will broaden the export base. The
benefits of this engagement were reflected in the Doing Business Surveys and Transparency
International 55 evaluations. On December 20, 2012, DTP became the 178th member of the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) following completion of the formal
requirements for membership. Following membership, MIGA is open for business in the country
offering covers for investors concerned about Transfer Restriction, Breach of Contract,
Expropriation, and War and Civil Disturbance risks. MIGA has a strategic priority to focus on
IDA countries, such as STP. MIGA will also seek out opportunities to work alongside the Bank
team. An example of possible MIGA’s support would be supporting the energy sector by
complementing a partial risk guarantee for a power supply agreement or IFC funding for equity
projects. MIGA is currently looking at a number of leads in the country and will continue to look
for opportunities to support investors into the country and develop a presence for investors
concerned about non-commercial risk in STP.
15.
The principle CAS objectives were to: (i) support the implementation of the PRSP and
strengthen the areas where the PRSP needed to be improved, as highlighted in the JSAN, and (ii)
provide assistance to STP to ensure that it was sufficiently prepared to maximize the benefits of
future oil revenues. The CAS proposed a results framework, summarized in a Results Matrix. It
contained the five PRSP objectives aligned to 18 CAS outcomes. The ISN reaffirmed the
relevance of the CAS, adjusted some of the CAS outcomes and included IFC operations in the
program of support to the country.
Objectives of the Assistance
16.
The WBG’s approach to support the country’s development goals was embodied in two
strategic objectives: (i) accelerate sustainable and broad-based growth and (ii) strengthen
governance, public institutions and human capital. WBG assistance aimed at raising
competitiveness and employment while addressing vulnerability and resilience issues. It

To accelerate sustainable and broad-based growth, the program sought to promote four
main areas: (i) consolidating macro-stability, especially fiscal sustainability; (ii) strengthening
infrastructure, with emphasis on energy and telecommunications; (iii) enhancing STP’s
investment climate; and (iv) strengthening the financial system. To strengthen governance,
increase transparency, and build up public institutions and human capital the focus areas were:
(i) strengthening transparency and accountability of budgetary operations and improve payroll
management; (ii) increasing transparency and accountability of upcoming petroleum revenues;
(iii) developing human resources and access to basic social services; (iv) creating strategies and
information to allow the measurement of success; and (v) strengthening environment protection
and resilience.
18.
The CAS outlined a notional lending program that ranged from a base case scenario of
US$5.5 million to a high case of US$10 million supporting ongoing projects and development
policy lending operations. Based on the Africa Region’s Strategy of attention to small states,
partnerships and regional integration, the team leveraged IDA resources to the fullest extent
possible. This framework generated a multi-stakeholder effort integrating the unique
contributions of the IMF, EITI, AfDB, EU and other bilateral development partners in a unified,
holistic program. The WBG was able to supplement lending and knowledge products to benefit
STP with a regional integration operation - the Central Africa Backbone-APL2 (US$14.9
million) funding the submarine fiber-optic cables, and GEF financing (US$4.1 million) for
climate change mitigation, thus increasing the CAS base case scenario by 700 percent (see Table
50

A). In addition, the WBG team was resourceful in obtaining Trust Fund support through the
CAS/ISN period (Table B).

A. Progress on Strategic Objective I: Promote Broad-Based and Sustainable Economic
Growth
20.
The CAS/ISN development goals under the first strategic objective were: (i) consolidate
macro-stability especially fiscal sustainability; (ii) strengthen infrastructure, with emphasis on
energy and telecommunications; (iii) enhance STP’s investment climate; and (iv) strengthen the
financial system. Nine of the 10 results indicators under the CAS/ISN strategic objective have
been achieved; one was not achieved, despite having made some progress.
Revised CAS Goal 1(i): Consolidate macro-stability especially fiscal sustainability
21.
Development Policy Operations 56 and knowledge products provided throughout the
CAS/ISN period enhanced the Government’s ability to develop a culture of prudent
macroeconomic management. The WBG supported the Authorities in accelerating the process of
fiscal adjustment through a series of gradual reductions of nonessential expenditures, containing
the growth of the wage bill, and enhancing the enforcement of tax collection. The Debt
Management Performance Assessment carried out in 2009 and again in 2012 led to the
development of a Debt Management Reform Plan being implemented by the Authorities for
stronger fiscal controls, thus reducing the domestic primary deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2010
and then to 3.2 percent in 2012.
Revised CAS Goal 1(ii): Strengthen infrastructure, with emphasis on energy and
telecommunications
22.
Infrastructure strengthening in STP benefits from the holistic approach and integration of
the Development Partners. The WBG, through the CEM and other knowledge products, provided
the support to the Authorities in identifying the top priorities in overcoming the large
infrastructure deficit. Telecommunication and energy sectors were recognized as the most
transformative and capable of unlocking the country’s development potential by fostering local
potential and as a basic pillar to attract foreign direct investments.
23.
The Central Africa Backbone APL2 funded extensive improvements in
telecommunication with the arrival of the ACE submarine cable in the country in November
2012. With little over a month of operation, the use of capacity has gone up five times (from 50
to 250 Mbs), and given the current cable capacity, it can still increase 18 times more before
requiring an upgrade of the international cable capacity. Average prices are already coming
down (the operator is offering four to eight times more capacity for the same price). Tender for a
second telecommunications operator was launched and one proposal was received on March 8,
2012. In its technical proposal, the proposed licensee shows investments plans for US$16 million
including 25 stations in STP.
24.
The 2010 “Revitalization of the Power Sector and Private Sector Participation” study
carried out with the support of Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the
56

Including the DPOs

52

IFC 57 identified systemic constrains within the energy sector and provided ideas on how to
overcome them. The Authorities have been evaluating the best way to implement the study
recommendations. Amongst other DPs’ complementary efforts on the sector, the Government
accepted a grant from the SIDS-DOCK 58 Partnership and the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP) 59 to fund detailed engineering designs necessary to upgrade the
transmission and distribution system and reduce the commercial losses. A campaign to replace
incandescent light bulbs with Compact Fluorescent Lamps Reduction is planned for FY13 and
has the potential to reduce peak of energy demand in the country.
25.
Although the Bank has been providing support to the Government on the energy sector,
the design and submission for discussion to key stakeholders of regulations to reduce electricity
fraud and theft have not been completed.
Revised CAS Goal 1(iii): Enhance STP’s investment climate
26.
At the beginning of the CAS period, STP ranked among the least attractive places - 180th
out of 183 countries - to start a business according to the Doing Business Survey. Starting in
2007, Development Partners 60 started providing technical assistance to STP for the improvement
of the investment climate. The IFC advisory services started in 2008 focusing on improving the
commercial code, reducing the number of procedures to start a business, and improving access to
electricity and telecommunication services, amongst others. With IFC support, STP introduced
reforms of the century-old business licenses regime. The reforms left only a few business
licenses related to public health, safety and environment. This work complemented the launch of
the one-stop shop for business registration (GUE). The GUE started with 57 new registrations in
2010, but with the abolition of alvarás, many more entrepreneurs were attracted to formalize
their existing businesses or starting new ones: the number went up by 241, more than quadruple,
and then 388 more in 2012 – up by another 62 percent. Improvements in the investment climate
earned STP a spot among the top-ten worldwide reformers in the 2012 Doing Business Report
(DBR) and a spot in the top 50 worldwide reformers from 2005-2013 in the 2013 DBR.
Revised CAS Goal 1(iv): Strengthen the financial system
27.
A Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, and a Country
Integrated Fiduciary Assessment 61 were both completed in 2007, and two Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) reviews, conducted in 2007 and 2010, have provided short

term recommendations which have been implemented by the Authorities with the support of the
holistic program by DPs. WBG, through the several DPOs, supported (i) a prudent management
of oil signature bonuses combined with careful control of spending which has allowed the
Authorities to reduce the domestic primary balance, (ii) creation of a single database with
information on all government employees, and (iii) full implementation of a sophisticated SAFEe software system with modules on human resources and wage management and integration to
the treasury, budget, and public accounts.
B. Progress on Strategic Objective II: Strengthen Governance, Public Institutions and
Human Capital
28.
The CAS/ISN development goals under the second strategic objective are: (i) strengthen
transparency and accountability of budgetary operations and improve payroll management; (ii)
increase transparency and accountability of upcoming petroleum revenues; (iii) develop human
resources and access to basic social services; (iv) create strategies and information to allow
measuring success; and (v) strengthen environment protection and resilience. Seventeen of the
18 results indicators under the revised CAS/ISN strategic objective have been achieved; one was
not achieved.
Revised CAS Goal 2(i): Strengthen transparency and accountability of budgetary operations
and improve payroll management
29.
Throughout the CAS/ISN period, the program of good governance in STP has yielded
extraordinary results. Transparency and accountability introduced by the oil revenue
management law in 2004 paved the way for a gradual strengthening of the public sector with
significantly improved budget, natural resource management, fiscal and debt management,
national statistics management, and the investment climate. Sustainable fiscal stance has also
improved through fiscal adjustment underpinned by public administration reform and the
reduction of the state’s role in commercial activities. Since 2010, the general budget has been
published in the Government website. For the first time in 2012, the Government prepared a
Citizen’s Budget (for the 2013 fiscal year) which summarizes key information on budget
aggregates and explains it in a simple and didactic language so that it can be easily understood
by the general population. The Citizen’s Budget is expected to be approved by the Council of
Ministers and published in the Government’s website 62. Progress has also been made regarding
the comprehensiveness of budget documents, in particular the 2013 Budget Proposal, which now
includes an explanation of how the budget will be financed, including a summary of the level
and composition of the debt stock and information about debt servicing.
30.
Such remarkable progress has not gone unnoticed by the international community. In
2012, Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index 63 ranked STP 72nd in the world,
together with Italy and just below South Africa. That is a jump of 28 positions; the previous year
the country was ranked 100th. STP was the third-strongest reformer in the world in the Open
Budget Index due to substantial reforms in the area of budget transparency and accountability:

54

STP improved its OBI score from 0 to 29, out of 100, jumping 25 places to rank 62nd in the
world. Improvements in the investment climate earned STP a spot among the top-ten worldwide
reformers in the 2012 Doing Business (DB) report, and a spot in the top 50 worldwide reformers
from 2005-2013 in the 2013 DB report; STP also became the world’s top reformer in terms of
business freedom in the 2012 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom. This is a clear
result of the reform program supported by the World Bank Group during the CAS/ISN period.
Revised CAS Goal 2(ii): Increase transparency and accountability of upcoming petroleum
revenues
31.
Much progress has been made regarding transparency and accountability related to
petroleum revenues during the CAS/ISN period. The Organic Law on Petroleum Operations
(2009) has been approved as the principal legislation to guide the granting of licenses for the
exploration and extraction of oil in STP. The Oil Revenue Law (2004), which guides the
management of oil revenues, established the National Oil Account (NOA), into which all oilrelated revenues are to be deposited. It sets a limit of 20 percent of the balance of the preceding
year to fund the Government budget. Once oil production starts, the bulk of the current revenues
are to be transferred into a sub-account of the NOA - the Permanent Fund of STP. These
resources are to be invested with a view to generating a permanent income stream for the NOA.
To date, STP oil revenues have been limited signature bonuses for a total of US$87.9 million,
equivalent to 30 percent of GDP since 2005, from the issuance of prospecting licenses in the
Joint Development Zone (JDZ), resource sharing between Nigeria (60 percent) and STP (40
percent) in 2005 and 2007, as well as in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 2011 and 2012.
32.
Through the JDZ, STP became an EITI candidate country in February 2008 but the JDZ
EITI Report could not be produced due to coordination issues with Nigeria. As a result, the EITI
Board delisted STP from the EITI in April 2010, while Nigeria was granted “near compliant”
status in October 2010. STP was encouraged to reapply once circumstances for rapid
implementation were more favorable, and it could demonstrate a renewed commitment by
providing a clear outline of how it had corrected previous barriers to effective implementation.64
The Government is committed to transparency and accountability and took the following steps to
reapply for EITI candidacy: (i) it issued an unequivocal public statement of its intention to
implement the EITI; (ii) it expressed its commitment to work with civil society and companies
on the implementation of the EITI; (iii) it appointed a high ranking official to lead the EITI
implementation; (iv) it restructured the EITI National Committee 65 and (v) it agreed and
64

The previous barriers included absence of a clear commitment from the Government with EITI, including (i)
absence of financial support, and (ii) insufficient engagement by the coordinator in the process. The Government has
addressed these issues as follows: (i) a dedicated budget line was introduced in the national budget; (ii) an office
space and meeting facilities have been assigned for EITI at the Ministry of Finance; (iii) the STP-EITI has been
placed within the Ministry of Finance and the Minister of Finance has been appointed EITI Champion who will lead
the implementation of the Initiative; and (iv) the STP representatives to the JDZ Tripartite Subcommittee have been
appointed. In addition, a Permanent EITI Secretary was appointed - a private consultant - currently financed by the
World Bank, who has been actively involved in the process.
65
The STP-EITI National Committee consists of three representatives from the Government (Ministry of Finance,
Treasury and National Petroleum Agency); three representatives from civil society (NGO WEBETO, Women
Lawyers’ Association, and Federation of NGOs); the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture; one

55

published a fully costed Work Plan containing measurable targets, and a timetable for
implementation. The Government applied for candidacy in September 11, 2012 and was
accepted as candidate country by the EITI Board at its meeting in Lusaka on October 26, 2012.
STP is expected to become an EITI Compliant Country by April 2015.
Revised CAS Goal 2(iii): Develop human resources and access to basic social services
33.
The Social Sector Support Project (P075979) and the Social Sector Support Project
Additional Financing (P113113) made significant contributions to improving the access of
basic services for the STP population. Important improvements in the health sector in STP can be
attributed to these operations which contributed to building, equipping and making functional a
number of health centers in remote districts, by training health personnel, and by supporting
capacity development of the Ministry of Health. Amongst the indicators for the project are:
immunization rate for measles, the proportion of pregnant women receiving antenatal care, and
the proportion of births attended by qualified birth attendants. Comprehensive donor
coordination, partnership, and complementary interventions contributed to progress in the sector
indicators.
Revised CAS Goal 2(iv): Create strategies and information to allow measuring success
34.
The Government has seen the impact of measuring success as recognized by the
international community but it remains a challenge for the Authorities. Despite the WBG’s and
other DPs’ support to the Government in strengthening the monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
capacity of the National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica - INE) effective
monitoring of poverty indicators continue to be a challenge for the Authorities. In 2006, a Trust
Fund Grant for Statistical Capacity Building (TF056928, US$160,000) was provided to the INE
to support the development of a National Strategy for the Development for Statistics (NSDS) and
improvement of the statistical capacity in the country. TA was provided by the UN and AfDB in
preparation of the PRSP-II; nonetheless, there were considerable delays on the production and
analysis of the 2010 household survey and completion of the poverty profile. Updates and
disaggregation of the data based on gender, age, geography (rural and urban), and socioeconomic
status remain to be done. A strategic action plan to strengthen statistical sector capacity needs to
be designed, funded and implemented.
35.
Based on the experience of PRSP-I and given the inherent constraints on resources, the
66
JSAN for the PRSP-II recommended including concrete policy prescriptions in the
forthcoming Priority Action Plan (PAP) linking specific PRSP-II goals with quantifiable - to the
extent possible - and easy-to-monitor indicators. Support for the statistics and M&E tools and
mechanisms should continue to be a priority for the Bank team.
representative of the Regional Government from Principe; one representative from the STP National Radio; and one
representative from the oil companies. These representatives were selected after an extensive public consultation
with civil society organizations (CSO). A broader focal civil society group will be identified to also get involved in
and monitor the implementation of the EITI.

the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy paper

56

Revised CAS Goal 2(v): Strengthen environment protection and resilience
36.
Erosion and flooding exacerbated by climate change and sand removal for the
construction industry have had a severe and negative impact on coastal infrastructure, tourism
and housing. The Global Environment Fund - Adaptation to Climate Project together with a
national study on climate change trends and future forecasts financed by the European Space
Agency (which has been completed) address the damage being inflicted upon the vulnerable
coastal communities. Community disaster prevention teams have been training communities
throughout the country on readiness and mitigation measures. This needs to be accompanied by a
climate-resilient coastal policy and stronger integrated planning taking into account
environmental and climate risk. To reduce the vulnerability of the most affected – coastal
communities and fishers – a reinforced early warning and safety-at-sea system will be
introduced, in conjunction with improved community-based management of coastal areas. IDA
would draw upon its comparative global expertise in other SIDS (particularly in the Pacific and
Caribbean regions) and coastal areas of Africa to help the STP Government address these vital
challenges. STP would be supported through, inter alia, a US$4.1 million GEF Least Developed
Country Fund and complementary analytical work (e.g., TFESSD-funded Adaptation to Climate
Change on the Coast of Sao Tome) , as well as inputs to other Bank operations aimed at
mainstreaming environmental and climate resilience into the Bank’s portfolio. In addition, it
would also help strengthen public and private sector awareness of international standards and
technical regulations.
III. BANK’S PERFROMANCE IN DESIGNING AND MANAGING THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND MANAGAING RISKS
37.
World Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The CAS/ISN was relevant and aligned
with the Government’s PRSP-I, and the design and implementation of the Bank program
contributed to the achievement of most CAS/ISN outcomes. The Bank performance rating is
justified given the efforts made by Bank staff to address the emergencies confronted by STP
during the period which helped mitigate the effects of the problems resulting from the economic
downturn. The CAS/ISN achievements surpassed expectations and were demonstrated by STP’s
remarkable progress in a number of international rankings. In 2012, STP was the third-strongest
reformer in the world in the Open Budget Index (OBI) thanks to substantial reforms in the area
of budget transparency and accountability: STP improved its OBI score from 0 to 29, out of 100,
jumping 25 places to rank 62nd in the world. STP became the world’s top reformer in terms of
business freedom in the 2012 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom and jumped 28
positions, from 100th place to 72nd in the world on Transparency International’s Corruption
Perception Index, well above the average for the Sub-Saharan Africa region.
38.
The success achieved owes much to the fact that the CAS/ISN built upon the previous
strategies by enhancing and deepening a selective program. The CAS/ISN was aligned with the
priorities of the Government and thus had local ownership. The CAS/ISN included a
combination of strong knowledge products, budget support and regional integration investment
lending which has shown to be an effective approach to addressing structural reforms in this
insular nation.
57

39.
The risks identified in the CAS related mostly with the complexity and management of
future oil revenues; it did not fully recognize the length of time it would talk for the industry to
develop the sector. The urgency in developing a framework for the management of oil revenues
was beneficial for the strategy expediting the development of an accountability and transparency
framework regardless of the political divisions within the country. The CAS focused on
supporting the country’s basic needs through a comprehensive set of knowledge and lending
products. These contributed to significant achievements in improving the accountability,
effectiveness, and level of public resources; and strengthening governance in the petroleum
sector while maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment. Support to the social sector has
been contributing to improving the delivery of basic health and education services with a focus
on greater and equitable access, better quality, and improved local governance of services.
40.
The World Bank team was able to respond to risks to the program through a series of
knowledge and lending programs that build upon each other. Starting in 2007 with an Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment (IFA), the first of its kind for STP, the Bank combined the analysis and
policy recommendations from a public expenditure review (PER), a country financial
accountability assessment (CFAA), and a country procurement assessment review (CPAR). The
goal was to identify the major challenges facing the country in the pre-petroleum era in public
finance management (including public enterprises) as part of the implementation of the PRSP
with a tight resource envelope. The evaluation took in consideration economic developments and
fiscal sustainability analysis vis-à-vis petroleum and non-petroleum scenarios, with
corresponding analysis on which of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are reachable.
The IFA reported on revenue and expenditure performance from 2001-2007, highlighting issues
related to the implementation of the public investment program (PIP) and its coordination with
the PRSP, and the budget process, including findings from the Health PER, which highlights a
lack of allocative efficiency. It also reported on the financial fragility of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) and the possible fiscal consequences for the central budget, especially regarding the
implicit subsidies and tax breaks to (and the hypothetical tariff increases of) the electricity and
water company. The Public finance management system (budget preparation, execution, control,
governance, and human resources) was also reviewed as well as the reform process to address
many of the concerns it raises.
41.
In 2008/09 STP was hit hard by the increases in international food and fuel prices and
was affected by the global economic downturn through lower-than-expected tourism receipts and
donor assistance, lower remittances, and postponement of FDI. The Bank responded with a US$2
million supplemental financing for the Public & Natural Resources Management DPO with
funds provided under the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast Track Facility (FCR FTF) to
continue with budget support while promoting transparency and accountability in the
management of public resources.
42.
The Governance Capacity Building Technical Assistance (CBTA) project (US$5 million)
from FY05-10 supported reforms in public finance management, procurement, petroleum
management, all of which helped build the basic public financial management systems. The
biggest achievement for the GCBTA was support to the Government to create an institutional
and legal framework to formulate policies, supervise, and regulate the petroleum sector, and
support to public financial management by developing the legal framework for public accounting
58

and build capacity to prepare the public accounts of the State. GCBTA closed in September 2010
and was rated Moderately Satisfactory on its overall performance.
43.
The Public and Natural Resource Management Development (PNRMD) DPO (US$6
million), approved in 2008, supported the introduction of modern techniques and approaches in
PFM, and aimed at developing mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of future oil extraction
materialize optimally within standards of good governance. This operation benefited from
supplemental financing (US$2 million), approved in 2010, from IDA’s Crisis Response Window
to minimize the risks of the 2009 global financial crisis. PNRMD closed in June 2010 and was
rated Moderately Satisfactory on its overall performance.
44.
The Public Resource Management and Governance (PRMG) development policy
operation (US$4.2 million), approved in May 2011, aimed to raise transparency in public
expenditures, improve the management and reporting of public accounts, promote fiscal
sustainability, strengthen debt management, and strengthen donor coordination. PRMG closed in
February 2012 and was rated Satisfactory on its overall performance.
45.
The Social Sector Support Project (SSSP, (US$8.6 million), approved in 2004, aimed at
increasing access and equity of the rural population to health services; improving the quality of
those services; and contributing to support for the national program to fight HIV/AIDS and
malaria. They included rehabilitation, construction and equipment of health centers in the
districts to increase coverage; strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health
and training of health staff in order to improve quality of services; and institutional support to the
National Programs to Fight HIV/AIDS and Malaria and provision of condoms, and some drugs
and testing kits for HIV and malaria. The Original Financing also included Community-Driven
Initiatives (CDI) promoted by NGOs. In 2010, SSSP was extended to support the health sector to
consolidate the gains obtained with the Original Financing, while support to the education sector
was pursued through the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Fund. The Supplemental
Financing supported institutional strengthening of health institutions at the central and local
levels. Thus, main activities included building residences for health staff in remote areas in order
to attract skilled staff and to improve service delivery; continuing the program of rehabilitation,
expansion and equipment of health centers, including the National Center for Endemic Diseases
(CNE, the Government department responsible for malaria and HIV/AIDS programs); and
training and capacity development of the Ministry of Health. The Additional Financing also
continued to support CDI promoted by NGOs in the area of health through supplemental
financing because of the need to provide critical budgetary support to facilitate the continuation
of the reform process. The SSSP closed on December 31, 2012 and the completion report is
under preparation. The team expects that the SSSP would be rated Moderately Satisfactory on its
overall performance.
46.
The Central Africa Backbone (CAB2) Adjustable Program Lending 2 (US$14.9 million)
was approved in 2011. As of March 2013 CAB2 has disbursed 93 percent of the total - with all
payments to the ACE consortium now completed. The ACE submarine cable landed in the
country in November 2012 and was commercially launched in February 2012. Within a little
over a month of operation the use of capacity went up five times (from 50 to 250 Mbs), and
given the current cable capacity it can still increase 18 time more before requiring an upgrade of
59

the international cable capacity. Average prices are already coming down (the operator is
offering four to eight times more capacity for the same price). The most recent Implementation
Status Report rates the project Satisfactory on its overall performance.
47.
The Adaptation to Climate Project financed from the Global Environment Fund (GEF)
sources (US$4.1 million) was approved in 2011. This operation is crucial for STP to provide
strengthened capacity and financing to address erosion and flooding which are affecting coastal
infrastructure, tourism and housing and developing an early warning system to disseminate
timely warnings to artisanal fishers prior to fog/storm events. The last ISR indicated that the
project implementation is Moderately Satisfactory due to delays in the Coastal Protection for
Vulnerable Communities and Coastal Early Warning and Safety at Sea components. Regular and
detailed monitoring of the project indicators needs strengthening.
48.
Selectivity and coordination have been cornerstones of the CAS. All of the IDA country
allocation funded the DPOs, focusing on macroeconomic stability, and increasing the
transparency and accountability within the public sector. Since 2008, when IFC started
supporting STP, the focus has been on improving the business climate in order to attract FDI.
49.
Risks related to the extensive influx of oil signature bonuses were avoided since the large
revenues from the sector have not yet materialized. The CAS anticipated the country’s
vulnerabilities to external shocks such as the effect of the world economic downturn, and in
response the Bank adjusted its assistance program. A mid-term review was not carried out. In
reality, the external conditions and frequent internal changes made such a review difficult. Also,
a mid-term revision of activities would have been time-consuming and difficult to justify given
the length of the CAS period.
IV. KEY LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW CPS
50.
The lessons drawn from the review of the CAS/ISN and recommendations for the future
CAS are summarized below.
•

•

•

Broad-based macroeconomic support is needed for successful CAS implementation. The
Bank’s successful support to STP was anchored on macroeconomic and development
strategies based on pre-established strategies, such as Policy Development Operations.
Such an instrument provides structure and mitigates political instability of frequent
changes in priorities in the Government.
Innovation and combination of resources into a holistic program focus on strengthening
governance and competitiveness has been the cornerstone for the success of the WBG
program in STP, a small island state with limited capacity as it prepares to meet the
challenges of an emerging oil sector.
A multi-stakeholder approach provided an interconnected program supporting knowledge
and TA through the integration of unique contributions of the IMF, EITI, AfDB, EU and
other bilateral development partners. For instance, the AfDB teamed-up with the Bank to
provide TA in support of a set of joint objectives, while the Bank’s team collaborated
very closely with UNDP and EU to ensure full harmonization of objectives and activities

and support the Government in the preparation of a new Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper.
IDA should continue to build on recent success and gains on strengthening transparency
and accountability on the public and petroleum sectors. IDA support to the Government
has been crucial to strengthen their ability to focus on economic stability and
strengthening of institutions to address the country’s development challenges and
eliminate constrains in preparation for the time when the oil revenues would materialize.
The World Bank Group’s (IDA and IFC) close coordination during the CAS/ISN period
led to extraordinary achievements in STP as described above. Such close coordination
should continue in the next strategy.
To date, STP has been highly dependent on the support of the DPs which have
contributed annually between 85 to 93 percent of the country’s capital budget. The
absence of the STP Authorities in donor coordination indicates dispersed aid and efforts
leading to meager results. In December 2011 the Government convened the first Donors’
Meeting but no concrete action plan was proposed during the meeting and the DPs left
without making pledges of coordination and support. Strengthening the Authorities’
ability to lead the coordination and integration of DPs’ programs would be recommended
for the next CAS period.
There are very few people in STP familiar with Bank procedures. Having a common
fiduciary staff (Financial Management, Procurement and Accounting) to serve several
Project Implementation Units within the Ministry of Finance would enhance the
consistency and improve/facilitate implementation progress.
Make CAS periods longer and allow flexibility in the program. The CAS four years were
too short a period to show meaningful results; in fact, the extension of the CAS via the
ISN allowed for completion of the program leading to satisfactory results. Considering
that it is difficult to carry out mid-term reviews within a short time frame; a longer CAS
period (say five years) would permit a mid-term evaluation. Experience in STP shows the
importance of building flexibility in the program to permit adjustments when
unpredictable situations, which affect outcomes, occur.
Given the encouraging results of the SSSP and further support of the Global Partnership
for Education, it would be important to keep in the next CAS not only policy dialogue but
also, if possible, additional financial support to the social sectors, therefore, consolidating
current gains.
V. CONCLUSION

51.
The WBG’s support to STP’s poverty reduction strategy led to extraordinary outcomes
within challenging circumstances. Whether STP follows in the footsteps of other small states that
have harnessed their natural-resource potential to achieve rapid, sustained and broad-based
growth, or whether it will succumb to the devastating and all-too-familiar consequences of the
resource curse, will depend on the Government’s efficiency in implementing ambitious structural
reforms and develop the institutional strength and administrative capacity to effectively manage
a thriving oil sector and withstand the corrupting influence of resource revenues.

Annex 6: São Tomé and Príncipe: Financial Management and Procurement Systems
1.
Laws and regulations provide an enabling framework for effective public financial
management (PFM). The 2007 SAFE Law adopted a chart of accounts employing double-entry
accounting, which permits a more homogeneous and transparent recording of financial
transactions, facilitating the analysis of outcomes. Corporate and personal income tax codes were
revised in 2009 to harmonize taxation between enterprises and individuals, simplified the rate
structure, and strengthened tax assessment. The Public Debt Management Law specifies the
processes and procedures for contracting new public debt. These legislations were followed by
elaboration of the chart of accounts, preparation and dissemination of a public accounting
manual and a manual of operations for the management of assets, and approval of steps towards
preparation of the Government financial statements. The public procurement legal framework
has been significantly modernized following the approval, in March 2009, of the Decree-Law nr.
3/2009 and the Law nr. 8/2009, of 26 August 2009 that set up the new legal framework for
public works contracts and acquisition of goods and services by the Government. Its scope
covers central government entities, public institutes, national agencies, public enterprises, local
authorities, and the autonomous region of Príncipe. The new legal regime requires that
procurement should be ruled by the principles of economy, efficiency, transparency and
publicity. It defines open competition as the preferred method for all procurement, requiring that
its non-utilization should be the subject of proper justification.
2.
Public fiduciary institutions have been created not so long ago. The systems of
financial recording, accounting, and reporting of public resources have been considerably
strengthened under the Government reform program supported by development partners. In 2009
the Government created the institutions required to prepare the public accounts, notably the
Public Accounting Directorate (PAD) and the Public Assets Management Directorate. Since
2010, both institutions are operational with appropriate budget, personnel allocations, and
equipment. PFM improvements, as a result, include consultative preparation of State budget
within sectoral ceilings and enhanced comprehensiveness, public disclosure of State budget,
enhanced tracking of pro-poor expenditures, a comprehensive inventory of existing mobile
public assets (including vehicles) covering all sector ministries, and implementation of
government IFMIS (SAFE-e). The new public procurement legal framework also created an
independent entity (COSSIL – Gabinete de Coordenação e Seguimento do Sistema de Licitações)
to regulate the process of procurement, responsible, amongst other things, for the definition of
procurement policies/procedures, for an integrated management of data and information, for
approval of bidding documents and validation of Evaluation Reports, and for periodic audits of
procurement processes. Under this legal framework, the responsibility for procurement
management rests with the spending ministries, through the Unidades de Gestão de Licitações
(UGEL – Procurement Management Units) within Direccao Administrativa Financeira (DAF –
Financial Administrative Direction). At the same time, the law created a non-judicial Conflict
Resolution Commission under the responsibility of the Prime Minister’s Office, responsible for
assessing the complaints and appeals submitted during public procurement processes.
3.
However, the process of PFM reform is still at an early stage and it will take time
and further support to reap the benefits. Overall, the 2009 Public Expenditure and Financial
66

Accountability (PEFA) scores were low. The majority of processes were graded with a “D”, and
five processes received a grade of “B” or above (compared to only three processes in the 2008
PEFA out of a total of 28 processes). There has been a modest improvement in eight PEFA
indicators between 2008 and 2009, with regard to comprehensiveness and transparency of public
finances, and on the predictability and control of budget execution. A PEFA update (2013) is
being finalized and draft results indicate improvements in 18 PEFA indicators, whereas only one
indicator showed a negative trend. Nevertheless, the lack of public accounts makes it difficult to
conduct macroeconomic and public financial analyses and, more importantly, hinders effective
internal and external fiduciary control and legislative scrutiny. The 2013 PEFA public
procurement indicator (PI-19) has an overall C+ score, with the highest score a B on the open
competition sub-indicator (i), and two Cs on (ii) use of less competitive procurement and (iii) the
complaints mechanism, which is the same score as the 2009 PEFA, indicating no significant
progress Implementation and enhanced ownership of the new legal framework will gradually
improve performance. However, poor practices like the non-formal appointment of the members
of the Conflict Resolution Commission point towards a lack of robustness leading to the overall
C+ P-19 PEFA indicator. In addition, general capacity constraints at central level institutions as
well as in the Procurement Management Units at sector level hamper good public procurement
system performance. A procurement performance indicator on competitiveness is proposed in the
results framework.
4.
The Bank program in STP will continue to support consolidation of remaining areas
of PFM, particularly strengthening fiscal discipline through implementation of medium-term
debt management strategy and legislation, preparation and auditing of State annual financial
statements, and enhancing capacity for legislative scrutiny through targeted PFM training/
seminar for parliamentarians. The CPS also proposes to have one enhanced PIU with fiduciary
staff (for Financial Management, Procurement and Accounting) to support implementation of
Bank-financed projects within the Ministry of Planning and Finance, with dedicated project staff
working with the PIU.
