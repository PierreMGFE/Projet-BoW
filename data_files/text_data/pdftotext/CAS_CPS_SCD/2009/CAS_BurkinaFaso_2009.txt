EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I n the last two decades Burkina Faso, a small, resource poor, land locked country, has
achieved significant progress towards development. Political stability and the
Government’s progressive platform o f economic and social reforms, sound macro
economic policies and steady investment enabled Burkina to sustain significant growth
rates (averaging 6 percent per annum) and maintain relative macro-economic stability
Steady economic growth, increase o f social
over the decade preceding 2007.
expenditures and significant improvements in access to basic services saw a decline in
the incidence o f poverty
Yet, Burkina’s economy remains vulnerable and the recent series of exogenous shocks
are taking a significant toll on Burkina’s development, highlighting the importance of
diversification. Since 2007, variable rainfall, fluctuating commodity prices, fuel and
food price increases and, recently, the global financial crisis have resulted in a decline in
growth rates and a rise in the incidence o f poverty. The possible prolongation o f the
global recession, which could involve lower cotton prices, lower capital flows from FDI
and O D A and weaker demand for BurkinabC exports risks further reversing Burkina’s
positive development trend. In this difficult context, Burkina faces the challenge of
sustaining its positive growth trajectory, while at the same time laying the foundation for
a diversified economy and decreased vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
Despite significant investments in basic services, Burkina’s ranking in human
development continues to be low and an unbridled population growth rate of 3.1
percent impedes the country’s efforts to reduce poverty. With limited fiscal space,
significant population growth and the move towards decentralized service delivery,
improving governance and efficiency o f social service delivery i s critical for making
progress in human development. Facilitating a demographic transition, strengthening the
‘voice’ o f citizens and promoting community participation in decision-making are vital
parts o f this process.
This CAS aligns with the Government strategy for growth and sustainable
development. I t seeks to assist Burkina Faso to begin to transform its economy,
support equitable and shared growth and make progress on human development, while
providingflexibility to address the impact of the global recession. The global crisis
presents an opportunity for Burkina to focus on diversification and stronger agricultural
performance and the CAS aims to help transform this opportunity into a reality. The
strategy harnesses the Government’s commitment to improved governance and enhanced
public participation and aims to help improve social service delivery. It adopts new ways
o f doing business which involve better positioning Burkina’s development in a regional
context; strengthening analytical support and developing results-focused approaches to
the emerging issues o f environmental preservation and demography. At the same time,
and taking into account the potential impact o f the crisis on Burkina Faso, the CAS seeks
to support more immediate efforts to address the country’s economic and social
vulnerabilities and it maintains flexibility for adjustments in the program.

To enhance development impact, the strategy adopts a highly selective approach which
i s framed around two strategic themes and two cross-cutting issues:
Strategic theme one: Minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting
growth through economic transformation. Activities will concentrate on
sustaining good performance in the cotton sector, increasing agricultural
productivity, encouraging diversification towards commercialized agriculture and
mining and strengthening regional integration.
Strategic theme two: Promoting shared growth through effective social
service delivery. Activities w i l l target building demand for transparent and
quality social service delivery, improving public resource management and
Strengthening the capacity o f central and local institutions to deliver social
services.
Cross-cutting issues: Given the cross-cutting pertinence o f governance and
demography for growth and social service delivery, these issues will be
mainstreamed into all activities envisaged under the CAS.
I n line with the Government’s request and renewed donor commitment, the strategy
seeks to raise the stakes on aid effectiveness through: continued high levels o f budget
support; targeted support to facilitate the eventual use o f country systems and close
coordination with other donors in sectoral activities, joint analytical work and in the
preparation o f a joint donor assistance strategy in FY 12.
While the overall outlook for Burkina Faso is positive, several risks have been
identified which could derail the implementation of the CAS or limit its impact, the
most important being the possibility o f a prolonged global recession, climatic shocks,
limited capacity and coordination risks associated with the multi-sectoral program. The
CAS sets in place mechanisms to mitigate these risks.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

1.
Burkina Faso is a small, predominantly rural, landlocked West African country bordered by s k neighbors. The
rapidly expanding population o f 13.7 million inhabitants relies
upon a very narrow natural resource base, with cotton as the
only major existing export commodity. The agrarian economy
i s particularly vulnerable to climatic and external shocks.
Burkina’s fragile Sahelian environment i s drought-prone and
susceptible to flooding and external factors, such as fluctuating
fuel, food and cotton prices, which have a significant impact on
the nation. As a land-locked country, Burkina Faso i s highly
dependent on good relations with i t s neighbors for transit, trade
with external markets and political stability.

A.

POLITICSAND GOVERNANCE

2.
Since the early 19903, Burkina Faso has benefited from relative political
stability, democratic rule and a progressive platform of economic and political reforms.
Under the leadership o f President Blaise Compaore - who has headed the Government
through consecutive elections in 1991, 1998 and 2007 - Burkina Faso has moved towards
market-oriented reforms and re-engagement with the international community. Over the
last two decades, the Government has embarked upon a dramatic economic and political
reform agenda, involving reforms in liberalization and the improvement o f the investment
climate, as well as efforts towards decentralized governance. Burkina Faso became one
o f the first countries to be eligible for the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
Political stability and a committed leadership have enabled Burkina to achieve steady
progress on both the economic and social fronts.

3.

BurkinabP national pride continues to be an important driver of change and a
stimulus for leadership at the regional level. Burkina Faso means “the land o f the
people o f integrity”. Strong national pride has not only created a cohesive society, but it
has also engendered a competitive determination in the country to continuously improve
the nation’s performance vis-&vis that o f the region. Burkina Faso has assumed a
leading role at the regional level. The country serves as the host country for the
headquarters o f the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and in 2007
President Compaore took upon the presidency o f the organization. The President has also
been actively engaged in peace-brokering initiatives in neighboring C6te D’Ivoire and
Togo.

4.

Despite progress in the liberalization of Burkina ’s political economy,
challenges remain. Democracy has been embraced since the early 1990’s with a series
o f peaceful elections, however the country i s yet to experience political alternation and
opposition remains weak. Burkina Faso’s political system i s characterized by a highly
centralized state system which remains deeply rooted in hierarchical traditions. The wellorganized and professional high level administration can be contrasted with weak lower

1

level administrative capacity. Patron-client relationships continue to exist in the state
system, hampering the effectiveness o f reform implementation and the impact o f public
debate. A general culture o f top-down governance has resulted in societal deference to
the exercise o f state authority. While social accountability has been reinforced by regular
elections, the high levels o f illiteracy, adhesion to traditional concepts o f hierarchy, and
the l o w capacity o f civil society and the independent media limit the effectiveness o f
independent reflection o n government functions. The State’s dependence o n donor
financing also causes distortions in accountability. Greater attention is often given to
donor demands, leading to a focus on the development o f higher level policies rather than
policy implementation at the grass-roots level.

5.
Rising social unrest in recent times, involving riots over price increases to basic
foodstuffs, national strikes over salaries, student protests over poor pay and sporadic
protests by the military and police forces have caused internal turbulence within the
ruling party and marked a shift towards an increasingly vociferous public. A new Prime
Minister was appointed in July 2007 and the Cabinet was reshuffled in September 2008
to strengthen reform initiatives with particular focus on governance and participation.
Despite civil unrest in early 2008, the Regime appears to continue to enjoy a relatively
high level o f political legitimacy. There i s speculation that President Compaore will
stand again for elections in 20 10 which would be legally possible under the Constitution.
B.

THEECONOMY

Recent Economic Developments

6.
Structural reforms, sound macroeconomic policies and steady investment
enabled Burkina to sustain significant growth rates and maintain relative macroeconomic stability over the decade preceding 2007, however the economy’s narrow
resource base and high vulnerability to exogenous shocks jeopardize growth
performance. Cotton exports formed the basis o f Burkina’s high GDP growth rates
which averaged about 6 percent during this period, significantly exceeding the WAEMU
average. Inflation was kept under control, displaying l o w and even negative levels, while
external assistance (increasingly on a grant basis), private flows and transfers helped
finance current account deficits (see Table 1). The economy i s characterized by l o w state
revenue and a high reliance on external aid’, which gives rise to relatively l o w
government expenditures. The economy also remains overly dependent on the export o f
a few products (cotton, lately gold, and to a lesser extent livestock) and particularly
vulnerable to exogenous shocks, notably weather and terms o f trade fluctuations.

7.

The impact of exogenous shocks was particularly significant in the last few
years. L o w cotton prices, combined with the depreciation o f the dollar against the euro, a
significant drop in cotton production from irregular rainfall and rising food and fuel
prices, resulted in a decline in GDP growth to 3.6 percent in 2007. Due to a good
agricultural season and a series o f government stimulus measures, GDP growth recovered
to 5 percent in 2008. However, inflation increased to 10.7 percent in that year as a result

’ 80 percent o f public investments are externally funded: Draft MDG Mid-Term Review 2000-2009.

of the rising international o i l and food prices. The falling cotton exports2 only partly
offset by gold exports, coupled with the increased cost o f food and energy imports, also
led to the widening o f the current account deficit (including grants) from 8.3 percent o f
GDP in 2007 to 11 percent o f GDP in 2008.
Despite significant shocks, in the past two years the overall fiscal deficit has
8.
averaged 4.6 percent of GDP, mainly financed by official assistance. Public
expenditure in 2008 was reduced from 25.8 percent to 22 percent o f GDP, in line with the
spending exercised in 2004/2005 prior to the first cotton crisis in 2006/2007. Fiscal
policy has been broadly in line with the targets set under the authorities program, as
confirmed by the successful completion o f the third review under the IMF PRGF
Arrangement in December 2008. Starting from a low tax base and through the approval
o f the tax policy strategy on October 1, 2008, the Government has placed significant
emphasis on continued improvement in tax administration to raise domestic revenue
further and limit external financing on credit terms. The tax policy strategy includes a
combination o f measures to rationalize fiscal incentives, simplify and modernize the legal
framework, improve the oversight and return o f indirect taxes, and effectively tax the
informal sector in urban areas.

9.
Fiscal policy did not Significantly crowd out private sector activity despite
annual subsidies to the cotton sector and the 2007 recapitalization of certain cotton
companies. Credit to the private sector has increased significantly on a cumulative basis
since 2004, both in real terms (by about 30 percent) and as a share o f GDP. Access to
credit for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) was facilitated by a new financial
institution responsible for guaranteeing inter-bank credit, which was set up in 2007, as
well as an expansion o f credits provided by the National Microfinance Institution
(S’stdrne Financier De‘centralise‘, or SFD). Also, the issuance o f land titles in 2006-2007
has facilitated the collateralization o f loans, improving the quality o f guarantees.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

10.
The global financial crisis is negatively affecting Burkina’s growth and fiscal
performance. Although the country has been resilient to the impact o f the financial crisis
due to limited cross-border linkages in its banking system, the economic outlook has
worsened as the lagged effects on the real activity are feeding through the economy.
Dramatic reduction in cotton export prices and lower demand are the main transmission
mechanisms, although lower oil and high gold prices are partly offsetting them. The
lower global growth and the decline in domestic cotton prices (a drop o f over 40 percent
in the world’s reference price) have significantly affected the profitability o f ginning
companies, placed pressure on government finances and risk causing a drastic cut in
production by small cotton farmers potentially leading to a significant increase in
poverty. With the tightening o f credit conditions, foreign direct investment i s also

’While seed cotton i s planted in April-June, the seasonal output i s ginned toward the end o f the year, and
in general, sold the following calendar year. As a result, a one year lag i s often observed for output growth
to translate into export growth.

expected to decline, especially in mining. Moreover, official aid may be reduced as
donors tackle financial crises at home.

As a result, GDP growth projections for 2009 were recently revised from 6.2
percent prior to the crisis to 3.5 percent. Growth projections for 2010 were similarly
revised from 6.0 percent to 4.1 percent. Growth is expected to come mainly from the
agriculture sector, as productivity measures introduced in 2008 in response to the food
crisis are becoming effective, and in mining (albeit at a lower level), as gold prices have
mostly resisted the downturn in commodity markets while more mines are moving to the
exploitation stage. Growth is now not expected to recover to trend before 2012. The

4

current projections for 2009 also indicate fiscal and financing pressures, including: (i)
a
deterioration o f the fiscal deficit to 5.3 percent o f GDP (from an earlier projected 4.9
percent); (ii)a contraction o f inflows o f foreign financial, direct investment and aid,
particularly in 2010 (-0.6 GDP point); and’(iii) falling international reserves to 5.3
months o f imports. The fiscal impact does not include the cost o f financing explicit
fertilizer subsidies3 and debt settlement for cotton producers which are needed for a
successful 2009/2010 cotton campaign. The current account balance i s not expected to
be significantly affected for the moment because the drop in cotton is offset by high gold
prices and l o w o i l prices. Also, inflation i s expected to decline to 4.8 percent in 2009
stemming from the recent declines in food and fuel prices.
The cotton sector is being hit with particular intensiq. The cotton sector, which
12.
has not fully recovered from the last crisis in 2004 -2006, now faces impending
bankruptcy in the cotton companies, heavily indebted farmer and village cooperatives
who are unable to make profitable activity from cotton and l o w productivity levels which
risk diminishing further if producers withdraw from the sector. Appendix C provides a
detailed description o f the current situation and challenges in the sector. The crisis
significantly aggravates systemic risks which could compromise the next campaign and
the viability o f the entire sector in the medium run. The Government i s putting together
an emergency package which focuses on immediate measures to save the coming
cropping campaign (2009/20 lo), including: (i)
the extension o f genetically modified (Bt)
cotton seed production; (ii)
increased subsidies for fertilizers; and (iii)
a comprehensive
financial restructuring o f the ginning company, SOFITEX and a liquidity injection o f
CFAF16 billion (around US$32 million) to the company’s credit line. IDA-financed
budget support was increased and accelerated in 2009 to support the Government’s
emergency policy reform and institution strengthening response. The Government is also
preparing a three-year action plan to address underlying structural problems and the lack
o f competitiveness in the sector. Measures will target managerial efficiency o f cotton
companies, improved management o f the Price Smoothing Fund, reduction in the cost o f
fertilizers possibly through a rotating input financing fund, the roll out o f Bt cotton in
accordance with biosecurity safeguards and longer term solutions to producer
indebtedness.

There are significant downside risks deriving from a deeper or longer than
expected global crisis or additional exogenous shocks. A preliminary sensitivity
analysis undertaken in April 2009 shows that an additional decline in the cotton price o f
10 percent4 (beyond the 40 percent decline already experienced since mid 2008) would
reduce current growth projections by around 0.5 percentage points’, with a modest direct

Fertilizer prices have only marginally declined this year suggesting an increase in the overall input price.
International Cotton Advisory Committee projections for 2009/2010 put a very wide interval for cotton
prices, between 56 to 76 cents per pound, within a 95 percent interval confidence, acknowledging that
major uncertainties regarding projected cotton trade in 2009/10 pose substantial downward risks to this
forecast, projections are more likely to be within the 56 to 63 cents per pound range.
A 10 percent reduction in sale prices would be equivalent to a 20 percent reduction in value added per ha
at the farm level (supposing unchanged input costs and hired services).

impact on the fiscal balance o f 0.1 percent o f GDP.6 Also, the banking system could be
negatively affected by rising nonperforming loans as the economy slows, with significant
exposure to the cotton sector. The overall fiscal impact would be even more significant
(up to 0.6 percent o f GDP) if the Government had to recapitalize the cotton companies.
Uncertainty on oil price projections constitutes another significant downward risk for the
macroeconomic framework. A permanent increase o f 20 percent in o i l prices from the
current macroeconomic framework7 would result in a deterioration o f the current account
deficit by 0.8 percent o f GDP on average during the projection period (2009-2011),
corresponding to a financing gap o f US$54 million in 2009 and o f US$66 million per
year, on average, over the three-year projection period.

14.
A number of factors could help to mitigate these down-side risks. The impact o f
low prices on cotton producers will be spread over time by the cotton smoothing fund provided it i s sufficiently capitalized - while new productivity investments in agriculture
would continue to sustain growth. Over the medium term, as producer prices adjust to
low world prices, it i s likely that more producers will stop the production o f cotton. This
could have a negative impact on GDP, exports, poverty and other macro and micro
indicators o f the economy. But Government efforts to diversify and develop agricultural
value chains would help producers reallocate their resources to other profitable products.
This adjustment would thus mitigate the effects associated with the reduction o f cotton
prices, and could have the advantage o f enhancing food production and, therefore, food
security.
Ongoing improvements in revenue mobilization and public financial
management are also expected to help improve the fiscal balance and efficiency o f public
spending. In parallel, the Government intends to develop better targeted social safety
nets with technical assistance from IDA to mitigate the impact o f the crisis on the
poorest, including through: (i)monetary transfers (conditional or not); (ii)food
distribution programs; (iii)school feeding programs; (iv) labor intensive public works;
(v) general subsidies (food and fuel); and (vi) exemptions to pay fees for basic services
(health and education). In order to closely monitor the emerging impact o f the crisis, the
Government has established a special Consultation Framework (Cadre de Concertation)
to regroup stakeholders in the cotton sector and donors behind a common monitoring
process. The ongoing Household Budget Survey will also strengthen monitoring o f the
social impact o f the crisis.

The latest joint BanWFund Debt Sustainability Analysis @SA) concludes that
Burkina Faso's risk of debt distress remains high.8 This i s because the threshold for the
NPV o f debt to exports ratio i s breached in the medium term; all other debt indicators
remain comfortably below their policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline scenario.
Burkina's low export base and the dependence on unprocessed cotton exports explain the
main risk factor for the country's debt sustainability outlook. The impact o f the global

crisis o n the country's debt sustainability outlook is assessed through an alternative
scenario that assumes a further decline in projected revenue compared to pre-crisis levels,
a worsening o f the outlook for cotton, and lower gold prices as the global recovery starts
to take hold. Under this alternative scenario, Burkina Faso would not see a significant
deterioration o f its debt sustainability outlook, and most debt sustainability indicators
would be little affected over the long term. The indicators remain below their indicative
thresholds for medium performers, with the exception o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports
ratio, which exceeds 200 percent. Burkina's debt portfolio i s sound, with no outstanding
liquidity problems and a small level o f domestic debt. In addition, work i s underway to
improve debt management practices through an integrated debt data framework. A Debt
Management Performance Assessment concluded in M a y 2008, revealed that Burkina
Faso meets or exceeds the minimum requirements. Weaknesses remain in certain areas
including debt management strategy and operations, audit and budget execution. The
Government is taking measures to lower the risk o f debt distress by implementing
structural reforms (public financial management, financial sector and business climate)
and through closer monitoring o f public enterprises to avoid quasi-fiscal losses.

POVERTY, HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT
AND DEMOGRAPHY

Poverty

16.
The recent series of exogenous shocks have reversed six years of progress in
poverty reduction and a further deterioration is possible if the impact of the ongoing
global crisis worsens. Good economic growth and increased investments in social
services resulted in a decline in the incidence o f poverty between 2004 and 2006, with the
proportion o f the population living below the poverty line falling from 46.3 percent to
42.1 percent. However the deceleration in economic growth and heightened fuel and
food prices resulted in a drop in average real income by 1.1 percent in 2007 and an
increase in the incidence in poverty o f 0.5 percent in 2007 and 3 percent in 2008. The
share o f the population living under the poverty line by 2008 reverted back to above 45
percent, a level o f poverty not observed since 2003-2004. The increase in poverty
incidence in 2007-2008 was accompanied by increases in the depth and severity o f
poverty', making prospects o f recovery more difficult. W h i l e the immediate impact of
the cotton crisis o n producers i s being softened by the smoothing fund" rising poverty
trends could be exacerbated if the impact o f the global financial crisis, particular on the
cotton sector, were prolonged due to the close linkages between cotton production, rural
revenue generation and food production in Burkina Faso. l1

In 2007, poverty depth rose by 0.2 points and severity rose by 0.3 points: CEM.
The CFAF equivalent o f the Cotlook A index i s within a couple of percentage points o f the annual
average o f the past four years.
The floor price for the coming campaign has been established as CFAF160kg of seed cotton. A
previous analysis had estimated that a CFAF20 per kg (13 percent) reduction in the producer price fiom
CFAF160 per kg of seed cotton to CFAF140 per kg would lead to an increase in poverty o f about 3.5
percentage points among cotton producers. See Annex 6 in IDA report No. 38008-BF (Program document
for PRSC-7).

Burkina’s poverty profile shows that rural populations, particularly households
headed by women, are worst-affected and thatfood insecurity is chronic and regionally
variable. Poverty remains a predominantly rural phenomenon in Burkina with the
proportion o f poor people living in the countryside increasing from 92.2 percent in 2003
to 93 percent in 2005 to 94.1 percent in 2007. Household surveys conducted in 2003,
2005 and 2007 revealed a close nexus between risk exposure, vulnerability and poverty in
rural areas. Households are vulnerable to agro-climatic and price fluctuations and are
incapable o f regulating or insuring consumption levels during periods o f revenue
fluctuation. Like many Sahelian countries, the North-Eastern regions (Sahel, Central
North and East) are particularly vulnerable to climatic shocks because o f their low
accumulation o f assets. Although monetary and asset-based poverty does not appear to
be significantly higher in households headed by women, these households experience a
higher nationwide incidence o f the worst form o f poverty because they are much more
exposed to food insecurity risks.12 Chronic food insecurity, which affected 38 percent o f
households in 2007, remains a concern.
Human Development

18.

Increased public expenditures and targeted social service provision have led to
improved access to basic services. Government spending on education, health and
potable water and sanitation have generally risen steadily (Figure 1) and access to
education and water, in particular, have increased. Gross enrollment rates in primary
schools have increased from 41.7 percent in 1999-2000 to 72 percent in 2007. The
enrolment rate in secondary schools has risen from 19.1 percent in 2005 to 27.4 percent
in 2008. Overall access to drinking water has improved to 79 percent in 2007 from 54
percent in 2004 with more modest gains in rural areas. In health, access to services has
also improved with subsidies for obstetrical emergency care and delivery services and
gratuity for all preventive services at the primary health care level. Infant mortality rates
are slowly falling as a result o f improved access to ante and post natal care by qualified
health personnel and better management o f integrated childhood illnesses. HIV/AIDs
prevalence has decreased from 7.17 percent in 1997 to 1.9 percent in 2008 in the adult
(15 - 49 age group) p ~ p u l a t i o n ’ ~ These
.
indicators are reflected in improvements to
Burkina’s Human Development Index which has risen from 0.259 in 1980 to 0.372 in
2008, with a relatively high positive change ratio o f 0.055 over the period 2000-2006.

l2 In 2003, three in five (60percent) of households headed by women were confronted with a food
insecurity problem, comparedto less than one in two (49percent) for male-headed households. In 2007, the
figures were 47percent for women-headedhouseholds, against 37percent for males.
13
The decline in prevalence can partially be attributed to the following: “In 2007, advances in the
methodology of estimations of HIV epidemics applied to an expanded range o f country data have resulted
in substantial changes in estimates of numbers of persons living with HIV worldwide”: 2007 AIDS

Despite progress, Burkina maintains a comparatively low ranking of 173 out of
179 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index and is unlikely to reach several
MDG’s by 2015. While Burkina Faso i s on track to reach the MDG targets for access to
primary education, potable water and reduced HIV prevalence, significant challenges
exist with respect to attaining the rest o f the MDGs, in particular those related to maternal
and infant mortality. Mortality figures remain alarming with very high infant and
juvenile mortality, respectively at 104 per 1,000 and 191 per 1,000 in 2007. O f particular
concern i s the deterioration in malnutrition rates over the last decade. Burkina also
compares less favorably than other countries for assisted births despite efforts to improve
health provision. The worsening global crisis i s likely to have a negative impact on the
availability o f public resources for basic services and Burkina’s progress towards
attaining the MDG’s.
Demography

20.
Burkina’s unbridledpopulation growth rate of 3.1 percent represents one of the
greatest obstacles to human development and poverty reduction. Recent studies,
including the upcoming Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and the National
Territorial Planning Study (Etude du Schema National d ’Amenagement du Territoire or
SNAT) diagnostic, have identified the serious repercussions o f a population growth that
i s driven by high fertility in Burkina. Burkina’s population growth rate not only
jeopardizes the provision o f human capital investments, especially in the areas o f
education and health, it also heightens food insecurity, hastens land saturation and
environmental degradation and, in the longer term, the expandedpopulation o f youth will
place a strain on the already limited formal labor market. The phenomenal population
increase renders attainment o f the MDGs less likely and more costly and it has a direct
impact on the poverty headcount.

BURKINA FASO’S
OPPORTUNITIES

M A I N DEVELOPMENT

CHALLENGES

AND

21.
The strong performance o f the country at a macro level and in key sectors, the
important growth potential that exists and the stable political environment in which
improving governance and accountability have recently assumed particular prominence
provide a solid foundation for transformation in Burkina Faso. In order to harness this
opportunity, Burkina faces two main development challenges:

(i) Sustaining the country’s positive growth trajectory; and
(ii) Advancing human development through the improved delivery o f social
services.
Governance remains a central component o f both development challenges. Population
growth, environmental degradation and climate change have an aggravating impact on
these development challenges and are therefore integrally relevant.
Development Challenge 1: Sustaining the country’s positive growth trajectory

22.
I n a difficult international context, the country faces the challenge of
sustaining its positive growth trajectory through intensification and diversification of
the economy. The upcoming CEM indicates that the growth effects o f Burkina’s
currency liberalization in 1994 are nearly exhausted. The impact o f the global financial
crisis also threatens to slow economic growth. Burkina can no longer afford to
precariously balance on the undulating performance o f the cotton sector, which renders
the economy vulnerable to climatic shocks and fluctuations in international commodity
prices. The country needs to overcome i t s economic vulnerability and develop a broader
and more sustainable resource base through intensification and diversification o f the
economy.
(i) Opportunities
The cotton sector is, and will remain, a vital element of Burkina’s economy in
the short to medium term and efforts to improve the productivity and viability of the
sector are critical. Burkina Faso i s Sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest cotton producer with
unprocessed cotton accounting for above half (in good years) to above a third (in bad
years) o f exports. The sector provides 700,000 jobs, employs 17 percent o f the
population and constitutes the only source o f cash revenue for many farmers. The cotton
sector i s at once Burkina’s success story and her Achilles heel. Reforms in the cotton

23.

sector have produced a model for integrated supply chain development and have resulted
in significant growth in the sector. From 1995/96 to 2005/06 cotton production increased
by 17 percent a year in Burkina, against 2.1 percent a year globally. However, high
commodity price volatility, low productivity and the sector’s vulnerability to climatic
shocks have resulted in low and unstable income generation and poor land management
associated with cotton production has hastened environmental degradation. The

10

unfolding cotton crisis has revealed the critical importance o f improving productivity,
establishing reliable risk management mechanisms and support structures for producers
and advancing structural reforms to improve the sector’s competitiveness and viability.
While there are gains to be made in improving the cotton sector’s performance,
ultimately over-reliance on the sector for economic growth i s both risky and
unsustainable.
Economic diversification outside of the cotton sector is paramount to reducing
24.
vulnerability, enhancing export performance and ensuring sustainable growth in the
medium to longer term Burkina Faso’s low income level and small internal market
makes it dependent upon exports for growth. Yet the country’s 9.6 percent export rate
between 1998 and 2004 was the worst o f all WAEMU countries and f e l l well below the
average regional rate o f 30.8 percent. Burkina Faso’s limited export earnings are due in
large part to i t s failure to develop non-cotton sectors. W h i l e diversification i s not a new
concept in Burkina Faso, until recently, it has been approached narrowly from an
agricultural productivity perspective with limited focus an post-production issues such as
market access and export promotion. Initiatives have been fragmented and, lately,
sidelined by the focus on resurrecting the cotton sector in the wake o f the cotton crises.
As a result, the country has achieved little progress in diversifying its economy. The
challenge for Burkina Faso i s to begin to develop key areas o f growth and export
potential in an integrated manner, focusing on strengthening identified income-enhancing
products for which Burkina has a comparative advantage and simultaneously overcoming
barriers to production, private sector engagement and trade. In recognition o f this
challenge, the Government i s now committed to concentrate scarce public investment
resources in a few geographical areas that exhibit large growth potential.

25.
I n the medium term, agriculture (including livestock and agro-processing) is
the most obvious source of growth and poverty reduction in Burkina Faso. The
agriculture sector employs over 80 percent o f the population and contributes to 40
percent o f national GDP. Between 2001 and 2008, growth in agriculture exceeded the
national average despite year to year fluctuations. However, agricultural growth over the
past decade has predominantly relied upon area expansion, a practice that cannot be
sustained due to fast-approaching spatial saturation, rapid population growth and land
degradation. Productivity has remained stagnant. Subsistence farming i s widespread,
with limited access o f producers to both internal and external markets and minimal
involvement o f agribusinesses in the sector. Environmental degradation and climate
change have had particularly ravaging effects on the performance o f the sector. To
harness the potential o f the agriculture sector, two key challenges exist. First, there i s a
need to intensify agricultural productivity (including livestock feed) by improving
development, distribution and access to yield enhancing technologies, enhancing natural
resource and risk management and strengthening land tenure. This will enable Burkina
Faso to develop i t s domestic market, thereby achieving food security and reducing the
country’s dependency on food imports in a time o f global recession. It will also create
the necessary conditions for a shift from subsistence farming to diversification into high
income-enhancing agriculture. Second, there i s a need to commercialize high value

11

agriculture products16 by developing tightly integrated and efficient agricultural supply
chains geared towards regional export markets and by harnessing the value-adding
potential o f agro-processing.
Mining is a key driver of diversijication and growth. Mineral resources are
26.
emerging as important export commodities in Burkina. Government reforms in the
mining sector, including a modem mining code in 2003, have already attracted important
foreign direct investments, notably in gold mining exploration. Export earnings from
gold mining rose from 16.1 billion CFAF in 2007 to 85 .O billion CFAF in 2009. There
are currently four producing gold mines and three under construction and the sector
generated 3,350 jobs in 2008. The geographic dispersion o f mineral deposits i s well
spread across the country, and could play an important role in developing rural
economies. While the global economic crisis may slightly dampen the prospects for
expansion o f the sector in the near term due to uncertain commodity prices and likely
lower FDI, a supportive institutional framework needs to be developed to pave the way
for diversification towards scaled up mineral exploitation in the short to medium terrn.17
Active engagement on governance and capacity building are critical to developing the
potential o f the sector. Reducing factor costs, enhancing the investment climate and
engaging SME's linked to the mining sector will likely attract further foreign direct
investment. Administrative capacity within the Ministry o f Quarries, Mines and Energy
and government oversight o f the extractive industries would also strengthen the growth
potential o f the sector. The Government has started by developing a ministerial staffing
strategy, establishing an anti-fraud commission to track gold mined at an artisanal level
and participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
(ii) Obstacles

27.
Despite improvements to the investment climate, Burkina faces an ongoing
challenge to attract strong private sector involvement and foreign direct investment.
The country achieved significant progress in im roving i t s investment climate" and
supporting domestic private sector development.7 9 Comparatively, however, Burkina
Faso s t i l l ranks poorly in the Doing Business indicators (148 out o f 181 countries) and
the upcoming C E M identifies a decline in the investment growth rate from 2.6 percent
between 1994 and 1999 to 1.6 percent between 2000 and 2006, with further reductions
possible in the wake o f the global financial crisis. Private sector participation in the
economy i s weakened by the low capacity o f domestic SMEs and the limited availability

l6A plethora o f studies have consistently identified the income-enhancing export potential o f products such
as livestock, leather, meat, cashew, sesame, shea butter, dried mangoes and horticulture: CEM.
l7Annual export revenues for gold are projected to increase from $125 million in 2008 to $700 million by
2015 and taxation revenue i s projected to grow from 1.3percent to 14-20percent in 201 1: CEM.
E.g. reforms to reduce labor market rigidity allowed Burkina to become the world top reformer in the
labor regulation indicator. Burkina Faso's ranking improved from 125/18 1 in 2008 to 57/181 in 2009; and
Parliament passed the National Policy for Rural Land Tenure in June 2009 and the Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA) has committed significant financing to assist with the implementation o f the policy.
l9 E.g. the establishment o f the National Agency for Assisting Company Creation (CEFORE) and the
provision o f business development services by the Maison de I'Entreprise du Burkina Faso (MEBF).

of tailored financial services2’. Acute skills deficits in key areas o f economic growth also
significantly constrain private sector investment and performance. Acceleration o f the
investment climate reform agenda i s critical and will need to focus particularly on the
State’s continued intervention in the market through regulated parastatals, procedures for
protecting property rights, and the creation o f a legal framework to provide certainty to
potential investors on the responsibilities and risk sharing arrangements in public private
partnerships. The local private sector also requires further capacity development support
(particularly in accessing finance). The Government’s financial sector strategy aims to
address improvements to financial intermediation and access to finance to support the
private sector l e d growth agenda (particularly SME, rural, housing and long-term
financing). Finally, as identified by a series o f recent analyses21, a clear strategy to target
critical skills deficits within the labor market will accelerate growth in key areas and
improve the employment prospects o f youths in particular.

28.

Limited access, unreliability and high cos& associated with economic
infrastructure represent major obstacles to private sector investment and economic
competitiveness. In energy, Burkina stands to benefit fiom access to additional capacity
at a much lower price from neighboring countries, under the regional West African
Power Pool (WAPP), including connections with C6te D’Ivoire (due for completion in
2010) and with Ghana (expected to commence in 2011). W h i l e these connections are
a sustainable national strategy on energy which
vital, there i s also a clear need for: (i)
addresses, on the demand side, the role o f private sector participation in the state-owned
utility, SONABEL, and, on the supply side, the rationalization o f pricing systems for
energy products and services to promote efficiency and industrial development; and (ii)
for improved rural and peri-urbanaccess to renewable and sustainable energy sources.
In transport, lack o f territorial access to the sea, limited farm to market rural road
29.
access, road maintenance and high transport and transit costs are major constraints. The
road network, which forms the main basis o f external and internal transportation in
Burkina i s generally in a good condition22, however, a sustainable strategy to ensure
adequate ongoing finance for road maintenance remains a priority.. The absence o f
competition in the trucking industry, which i s operated on a cartel-type rotational basis
for all operators, i s the most significant contributor to high transport costs in Burkina and
needs to be addressed at a regional level. Despite the revival o f corridors with Togo,
Ghana and Benin in the wake o f the crisis in CBte D’Ivoire, Burkina s t i l l ranks poorly for
trading across borders.23Trading across borders could be further improved with customs
reform and better infrastructure in external ports. Modal diversification away from over-

reliance on road transport i s also critical to improving trade. Rail transport24and air trade
represent promising options for landlocked Burkina. A key future challenge will be to
attract rail and airport investments through public-private partnerships. In the context o f
information and communication technologies (ICT), access to services i s l o d 5 and costs
remain high despite significant progress in the sector.26 The challenge moving forward i s
to continue to promote more effective ~ o m p e t i t i o nthrough
~~
regulatory reforms, I C T
skills generation, better use o f ICT applications to improve delivery o f social services and
the creation o f a more favorable operating environment for mobile phone operators.
Possible regional SAT3 interconnections also provide promising opportunities in the
sector.

3 0.
Comprehensive regional integration remains critical to overcoming Burkina
Faso’s small size and landlocked position.. The country stands to benefit from regional
actions in the context o f an integrated and open West Africa economic space under the
auspices o f WAEMU, the Economic Community o f West African States (ECOWAS) and
other cooperative initiatives. Through the WAPP, Burkina will gain access to regional
power supplies, significantly reducing electricity costs and providing opportunities for
improved regional ICT connections using the same transmission lines. Other important
regional initiatives will result in improved financial intermediation, transparent mining
operations, the establishment o f regional risk management and mitigation mechanisms
and improved cross-border transport and trade through road rehabilitation, customs
reform and improved access to regional ports. The challenge will be to continue the
momentum o f these initiatives and promote new engagements. Efforts to pro-actively
broach regional issues related to free trade, improved transfer o f technologies, innovation
and south-south learning will also be critical.
Development Challenge 2: Advancing human development through social service
delivery

3 1.
Broad-based public service delivery represents the most effective means of redistributing the benefits of growth and advancing human development in Burkina
Faso28. However, public expenditure on social services remains comparatively low in
Burkina Faso, representing only 5.6 percent o f GDP. Given the narrow fiscal space to
increase public expenditures (with low tax revenues and weaker short-term prospects for
economic growth and aid flows), the challenge for Burkina Faso w i l l be to maximize the
effectiveness o f the limited resources available in providing quality social services. This
800,000 tons were imported by rail in 2007 and in 2008, reducing transport costs by half (8 billion FCAF
annually), reducing fuel imports (rail operations consume 3,5 times less than trucks, saving 13.5 million
liters o f fuel or FCFA 5 billion), reducing C 0 2 emissions, road accidents and preserving the road network:

Mobile communication penetration rates lag behind the 2007 Sub-Saharan Afiica average o f

will be particularly relevant in the context o f the ongoing process towards decentralized
social service delivery in Burkina. The specific challenges to delivery o f quality social
services relate to: (i)
the effectiveness and governance o f state institutions operating in a
decentralized system; (ii)public demand and oversight o f service delivery and; (iii)
particular areas o f concern in social services.

Effectiveness and governance of state institutions

32.
Despite demonstrated commitment on the part of the Government to promote
better governance, important challenges remain in strengthening the quality of public
administration and accountability. Burkina compares favorably to the African average
and Sub-Saharan Africa average for the six Governance Indicators constructed by
K a u h a n n and Kraay. In 2008 the Governance Indicators on regulatory quality and
corruption improved. The Prime Minister has put the fight against corruption at the top
o f the agenda and a new Higher Administrative Control Authority (Autorite‘ Supe‘rieure
de ContrGZe de Z’Etat or ASCE), in charge o f promoting anti-corruption, i s already
operational. However, accountability, government effectiveness and rule o f law remain
at issue, having declined in the Governance Indicators for 2008.

Public financial management has undergonepositive changes; yet there is still
room for improvement. The Government i s implementing a wide range o f public
financial management (PFM) reforms contained in an integrated action plan for 20072015 (Strate‘gie de Renforcement des Finance PubZiques or SRFP). The SRFP aims to
create a performance-based P F M system by 2015 within the context o f the new P F M
W A E M U directives. Burkina’s progress i s reflected in the country’s high Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) scores29. Budget processes have

improved, with increased pro-poor spending, the implementation o f medium-term
economic frameworks, and fewer expenditure deviations. The creation o f an independent
Court o f Accounts has enabled timely and increasingly professional auditing o f
government accounts. Progress has also been achieved in enhancing the transparency o f
procurement procedures. However, remaining challenges include improving the
implementation o f procurement and financial management reforms, rationalizing PFM
controls and developing the capacity o f control institutions, including parliament.

34.
Public administration, though generally well-structured, lacks efficiency due to
cumbersome procedures, unresponsiveness and weak capacity. Civil service reforms
that were introduced in 1998 to improve efficiency are slowly being implemented,
however reforms are yet to reflect the shift towards decentralization in Burkina incentive and accountability structures remain poorly aligned and there i s no local civil
service. Limited accountability and capacity and resource constraints also impact upon
the effectiveness o f civil service performance. Although a nationwide capacity
development policy has been created, it i s yet to be operationalized. Capacitydevelopment within the public administration would significantly benefit from better
coordination. The statistical capacity o f the administration also needs to be strengthened
to improve monitoring and evaluation.
35.
I n Burkina Faso, the decentralization agenda is central to improving public
service delivery. There i s broad agreement in the country that the quality o f services will
not improve until accountability for service provision i s shifted to the communal level
where most o f the actual delivery o f services takes place. The General Local
Governments Code 2004 (Code General Des Collectivitks Territoriales) confers
responsibility for primary service delivery on the local municipalities in Burkina Faso.
To date the ability o f municipalities to carry out their mandates has been hampered by
slow implementation o f the decentralization agenda (see Box 1). An analysis o f
decentralization in 2007 identified key challenges to the process. At the central level, the
level o f autonomy with which communes are expected to operate has yet to be clearly
elucidated and this has constrained efforts to operationalize the legal transfer o f
responsibilities. In addition, the complex set o f decentralization and de-concentration
structures requires further rationalization and the mechanisms for intergovernmental
transfers need to be clarified to ensure appropriate, regular and transparent resource
transfers to the communes. At the commune level, limited basic capacity in planning and
budget management constitutes a major obstacle. Local revenue collection and adequate
staffing also need to be addressed.
Improved donor coordination around the
decentralization agenda poses an additional challenge for the Government.
Public demandfor and oversight of quality service delivery

36.
Citizen, civil society, parliamentary and media participation as a means of
bridging the accountability gap and strengthening the demand-sidefor transparent and
quality public service delivery is yet to be fully exploited. High levels o f illiteracy and
management; and (iv) improved budget reporting and auditing with the introduction o f an independent
Audit Court.

16

societal deference to traditional hierarchies have resulted in a weak citizen “voice” and
l o w community participation in decision-making and oversight. A political economy
analysis conducted in 2008 highlighted that civil society and the media are constrained by
weak capacity, limited access to information and few opportunities for real engagement
on decision-making and governance. Increasingly, however, the Government i s creating
space for active public participation in decision-making, as demonstrated by the strong
support for community-driven development.
To improve accountability and
transparency, opportunities for open and effective engagement with the public, civil
society, parliament and the media need to be expanded, the public’s role in monitoring
activities and reform implementation enhanced and the freedom o f information
framework revisited.

Specific challenges in social sewice delivery

37.

I n education, the issues of literacy and educational quality continue to
constitute a causefor concern. The Government has been proactive in increasing access
to education, targeting the most deprived regions and focusing on raising female
education rates. Yet the country maintains one o f the lowest literacy rates in the world
(below 30 percent) and the quality o f education i s negatively affected by inadequate
teaching resources. The challenge will be to ensure that educational quality i s not
compromised by increasing access to education or by shifting service delivery
responsibilities to the communes.

17

38.
I n health, the coverage and quality of services remain priorities, while the
momentum on tackling malaria, HIV/AIDS and epidemic diseases needs to be
maintained. Under the ten-year health sector program adopted in 2001, access has
improved with activities including: (i)the construction o f health facilities; (ii)free
preventive services for children and free prenatal care; (iii)expanded coverage o f
preventive and curative health services, with the percentage o f children fully vaccinated
increasing from 22 percent from 2004 to 44 percent in 2006; and (iv) the introduction o f a
distribution system for essential drugs. However, the country continues to register high
rates o f unassisted deliveries and maternal mortalities, coverage i s s t i l l insufficient and
health facilities remain under-equippedand poorly staffed. Given the high mortality rates
in Burkina, the steady progress in stabilizing and reducing HIV prevalence needs to be
sustained30,as do the improved vaccination coverage rates for tuberculosis, meningitis
and measles and the malaria prevention and treatment campaigns. Malaria remains the
primary cause o f infant mortality and morbidity in Burkina. The Ministry o f Health has
finalized a new fully costed malaria strategy, and has agreed to strengthen district-level
planning tools to better align activities with the disease burden, as well as to develop an
integrated approach to community-level interventions for malaria, tuberculosis,
HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, and malnutrition.
39.
Nutrition has also become a primary health concern. Malnutrition rates have
fluctuated and worsened in the last decade, with chronic child malnutrition reaching 35.9
percent in 2007. Malnutrition impacts upon the high infant mortality rate in Burkina,
accounting for 50 percent o f deaths o f children under five. Although on average overall
food production in Burkina Faso appears to match consumption needs, food storage,
access and diet quality are important underlying factors in the rising levels o f
malnutrition.
A national nutrition strategy exists and intersectoral coordination
mechanisms have been instituted, however, interventions will need to be sustained and
further scaled up to deal with the impending malnutrition crisis.
40.
Despite significant improvements to urban access to water, disparities in rural
coverage and sanitation require greater focus. The Government has made particularly
noteworthy progress in improving access to potable water with the development o f the
National Water Supply and Sanitation Program (PN-AEPA), improved public utility
efficiency, an ambitious and successful urban extension program and the development o f
public-private partnerships between communities and the local private sector. While
access in urban areas has increased significantly, the national program i s focused on
addressing the ongoing challenge o f disparities in rural coverage and the development
and implementation o f sanitation programs.
41,

Social safety net programs are of particular importance in the current context.

The extent o f high vulnerability amongst the population has increased the demand for
Despite progress Burkina Faso s t i l l has one o f the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the sub-region
and a recent WHO report on the country identified ongoing risks associated with (i)insufficient human
cost and rural access to ARV treatment; (iii)
insufficient training o f health workers;
resource capacity; (ii)
and (iv) discrimination.

18

social safety net measures. A significant challenge will be to address the unsustainability
and ad hoc nature o f existing public safety net programs, which rely almost exclusively
on external funding. The preparation o f a National Social Protection Strategy, a law on
social protection and a ten-year implementation plan demonstrate the Government’s
commitment.

The Centrality o f Governance to Burkina Faso’s Development Challenges

fundamental development challenges.
commitment to improve the ‘governance’ environment for economic growth through
regulatory and institutional reform, with demonstrable progress in investment climate
reforms, private sector development and land tenure policies. Yet specific governance
constraints remain in particular growth sectors. By contrast, governance remains a
binding constraint to effective and efficient social service delivery and human
development in the country and it i s in this context that emphasis on improving
governance i s particularly critical. Such an emphasis will be facilitated by the recent
commitment from Government to strengthen institutions and create greater space for
public participation. Appendix H provides a preliminary overview o f the governance
risks in each sector.
The Aggravating Impact o f Population Growth and Environmental Degradation on
Burkina Faso’s Development Challenges

43.
Urgent efforts to trigger a decline in high fertility and slow down the
unsustainable rate of population growth are called for. Burkina’s high fertility rates
and expanding population substantially slow the rate o f economic growth in the country
and minimize the impact o f poverty-reducing and human development initiatives.
Emigration can no longer be relied upon to alleviate population pressure, as it has done in
the past, due to the recent decline in out-migration and the phenomenon o f return migration. In the past, demography received limited attention at a national level and the
coordination o f activities suffered from a timid National Population Policy and weak
institutional capacity. The complexities o f cultural, social and religious constraints to
population control and family planning have yet to be fully explored but continue to
exist. However, since 2008, and with the completion o f the SNAT diagnostic and the
recent census, the Government has taken an increasingly pro-active stance, elevating
demography as a major development challenge. To achieve a decline in fertility, high
level support for population coordination activities i s needed, in addition to a nation-wide
advocacy and communication effort, expanded reproductive health activities (which
address related service delivery constraints) and the promotion o f modern contraceptive
usage.

31

3 1 The C E M indicates that 29percent o f Burkinabe women have expressed an ‘unmet need’ for family
planning, three times the number o f women using modem family planning methods. The rate o f increase of
modem contraceptive coverage i s exceptionally slow and would only reach current unmet demand by 2060.
The C E M recommends an increase in modem contraceptive usage o f 1Spercent per year. Satisfying unmet

19

44.
The promotion of women is fundamental to Burkina’s overall development and
it is also paramount to addressing the demography dilemma. Though gender gaps are
closing steadily in health and education, women’s participation in economic activity
tends to be confined to low salary rural and informal sector activities and Burkina i s
poorly ranked in the UNDP gender-related development index to HDI ratio32. The
challenge moving forward i s to improve women’s involvement in economic activities and
their autonomy and to continue to focus on access to health and education services.
45.
Burkina’s changing environment has significant ramifications for the
country’s growth prospects and for the quality of life of the population and requires
both short term environmental preservation measures and longer term attention to
climate change. Poor environmental management practices have reduced agricultural
yields and the population’s access to natural resources. Environmental preservation i s
further jeopardized by the expansion o f mining. The effects o f climate change are also
beginning to have a real impact on the country, with desertification and lowered and
variable rainfall levels affecting substantial parts o f the country. Given the immediate
impact o f environmental degradation on rural populations, short term mitigation
measures to improve natural resource management and ensure that safeguards are built in
to the expansion o f intensive agriculture and mining operations ‘are critical. Equally, the
development o f a coherent and coordinated national disaster risk management strategy
w i l l strengthen the country’s ability to rapidly respond to environmental crises. In the
longer term, efforts to stem climate change will be important, including through
regulatory mechanisms to encourage investments in renewable energy and reduce urban
pollution and through the exploration o f carbon finance opportunities.
IV.

BURKINA FASO’S VISION

46.

Burkina Faso’s long term vision focuses upon human security (economic,
health, food, environmental, individual and political) and poverty reduction and i s
encapsulated in the country’s Sustainable Human Development Policy o f 1995 and the
national prospective ‘Burkina 2025’ o f 2001. The long term strategies envisage: regional
and global integration; sustainable economic growth; increased public expenditures to
accelerate human capital development; and strengthened decentralization and
modernization processes in Government. More recently, the Government-sponsored
SNAT has mapped a diagnostic o f the country’s development and identified three
fundamental long term strategic objectives: (i)
deceleration o f population growth and
empowerment / advancement o f women; (ii)human capital development; and (iii)
increased and intensified agricultural production and self-sufficiency, (see further
Appendix E).

47.

The country’s medium term strategic vision is being updated. Burkina’s second

needs for family planning would avert an estimated 240,000 child deaths and 5,000 maternal deaths by
2015.
32 In 2008, 124 o f 154 countries had gender-development to HDI ratios that surpassed that o f Burkina Faso.

20

(PRSP) which i s accompanied by a Priority Action Plan for 2009-2011, continues to
guide the country’s medium term development direction, however the Government i s
now in the process o f developing a new Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable
Development which i s expected to update and supersede the existing PRSP in 201 1. The
2003 PRSP aims to maintain real GDP growth above 4 percent per annum, halve poverty
to 35 percent and increase l i f e expectancy to at least 60 years by 2015. The four pillars
o f the strategy consist of: (i)raising growth and equity in a stable macro-economic
environment to reduce poverty; (ii)increasing access to and quality o f basic social
services; (iii)
improving employment and income opportunities for the poor; and (iv)
improving governance with a particular emphasis on public sector management and
budget management reforms.33 Details o f the proposed new government strategy have
recently been released in the form o f a concept note (see Box 2). The CAS aligns support
behind both the existing PRSP and the major areas o f concentration envisaged for the
new government strategy.

BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAST
CAS

48.
The CAS Completion Report concluded that performance under the last CAS
was broadly satisfactory in supporting the country’s efforts towards achieving its
development outcomes. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series facilitated
policy reforms in the cotton, energy and telecommunications sector, as well as marked
progress in public financial management. The IFC’s Doing Business program was
instrumental in promoting significant improvements to the investment climate. The CAS
also contributed to the expansion o f infrastructure networks, including regional electricity
and road interconnections. Through programmatic approaches, gains were achieved in
improving access to education, health and urban water. A notable achievement o f CAS
implementation was the rapid response to the food crisis and meningitis epidemic which
enabled re-allocated and additional financing for extensive seed distribution, school
feeding programs and vaccinations. Details o f performance under the last CAS are
provided in Appendix Bythe CAS Completion Report. A client survey conducted in
2008 identified general satisfaction amongst key stakeholders as to the perfonnance o f
the World Bank (see further Appendix I).
The following key lessons have been incorporated into the formulation o f the new
49.
strategy:
e

e

Greater selectivity and inter-sectoral coordination: The 2006 CAS
aligned support across all pillars and outcomes o f the PRSP and involved a
country program o f multiple projects and programs covering most sectors
and geographical regions. The challenge for this strategy i s to enhance the
impact and visibility o f Bank interventions through a more selective and
strategic program. This i s particularly relevant in the context o f budget
support. While the PRSC series had an effective impact on central level
reforms including public financial management, they had limited impact:
(i)where reform implementation depended upon the involvement o f
particular line ministries and on the capacity o f the Ministry o f Economy
and Finance to coordinate sectoral reforms; and (ii)
in institutional and
capacity development. Future general budget support would benefit from
more selective targeting o f key reforms at the central level. Closer
cooperation among sectoral teams to harness the complementarities and
synergies between sectors and projects w i l l also improve the program’s
coherence and better reflect the interrelated and mutually reinforcing
nature o f the PRSP objectives to which the CAS aligns.
Aid effectiveness: Budget support through the PRSC series improved
donor coordination and proved effective in advancing policy dialogue at a
macro level. Programmatic approaches in basic services were successful
insofar as they aligned support behind national sectoral policies.
However, significant weaknesses in the implementation o f national
financial management and procurement systems represent major obstacles

22

e

e

to the use o f harmonized sectoral approaches and pooled funding
mechanisms. Moving forward, the World Bank needs to foster
strengthened donor coordination through continued budget support and
leadership in key sectors for which the World Bank has a comparative
advantage. Support to strengthen the functioning o f country systems i s
also critical.
Target support to local governments. While donors have supported the
policy o f decentralization, financial assistance has been concentrated at the
central and community levels, with limited support to the governing
bodies responsible for delivering decentralized services, the communes.
Through the Community Based Rural Development project (CBRDII), the
Bank has started to shift financial support and capacity development from
the village level to the rural commune structures. To advance the
decentralization process and improve service provision, better targeted
financial and capacity development support at the level o f the provision o f
decentralized services i s therefore warranted.
Scale up support to institutional and human capacity development.
Given the magnitude of the capacity constraints in Burkina and the
limitations they represent for aid effectiveness, a more consistent and
mainstreamed approach to capacity development i s required throughout
the Bank portfolio as a complement to specific capacity development
initiatives.

50.
Current World Bank Group Program: The IDA portfolio in Burkina Faso
consists o f 14 active projects and the PRSC8 (general budget support) operation with a
total (gross) commitment o f approximately US$534.88 million. As o f 5 May 2009,
approximately US$294.24 million remains undisbursed. In addition to the annual PRSC
series, the portfolio includes major investment lending operations in community driven
development, agricultural diversification, HIV/AIDS, capacity building, electricity (urban
and rural), transport and private sector promotion. Burkina Faso i s also participating in
four regional projects34. 28 percent o f the active portfolio i s allocated to programmatic
approaches in basic services.
5 1.
Overall portfolio performance has been satisfactory.
The Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) ratings o f Burkina Faso projects have shown improvement in the
last 5 years and have exceeded the average ratings o f the Afiica Region. However, recent
worrying signs include the level o f slow disbursements and the absence o f robust M&E
systems. IEG has also recently drawn attention to the fact that the outcomes and
sustainability ratings have slightly dropped in the last 3 years (FY05-FY08). The country
team i s currently implementing a portfolio review and action plan to address these
shortcomings. Project readiness and prompt and effective implementation are strategic
portfolio priorities under this action plan.

THEPROGRAMOF ASSISTANCE
FY 2010 - 2012

Strategic Objectives

53.
The CAS aligns behind the priorities identified in Burkina Faso’s existing PRSP
and the country’s longer term vision. It also seeks to lay the foundations for a transition
towards the new development strategy and a joint donor assistance strategy expected to
be launched after 201 1. To this end, the strategy will be shorter in duration and will
culminate in 201 1-2 (FY12). The CAS i s framed around two strategic themes and two
cross-cutting issues:
54.
Strategic theme one: Minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting growth
through economic transformation. The primary objective o f this strategic theme i s to
assist Burkina Faso in recovering a strong positive growth trajectory and minimizing
economic vulnerability in a time o f global crisis and to prepare for a transformation to an
intensified and diversified economy. The substantial part o f the financial assistance will ,
therefore, support the first and third PRSP pillars relating to growth and increased
employment and income generating activities. It will also support the emerging areas o f
environmental management and spatial development identified in the concept note for the
Government’s new strategy.

55.
Strategic theme two: Promoting shared growth through improved social service
delivery. The primary objective o f this strategic theme i s to improve both the supply o f
and demand for effective and quality social services by targeting binding governance and
capacity constraints. Financial assistance will primarily support the second and fourth
pillars o f the PRSP relating to improved access to basic social services and promoting
good governance. It will also support the increased emphasis on public participation and
local development outlined in the proposed new government strategy.
Cross-cutting issues: Weak institutional and human capacity and rapid population
56.
growth represent underlying constraints to both strategic themes o f the CAS. In
recognition o f their cross-cutting pertinence, the issues o f (i)governance and capacity
development and (ii)
demography will be addressed through both individual operations
captured under the two strategic themes and through mainstreaming across the World
Bank portfolio. Appendices G and H detail the CAS approach to demography and
governance and anti-corruption (GAC). These approaches align with the PRSP’s fourth
pillar relating to good governance and the proposed new government strategy’s emphasis
on demography.

Underlying Principles

Transformation. The situation in Burkina Faso calls for a transformative CAS.
57.
After years o f steady growth and sound economic management, the impact o f the global
crisis has brought into focus the importance and urgency o f accelerating diversification o f
the country’s sources o f growth and sustainably resolving endemic weaknesses in the
cotton sector. At the same time, Burkina’s political stability continues to provide a
steady platform for sustained reform initiatives, national ownership i s developing
strongly around an evolving development agenda which incorporates new focus areas,
including demography and environmental preservation, and the current leadership has
demonstrated clear commitment to better governance and broader participation in
decision-making. The CAS seeks to harness these opportunities by (i)targeting clear
entry points to achieve truly transformative impact in diversification; commercialized
agriculture and social service delivery; and (ii)
adopting new and transformative ways o f
doing business which involve better positioning Burkina’s development in a regional
context, strengthening analytical support, adopting horizontal and multi-sectoral
approaches to address growth and human development in a more integrated and holistic
manner and developing results-focused approaches to the emerging issues o f
environmental preservation3’ and demography.
35 In the case o f environmental preservation, the CAS seeks to target short term mitigation measures that
w i l l enhance agricultural productivity, secure the population’s access to natural resources and ensure that
environmental risks associated with the drives o f growth - agriculture and mining - are actively pursued.
While the strategy does not directly focus upon the broader issue o f climate change, the short term

26

58.
Adaptability in the context of a global recession. The strategy simultaneously
aims to assist Burkina Faso in weathering the storm o f the global financial crisis by
targeting the country’s economic and social vulnerabilities and by partially front-loading
available resources. Sustained budget support to accommodate losses in state revenue to
support the Government’s emergency policy reform and institution strengthening
response in the cotton sector and social protection, will be accompanied by special safety
net interventions (including food security and nutrition). The CAS also envisages the
possible need for adjustment o f the program to allow for critical or unforeseen
eventualities, including the possibility o f topping up budget support to provide supportive
counter-cyclical financing. Given the slow-down in global markets, the growth agenda o f
the strategy places particular emphasis on developing local and regional markets.
59.
Selectivity and improved inter-sectoral coordination for greater impact. The
CAS focuses Bank engagement primarily on the targeted areas o f agriculture and
governance in social service delivery. The new program will significantly reduce the
areas in which the Bank provides financial support. For example, no new IDA financing
i s envisaged for: (i)primary education; (ii)health and HIV/AIDS, outside o f family
planning; (iii)
public sector management reform; and (vi) energy. In these sectors the
focus will be on continued policy dialogue36 and ensuring the implementation o f the
sizeable existing vertical portfolio in energy, health and education. This selectivity also
takes into account the significant support provided by other donors in the relevant sectors,
as outlined in Annex 14. In the context o f human development, while new vertical
financing i s not envisaged for the period o f the CAS, support will be channeled to social
service delivery horizontally along the entire supply chain. The strategy also takes a
more selective approach to budget support by targeting a narrower set o f concentration
areas for which clear institutional anchors for reform are identified. Financial support
under the first strategic theme will also be spatially concentrated around poles o f growth.
The selectivity adopted by the strategy will be accompanied by more effective intersectoral coordination. The CAS will reduce proliferation o f activities and seek
appropriate consolidation through multisectoral operations on growth poles and
decentralized development and a reduction in the number o f project implementation
units. This will require continued effort to work effectively across sectoral silos and
recognition o f individual contributions to tasks.
60.
Raising the stakes on aid effectiveness. The strategy i s a joint strategy between
the IFC, MIGA and the World Bank which aims to enhance World Bank Group synergies
in key areas such as private sector development, investment climate reform, gold mining,
cotton and agriculture. The donor community i s committed to developing a joint
assistance strategy after 20 11. During the CAS period, the World Bank will work with

measures adopted are aligned with the Aftican Region’s Strategy for Making Development Climate
Resilient and the Bank will continue to explore regional opportunities to advance dialogue on climate
change.
36 A key example i s in basic education where the Bank will continue to be the administrator o f the
Education For All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund grant (EFA FTI) and will remain engaged in policy
dialogue with Government on basic education objectives.

27

the partners to bring this commitment to fruition. Improving aid effectiveness over the
period o f the CAS also constitutes one o f the cornerstones o f the strategy. The
programmatic approach to budget support will be continued and assistance in improving
the country’s public financial management and procurement systems will pave the way
for the increased use o f country systems. The CAS program also actively seeks synergies
with other donors. A mapping o f donor’s activities in the relevant sectors i s contained in
Annex 14. At the same time, the strategy seeks to balance l o w costs and aid flow
predictability with flexibility particularly given the current context o f multiple shocks.
This w i l l involve exploring opportunities to provide counter-cyclical budget support in
the event o f unforeseen crises.

3)

IDA Availability

61.
The CAS covers the period FYlO - 12, the last two years o f IDA15 (FY10-11)
and the first year o f IDA 16. The overall size o f the IDA envelope during the CAS
period i s assumed to be about SDR 354.3 million, with an average annual allocation o f
about SDR 118 million for each o f the years. However, due to the frontloading o f SDR
48 million in FY09 in response to the global financial crisis, the remaining indicative
IDA envelope for the CAS period i s reduced to SDR 306.3 million. The estimates for FY
11-12 are indicative only. Actual allocations during these years will depend on: (i)
total
IDA resources available; (ii)
the country’s performance rating; (iii)
the performance and
assistance terms o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms o f IDA’S assistance (grants or
credits); and (v) the number o f IDA-eligible countries. The FY 12 indicative allocation
assumes that IDA16 resources will be at the same level as IDA 15. IDA allocations are
made in SDRs based on performance, and the U S $ equivalent i s dependent upon the
prevailing exchange rate. With Burkina’s three-year Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) average o f 3.7, the country i s currently classified with high risk o f
debt distress and, therefore, it w i l l receive all its allocations in the form o f grants unless
i t s debt sustainability position changes. The country needs to strengthen policies and
institution effectiveness to improve its CPIA rating. A short to medium term action plan
for improving the country’s performance, particularly focused on measures achievable
over the next two years, was developed during a workshop initiated by the World Bank
and hosted jointly with the Government in December 2008. The action plan includes: (i)
elaboration and implementation o f an action plan in the finance sector; (ii)
universal
health insurance for improved social protection; (iii)the full alignment o f sectoral
policies with the PRSP; (iv) effective transfers to communes; (v) implementation o f
recommendations on the study on corruption in the public sector; and (vi) publication o f
summaries o f laws passed to inform the public.

4)

CAS Instruments

62.
In line with Burkina’s good performance, the Bank w i l l continue and better target
the use o f development policy lending. The PRSCs will be designed around three key
objectives: (i)
growth (including support to the cotton sector); (ii)
decentralization; and
(iii)public financial management. The PRSC series will closely complement the
investment lending program by supporting policy reforms needed to create enabling
28

environments for effective implementation o f the program’s major operations which
target diversification and effective decentralized social service delivery.

Strategic theme 1: Minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting growth through
economic transformation
Under the first strategic theme, the CAS will focus o n the following outcomes (i)
sustained performance in the cotton sector; (ii)
increased agricultural productivity and
improved environmental management; (iii)accelerated diversification and increased
exports; (iv) enhanced enabling environment for private sector-led diversification; and
(iv) improved access t o regional and international markets.

64.

Policy notes will include a Country Environment Assessment, Agriculture Sector Review, Growth Pole
analysis and Africa Infiastructure Country Diagnostic briefing note.

Outcome 1: Sustainedperformance of the cotton sector

65.
Given (i)
the impact o f the global recession and structural weaknesses affecting
the current viability o f the cotton sector and (ii)
the importance o f the sector for growth in
the short to medium term, significant resources will be invested to support the
Government to rescue and reform the sector and protect populations f i o m the negative
impact o f the cotton crisis. The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project
(APFSP) planned for FY10 will include a cotton sector structural enhancement
component. This component, together with the PRSC series, will support the adoption
and implementation o f the Government’s three year action plan to address structural
weaknesses and improve the sector’s competitiveness. These operations will also support
measures to protect local communities implicated in the cotton sector, including
sustainable measures to address farmer indebtedness and improve access to affordable
inputs. The ongoing Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) funded - integrated weather risk management study will investigate the feasibility o f
weather-based insurance to protect producers against rainfall variations. The recently
launched West Africa Regional Biosecurity (WARBP) project will support measures to
ensure that appropriate biosafety standards are applied to the Government’s roll-out o f
productivity-enhancing genetically modified Bt cotton. IFC will coordinate closely with
the Bank to identify appropriate support to private activities in the sector and MIGA will
also examine the possibility o f extending guarantees to the cotton ginning companies.
Outcome 2:
management

Increased apicultural

productivity

and

improved

environmental

66.
Increased agricultural production will help improve food security, generate rural
revenue and facilitate the shift from subsistence farming to production for market. The
APFSP will focus on improving access to productivity-enhancing technologies,
enhancing post-harvest storage facilities and targeting food access constraints.
67.
Central to improving agricultural productivity and preserving Burkina’s natural
resource base i s the need to improve natural resource management and resilience to
extreme climatic variability. Burkina Faso has been selected as a priority country for
disaster risk management support through the GFDRR. A country disaster risk
management and climate change country program i s under preparation and will form the
basis for scaled-up support. The CBRD I1 project will continue to support local
communities to sustainably manage their land through the dissemination o f conservation
and productivity-enhancing techniques.
68.
Several regional agricultural projects will also contribute to the outcome,
including: (i)a regional initiative that promotes collaborative efforts to improve
agricultural technology generation and dissemination at the national and regional levels;
(ii)the ongoing WARBP project; and (iii)sub-regional work on water resource
management in river basins (Volta and Niger).

31

Outcome 3: Accelerated diversification and increased exports

69.
In line with the Government’s proposed Strategy for Accelerated Growth and
Sustainable Development, the CAS adopts a spatially concentrated ‘growth pole’
approach to diversification, and commercialization o f agriculture and livestock. A series
o f studies have already identified that Burkina has a competitive advantage in selected
value chains, in agriculture and livestock, mining and tourism and that these value chains
tend to be spatially concentrated, resulting in the emergence o f several regional poles o f
growth potential (see Appendix E). Examples o f these areas o f potential are depicted in
Figure 5. The growth pole approach will be developed and launched during the period o f
the CAS, following the direction o f Government and private sector commitment. As a
medium term endeavor and in order to encourage private sector investment and achieve
diversification and export growth, the growth poles approach will require sustained
support beyond the period o f the CAS.
During the CAS period, the World Bank will work with the Government and
70.
private sector to further appraise the potential and analyze the social, economic and
environmental impact o f developing supportive infrastructure and services in a selection
o f growth poles. The upcoming National Industrial Policy, the Rural Investment Climate
Assessment, the Sources o f Competitiveness and Sustainable Growth policy notes and a
poverty monitoring exercise will strengthen the analytical underpinnings o f the growth
pole selection. The IDA-financed Growth Pole Project will attempt to harness economies
o f scale and synergies between sectors and promote the crowding in o f private sector
investments by identifying and starting to develop a critical mass o f investments in
selected growth poles. A Transport Infrastructure Project planned for FY 12 will support
the national road network strategy and facilitate improved production to market access in
the designated growth poles.

71.
The existing Agriculture Diversification & Market Development Project
(ADMDP) and Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) and the
APFSP in FY10 will support selected value chains in agriculture, livestock and mining
and, together with existing energy projects, may be re-oriented to concentrate support in
the selected growth poles. The promotion o f private sector investment in the poles will
also be supported by regional initiatives to improve access to and reliability o f energy
supply and I C T connectivity. The I F C will support small and medium agribusinesses by
providing dedicated agribusiness credit lines through supported local banks. The I F C
will also closely coordinate its activities in private sector development and the finance
sector with World Bank intervention^.^' MIGA will investigate possibilities for
supporting private sector investment in growth poles through its Small Investor Program
which provides guarantees for investments o f less than USD$lO million.

40

Burkina i s one o f the countries that IFC has selected for its special S M E initiative launched jointly by the
IFC Global Manufacturing and Services department and the IFC Africa Department.

72.
In order to ensure that the requisite skills bases are available in the selected
growth poles, the ongoing Post-Primary Education Project (PPEP) will analyze specific
labor market needs and support programs aimed at developing specialized skills in key
areas. Programs will target improving the employment prospects for youth in particular.
The IFC will investigate the possibility o f supporting private providers o f targeted skills
development. The International Institute for Water and Environmental Engineering
Project (2IE) will continue to support the training o f highly skilled professionals in the
areas o f water, energy, environment and infrastructure engineering. WBI will also
investigate the possibility o f developing a regional tertiary education center o f excellence
in Burkina Faso.
73.
Supporting growth in the mining sector will continue with a focus on
strengthening managerial, administrative and technical skills and knowledge in the
mining sector as well as in major accountability institutions (such as the anti-fraud
commission), enhancing social accountability and transparency and ensuring adequate
support for the management o f macroeconomic risks attendant on the development o f the
sector. The World Bank will assist the Government in the implementation o f the EITI++
through the West Africa Regional Mining Sector Initiative which aims to improve the
capacity o f regional governments to manage mineral sectors in a transparent and efficient
manner and facilitate regional harmonization and coordination in the development o f the
mining sector. This support will involve a scoping study to identify constraints and risks
in Burkina Faso, including those related to the environment, local communities,
transparency and supportive linkages in the sector. The ongoing CEDP will provide
support to the Ministry o f Mines to enhance institutional and monitoring capacities. In

33

support o f private sector investment, the IFC’s mining division and linkages unit plans to
launch a sector-wide mining sector linkages and access to finance program which w i l l be
complemented by a Trade Development Trust Fund study to assess the availability and
potential o f private sector-provided supportive goods and services. MIGA’s guarantee o f
Essakane’s major gold mining investment constitutes a significant and ongoing
contribution to growth in the sector and, if private sector interest exists, further
guarantees could be explored during the CAS period.

74.
To improve the competitiveness o f BurkinabC exports, a regional rail project i s
under consideration and a study into the feasibility o f a new international airport i s
underway. The World Bank will also support the Government in managing the
environment and natural resource risks associated with the agricultural and mining
drivers o f growth through a Country Environmental Assessment policy note to strengthen
the implementation capacity o f the Ministry o f Environment for environmental
assessment and management.
Outcome 4: Enhanced enabling environment for urivate sector-led diversification

75.
The Bank will assist the Government in further developing an institutional and
regulatory framework that i s conducive to encouraging private sector-led diversification
in the growth poles, increasing export earnings and facilitating trade and commerce
through the PRSC series and the ongoing CEDP. The IFC will continue to support
investment climate reforms through i t s highly successful Doing Business Better program.
In the finance sector, the World Bank and the IFC will support the creation o f new
financial services to improve credit access for small and medium sized enterprises,
particularly in the agricultural sector. The Bank will implement the recommendations o f
the 2008 ROSC on Accounting and Auditing and assist the Government in promoting
financial transparency, accountability and market discipline o f the private sector and o f
state owned enterprises. The ongoing W A E M U Capital Market Development Project
w i l l support access to finance and the development o f regional capital markets. Regional
support will also be given to harmonization o f business laws with OHADA. The
implementation o f land reform will also be critical for attracting investments in
agriculture. The M C A has committed significant resources to assisting the Government
with the implementation o f the Rural Land Reform Law, which was passed by Parliament
on 16 June 2009. As a complement to the MCA’s support, the World Bank will provide
targeted land reform implementation support through the growth pole project series.
Outcome 5: Imuroved access to regional and international markets

76.
The CAS program i s framed within the broader context o f regional initiatives
aimed at disenclaving the country and improving access to regional and international
markets. The Bank will support regional initiatives to strengthen trade regimes and
develop regional value chains to complement the program’s in-country growth pole and
value chain support. In transport, the ongoing West Africa Transport and Transit
Facilitation Project will reduce transport delays, uncertainty and costs along the TemaOuaga-Bamako corridor to boost intra and inter-regional trade as well as support Burkina

34

and Mali’s access to the sea. The Transport Infrastructure Project will enable extended
support for road network extension and/or rehabilitation. The regional rail project w i l l
improve rail (especially freight) connections. The West African Air Transport Safety and
Security Project will continue to support the development o f strategic airport investments
for greater connectivity. In energy, the WAPP interconnections with Ghana and C8te
d’Ivoire will reduce generation costs and increase access to electricity. In ICT, the World
Bank intends to support the ECOWAS telecoms program to improve access to quality
I C T services at a competitive price by promoting dialogue on the establishment o f an
integrated regional market and enhanced competition on international gateways,
including SAT3 optical fiber cable.
Strategic theme two: Sharing growth through improved service delivery.

77.
Under the second strategic theme, the CAS will focus on the following outcomes:
(i)improved demand for quality social services; (ii)enhanced efficiency o f public
resource management for better service delivery; and (iii)
strengthened institutions for
improved delivery o f quality social services.
Outcome I : Imgroved demand for quality social services

78.
Greater involvement o f communities, citizens, parliament and civil society will
promote enhanced accountability with respect to the delivery o f services and the
alignment o f services with local needs and priorities. The strategy harnesses the
supportive political environment for public participation in decision-making by placing
particular emphasis on information dissemination and disclosure and public participation
and monitoring. The PRSC series will continue to support disclosure and dissemination
o f accessible budget information, including intergovernmental transfers. Through policy
notes, the Bank will facilitate broad public debate on key policy reforms. The CBRDII
and Decentralized Urban Capacity Building (DUCB) projects and the Public Expenditure
Review (PER) program and decentralization policy note will support mechanisms for
community involvement in local decision-making and monitoring. The follow-on
Decentralized Development project w i l l institutionalize local accountability in the
decentralization process by: (i)strengthening the capacity o f communes to use
participatory approaches in the design and monitoring o f local development plans and
service delivery; (ii)
developing clear guidelines for the regular dissemination o f public
resource expenditure information at both central and local levels; (iii)instituting an
effective and standardized complaints mechanism; and (iv) establishing regular and
systematic data collection at the local level to monitor the performance o f the communes.
The inclusion o f civil society and local communities in monitoring Bank operations will
be scaled up during the CAS period, through Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF)
and Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) funding. The World Bank will also embark
upon a more inclusive and participatory outreach program for civil society and the media.
79.
WBI will support initiatives to strengthen the oversight capabilities o f the media
and the parliament and will investigate the possibility o f facilitating learning, knowledge
sharing, and advisory assistance through peer-to-peer media networks. W B I w i l l also

35

explore further opportunities to enhance the National Assembly’s ability to effectively
perform its functions, particularly with regard to oversight o f the budget and
implementation and performance o f sectoral policies and programs, including mining.
Outcome 2: Enhanced efficiencv of public resource management for better service
deliverv

80.
A focus o f t h i s outcome will be to strengthen public financial management and
procurement systems. During the CAS period, the Bank will support capacity
development initiatives and additional reforms to facilitate the eventual shift towards
increased use o f country systems, through the PRSC series, a PEFA Assessment in FY11
and other interventions (see Box 3). A multi-donor supported programmatic PER started
in FY09 will analyze the impact o f the decentralization o f basic service delivery on the
transparency, efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditure, particularly at the local
level. Additional PFM support for decentralized local government will be provided
through the ongoing Administrative Capacity Building Project (ACBP), CBRDII and
DUCB projects and through a PEFA Assessment on Ouagadougou. As a corollary to
this, and drawing upon the present enabling environment on anti-comption, the World
Bank will provide support to strengthening and rationalizing PFM control and oversight
mechanisms. This will include continued support to the new ASCE41 and to the quality
o f reporting by the Court o f Accounts.

The ASCE has already responded positively to ongoing IDF-funded support. Given the innovative form
o f the ASCE, which combines anti-corruption responsibilities with overall responsibility for the internal
audit and oversight bodies in Burkina Faso, there i s real potential to develop the institution as a best
practice example in the SSA Francophone region, which i s otherwise characterized by extensive
institutional fiagmentation and jurisdictional conflicts between IGE/IGF/technical inspectorates and Courts
o f Account.
41

36

Outcome 3: Strengthened institutions for improved delivery of quality social services

81.
IDA will support both central and local levels in achieving functional and
effective decentralized service delivery. At the central level, the Bank will support the
Government in developing operational aspects o f i t s decentralization agenda, including
an effective inter-governmental transfer structure, through the PER programmatic series,
technical assistance and budget support. It will also strengthen central administrative
capacity to effectively implement the decentralization process through the ACBP. The
education sector i s the furthest advanced sector in implementing the decentralization o f
social services, having already commenced fiscal transfers to urban communes. Through
the PRSC series and the Education Fast-Track Initiative, the Bank will support the
Education Ministry in ongoing efforts to rationalize and coordinate the devolution o f
education service delivery to the communes. The ongoing IDA financed Statcap
Program aims to enhance the collection and analysis o f reliable core national statistical
data.
At a local level, IDA will focus on making decentralization work by: (i)
82.
supporting the development o f local commune capacities to deliver quality social
providing communes with resources to finance local development priorities
services; (ii)
and; (iii)strengthening capacity in the context o f local community-managed services,
including School-Based Management models. Drawing upon a capacity assessment o f
communes conducted by the PER, the existing projects on urban and rural decentralized
support, DUCB and CBRDII, will be adjusted to facilitate a comprehensive capacity
development program for all rural and urban communes, including those urban
communes which are currently not covered by either project.
The follow-on
Decentralized Development project in FY10 will consolidate the DUCB and CBRDII
capacity development activities and directly finance priority local development
investments at the commune level.

Under the existing portfolio (Education for All Fast-Track Initiative, Health
83.
Services Support Program and CBRDII), IDA will continue to target vulnerable
populations through support to the delivery o f critical basic services, including literacy,
nutrition (including quality and quantity) and social safety nets. Technical assistance for
review existing social safety
a review o f social safety nets4* commenced in FY09 will (i)
net programs and make policy recommendations to improve their effectiveness; and (ii)
assist the Government to develop a framework for policy discussion and consensusbuilding among various stakeholders on the role o f safety nets. As a follow on to the
review and where needed, budget support funds will be reserved to increase the scope o f
safety nets. A Health Status Report will also be conducted in FY12. To support the
urban expansion o f the capital city and to extend the significant achievements o f IDA’S
earlier support to the Ouagadougou Water Supply project, the FY09 Urban Water and
Sanitation project w i l l be implemented during the CAS period.
84.
IFC’s engagement through the Health in Africa and Afiica Schools initiatives will
target improving access to finance for SME private health and education providers
42

The scope o f the review will focus upon non-contributive transfers to poor and vulnerable people.

37

respectively in order to increase the quality and supply o f private health and education
services in the country. In FYlO/l 1 I F C will seek opportunities to partner with local
financial intermediaries to increase financing to these sectors and provide the relevant
technical assistance to the private providers to enhance their management capacity and
thus their eligibility for financing. I F C expects to support the Government in exploring
further opportunities to promote private sector involvement in the health sector in FY 10.

The cross-cutting issues
(i) Demography

85.
Both strategic themes will be influenced by the cross-cutting imperative for
decelerated population growth. The first strategic theme will place particular emphasis
on the promotion o f women in economic activities and revenue generation, under the
CBRDII project and APFSP. The I F C will also support a study into the economic
autonomy o f women and will explore micro-financing opportunities directed at women.
Under the second strategic theme, the education, health and community driven
development projects include components to improve female literacy and education;
enhance women’s involvement in governance; address the issue o f female genital
mutilation and increase access to reproductive and sexual health services, including
family planning.
86.
As a cross-cutting issue, the Bank will use its comparative advantage to advance
policy dialogue, support further analytical work into the determinants o f population
growth and provide technical assistance for the Government to update i t s policies and
communication strategies, in close collaboration with other donors. In addition, an IDAfinanced Reproductive Health operation is planned in FYlO to support quick gains in
meeting the pent-up demand for access to modern contraceptives. The introduction o f the
demographic change filter, which is an innovative and untested mechanism, will be
piloted across Bank operations to ensure that all lending and non-lending activities take
demography into account. This holistic approach to demography i s explained in detail in
Appendix F.
(io Governance and Capacity Development

87.
Governance and capacity development form the basis o f the second strategic
theme on sharing growth through improved service delivery, with operations targeted at
core governance issues. However, the CAS program also includes measures to address
governance and capacity development constraints to growth under the first strategic
theme. Given (a) the cross-cutting relevance o f governance and capacity development to
Burkina’s development; (b) the positive G A C enabling environment that currently exists;
and (c) the importance o f reinforcing the message that “governance i s everybody’s
business”- the CAS also seeks to mainstream a strategic approach to governance and
capacity development throughout the country program. The GPF-funded Mainstreaming
Governance and Capacity Development project aims to strengthen this mainstreaming
agenda by promoting (i)
smart project designs which take into account political economy

38

realities; (ii)capacity needs assessment and appropriate planning o f project fund
allocations for capacity development; (iii)
synergies with Bank operations and country
systems; (iv) data collection enhancements; (v) proactive supervisioh; (vi) ongoing
outreach to stakeholders for improved accountability and transparency; and (vii) local
participatory monitoring mechanisms, in all Bank operations. A GovID filter and
taskforce will be created under the project to support and guide the country team with
mainstreaming. The strategy’s overall approach to addressing both general and sectorspecific governance and capacity development risks through the GovID filter, dialogue
and particular operations i s detailed in Appendix H. WBI will also investigate
possibilities for supporting the integration o f Burkina Faso into regional capacity
development and governance networks to strengthen regional institutions.

c.

DEVELOPMENT
PARTNERS AND AID EFFECTIVENESS

88.
The Government has recently asserted i t s leadership role in coordinating
development assistance in Burkina Faso both under the existing PRSP and around a
revised development strategy expected in 2011. For the monitoring o f the existing PRSP,
the Government and donors have recently formed a ‘troika’ leadership body consisting o f
three donors to represent the development partners. The World Bank has been selected
as one o f the three troika members for FY10. The donor community, including the
World Bank, has also committed to developing a joint assistance strategy aligned with the
new government strategy. General budget support w i l l continue to be embedded in the
General Budget Support Framework (Cadre General d ’Organisation des Appuis
Budgetaires or CGAB), an organizational framework for coordinating and harmonizing
budget support between the Government and relevant donors. The PRSC series will be
fully aligned with the joint CGAB calendar and the joint performance matrix o f the
CGAB donors. However, to provide real time support in the event o f emerging crises,
avenues for counter-cyclical budget support will be explored.
89.
One o f the top priorities o f the CAS i s to assist the Government in strengthening
country systems in order to facilitate their use in donor-financed projects. The Bank will
also lead sectoral donor dialogue through i t s chair positions in the budget support,
education, public financial management and decentralization sector groups. Durin the
CAS period, particular focus will be placed upon promoting joint analytical work4! In
accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the strategy also seeks to
promote greater involvement o f civil society and the private sector.

43 E.g. PER FY09 conducted in partnership with other partners including the EU, AfDB, UNICEF and IMF;
planned African Ministers Council o f Water Country Status Overview o f Water Supply and Sanitation and
a UN-Water Global Annual Assessment o f Sanitation and Drinking-Water will include WB, AfDB,
UNICEF and WHO.

RESULTS MONITORING
AND MANAGEMENT

The CAS maintains a strong focus o n managing for development results.
90.
Drawing upon the experience o f the last CAS, the results framework has been carefully
structured t o incorporate the most relevant and effective indicators for monitoring
progress. Participatory reviews o f progress o n meeting the CAS outcomes will take place
regularly and will be closely aligned with the annual joint review o f the PRSP and the
budget support implementation. The focus on mutual accountability at the country level
will be complemented by annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs),
which will focus greater attention o n trust fund programs and their synergies with the rest

40

o f the program. The country team’s participation in the Results Platform pilot will allow
a close monitoring o f the portfolio44and continuous monitoring o f CAS outcomes.

91.
In order to address M&E shortcomings identified by the CPPR (2008) and the
M&E review conducted in 2009, the country team will make M&E the focus o f portfolio
management under the CAS. An M&E action plan has recently been introduced and
targets: (i)the retrofitting o f M&E systems to align with CAS objectives, through midt e r m reviews and regular supervision; (ii)the inclusion o f robust M&E systems in
pipeline projects; and (iii)
quarterly portfolio reviews in collaboration with the Ministry
o f Finance. The Bank Group will also strengthen monitoring and evaluation o f projects
through greater inclusion o f civil society and local communities. The CAS monitoring
system i s closely aligned with the ongoing development o f the national statistical
capacity. As a troika representative o f development partners for FY10 and generally, the
Bank will continue to work closely with other main development partners to support the
Government’s efforts to make more effective and operational the national M&E system
for PRS implementation.
VI.

MANAGING R I S K S

92.
A prolonged global recession constitutes the most significant risk to the
economy, particularly in the cotton sector. Volatility in commodities prices, lower
capital flows from FDI and O D A and weaker demand for BurkinabC exports will affect
revenue generation, growth and public finances, as well as private sector activity. The
strategy attempts to mitigate these risks by adopting realistic projections and targeting
economic and social vulnerability. The focus on restoring balances in the cotton sector,
improving transparency, accountability and financial management and supporting a more
effective social safety net structure will cushion the effect o f the economic downturn on
the population and protect critical expenditure in the context o f limited resources. As in
previous strategies, the CAS retains significant flexibility to cushion a deeper than
expected or more prolonged impact through program adjustments and possible top ups
for countercyclical budget support financing.
Burkina Faso’s vulnerability to climatic shocks. As demonstrated during the
93,
2007 droughts and floods, climatic shocks impact upon food security, poverty and export
earnings in Burkina Faso. W h i l e there i s little that the Bank can do to prevent these
shocks, the strategy envisages support to both ex-ante risk reduction (including weatherbased insurance, land and water resource management and early warning systems) and
post-facto mitigation through the provision o f social safety nets, as well as technical
assistance support to environmental management institutional development. The
program aligns clearly behind the new broader African Region Strategy for Making
Development Climate Resilient.

44

The Results Platform pilot uses outputloutcome indicators which are selected to reflect the Bank’s
contribution, and are based, as far as possible, on agreed and standardized indicators with other
development partners (AfDB, DFID, ADB, OECD). They also include harmonized indicators for health,
education, transport and water, established by the respective Sector Boards.

41

94.
While the risks of internal political turmoil remain low despite prospective
Presidential elections, sub-regional political insecurity continues to threaten trade
competitiveness. To mitigate the risk associated with elections, the CAS i s firmly
grounded in the longer term national vision and i s unlikely to be substantially affected by
changes o f government or policy. The CAS i s realistic about the possibility that national
elections may delay reform agendas in the short term and it seeks to lay the foundations
for likely invigorated reform implementation following the conferral o f a new electoral
mandate. In mitigation o f possible regional political instability, the CAS supports
regional integration and the opening up o f corridors to Ghana, M a l i and Benin.

95.
Public sector capacity constraints can constitute a challenge to successful CAS
implementation. Weak lower level and decentralized administrative capacity represents
one o f the most significant obstacles to reform and CAS program implementation. The
strategy seeks to mitigate this risk by mainstreaming a consistent approach to capacity
development that targets deep systemic weaknesses, throughout the country program,
through the use o f the innovative GovID filter. Significant resources will be allocated to
developing decentralized government and administrative capacity in particular.

96.

Spatially concentrating multi-sectoral investments in selected growth poles
carry important risks. The selection o f growth pole locations could be subjected to elite
capture. Further, the success o f the approach in crowding in private sector investment
could be jeopardized by a lack o f or limited private sector up-take, particularly given the
current global financial crisis. Despite these fairly significant risks, the Government’s
commitment to the growth pole approach represents an opportunity for transformation
and greater development impact. The strategy places particular emphasis on the
collaborative and participatory selection and design o f the growth poles to mitigate the
potential for elite capture or lack o f private sector up-take. Drawing upon the already
strong analytical base, further analysis and technical assistance will be provided to
support the Government in the objective and well-researched selection o f growth pole
areas. The team will also work closely with the Government, the private sector and local
communities to ensure that there i s adequate commitment and private sector interest. As
the growth pole approach i s a medium term endeavor, the strategy remains realistic as to
the limited prospects for short-term results.

97.
Multi-sectoral program management in growth poles and decentralized
development will require changes to the way in which the Government, World Bank
and key stakeholders currently operate. Particular risks are associated with: (i)
the
difficulties in integrating the vertical focus o f sectors with the horizontal approach
adopted by the CAS; (ii)limited government capacity to implement multi-sectoral
the difficulties in ensuring coordination between the sectors at the
interventions; and (iii)
stakeholder and country team level. The Government has demonstrated a clear
commitment for engagement in multi-sectoral activities under the new development
strategy, to which donors have agreed to align. The strategy seeks to strengthen program
implementation capacity in executing agencies and institutions.
Strong country
management leadership and demonstrated commitment on the part o f the country team

42

will also facilitate program management at a country team level, together with plans to
further decentralize Bank staff.

A. Introduction
This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the effectiveness o f the World Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy for Burkina Faso (CAS) covering the FY06-09 period and
highlights the lessons learned. The CAS was designed to support the implementation o f
the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved in 2004. A Country
Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) was prepared on June 13, 2007. This
report covers the period FY06- first half o f FY09 and its findings will inform the new
CAS in preparation for FY10.
B. Burkina Faso’s Development Objectives
1.
Burkina’s Faso’s long term strategic objectives are linked to the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) targets for sustained pro-poor growth; poverty reduction
and raised life expectancy. The four pillars o f the strategy are: (i)
raising growth and
equity in a stable macro-economic environment to reduce poverty; (ii)
increasing access
to and quality o f basic social services; (iii)improving employment and income
opportunities for the poor; and (iv) improving governance with a particular emphasis on
public sector management and budget management reforms.
2.
Despite slower economic growth in the last couple of years and a recent
increase in the incidence of poverty, Burkina Faso has performed well over the
period.
PRSP implementation has been characterized by a relatively stable
macroeconomic environment (notwithstanding the difficult external environment),
structural reforms in the cotton, energy and telecommunications sectors, improvements to
the investment climate and investments linked to the realization o f the MDGs. Burkina
Faso’s CPIA rating remains relatively high at 3.7. The Government responded well to
the series o f crises, implementing emergency measures in the cotton sector and elevating
the longer term strategic importance o f boosting agricultural production and food
security.45

The Government aims to achieve a ‘green revolution’ through the development o f market-integrated
agriculture and competitive agro-industrial products through diversification, intensification and increased
output in high-value added goods. (2007).

3.

The 2006 CAS outcomes were appropriately aligned to supporting the
country’s longer term strategic goals and program lending allocations reflected
national priorities. The CAS aligned World Bank support to all four o f the PRS pillars,
using a blend o f analytic work and investment and policy-based lending instruments.
Importantly, the World Bank demonstrated flexibility in adjusting i t s operations to
changing country priorities over the period. Heavy flooding in 2007, combined with
rising fuel and food prices, a crisis in the country’s main export sector, the cotton sector,
and the global financial crisis created unforeseen short term country needs and repositioned certain long term national strategic goals. The World Bank supported safety
net measures through: (i)
the re-allocation o f existing project funds for seed distribution;
(ii)
additional financing in FY08 for community nutrition and school feeding programs;
and (iii)additional financing in the health sector to enable a rapid response to the
meningitis outbreak in 2008. The World Bank also tailored upcoming budget support
and re-oriented the focus o f certain investment projects, such as the Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development Project (CEDP), to re-align Bank support with Burkina Faso’s
evolving strategic goals. Increased emphasis was placed on stabilizing the performance
o f the cotton sector, improving, supporting the growing mining sector, and enhancing
governance and anti-corruption measures. These revised priorities were accommodated
by adjustments in the design o f the proposed portfolio, accordingly no revision o f the
strategy was required.

4.
The country’s long term strategic objectives have hitherto failed to address
the major development constraint of rapid and uncontrolled population growth in
Burkina. Recent studies, including the Government-sponsored Etude du Schema
National D’Amenagement du Territoire (SNAT) and the upcoming Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) reveal the major challenges Burkina’s population growth poses for
i t s development. Neither the PRSP nor Burkina Faso’s longer term strategies (e.g.
Burkina Faso Vision 2025) identify demography as a constraint for which immediate
interventions are required. This issue should be addressed in the next CAS.
B. Country Assistance Strategy Progress and Outcomes
Overall progress achieved in implementing the CAS i s satisfactory. 16 key
5.
indicators /outcomes were identified in the CAS Results Matrix to monitor the
effectiveness o f the Bank’s implementation o f the 2006 CAS. Performance against the
CAS outcome indicators i s positive as reflected in Table 1. The stronger focus on results
adopted by the CAS was successful in enhancing the monitorability and evaluability o f
the CAS itself. However a discrete measurement o f the World Bank’s contribution
towards the PRS outcomes to which the CAS i s aligned i s difficult to assess because:

a. Certain indicators in the CAS Results Matrix are influenced by the
activities o f other donors, particularly in the case o f better harmonized
sectors, such as health, education and budget support.
b. Certain projects did not have adequate mechanisms in place to measure
some o f the CAS indicators (due to poorly aligned project indicators or

59

weaknesses in data collection). During the next CAS period, the design o f
projects should better incorporate CAS outcomes and indicators.
c. The contributions o f some Bank operations were not captured by
indicators in the CAS Results Matrix. The mid-term review o f the CAS
could be better utilized to fine-tune the results-framework.

CAS implementation was supported by a generally appropriate selection of
6.
analytical and lending instruments. IDA support under the CAS shifted the focus from
traditional projects, delivering support instead through participatory analytic work,
expanded development policy lending, basket fund subhector-wide approaches and
community-driven development mechanisms. Budget support amounted to 52 percent o f
IDA spending and 28 percent o f the active portfolio in December 2008 consisted o f
programmatic investments in basic services. The channeling o f resources through the
budget instead o f projects strengthened the decision-making capabilities o f the
Government and enhanced Government ownership, and financial management and
accountability and offered sufficient flexibility to accommodate changes. Specific
program and project lending allowed targeted investments in priority areas. The selection
o f instruments also enabled the Bank to directly support different levels o f government,
including central, sector-wide, district, commune and village levels.

7.
The sequencing o f analytical and lending services enabled the Bank to
provide strategic and well-targeted assistance. The series o f studies completed in
FY06, including the Labor Market Study, Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and
Financial Sector Review (FSR), assisted in identifying priority reform for supporting
growth and helped to design the Bank’s lending program. The Education Sector Review
and Public Expenditure Reviews (PER) for FY09 o n decentralized basic services
enhanced the Bank’s understanding o f key basic services sectors. The Doing Business
Reports have also provided valuable guidance in targeting World Bank support in
improving the investment climate. An internal political economy analysis (FY08) and
the upcoming Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) have guided the Bank’s decisions
on the direction o f the future CAS.
8.
Notwithstanding this, Bank support could have benefited from greater
selectivity and inter-sectoral coordination. In attempting to cover all o f the outcomes
under each o f the four pillars to which the CAS aligned support, the country program
spread Bank support widely across sectors and geographic regions. The extended scope
and size o f the program proved cumbersome to implement and resulted in more dispersed
and weaker impact and visibility than anticipated. Apart from greater selectivity, the
program would have benefited from greater coordination between individual projects and
sectors. The interrelated nature o f many o f the CAS outcomes called for a more cohesive
approach through which the synergies and complementarities o f the various interventions
could have been more fully exploited to maximize the efficient use o f Bank resources.
The sequencing and balance between general budget support and investment
lending could also have been fine-tuned. While general budget support proved suitable
for macro reforms, it had less impact in influencing sectoral reforms and institutional
strengthening. In terms o f sequencing, capacity-building technical assistance projects

60

that were intended to run parallel to budget support initiatives were often hamstrung by
unpredictability and delays in specific budgetary allocations. This was demonstrated in
the Decentralized Urban Capacity Building Project (DUCB) which was impeded by
delayed budget investment transfers to local governments.

9.
CAS implementation had a moderate impact on the client’s institutional
development. Support to a multi-faceted reform agenda, improved public financial
management and the decentralization process was coupled with targeted institutional
strengthening and capacity-building initiatives across a broad spectrum o f stakeholders,
including central government agencies, departments, decentralized agencies, community
structures and the private sector. However, institutional and human capacity remains
exceptionally weak and requires intensified support. Future plans to improve and utilize
country financial management and procurement systems would enhance the impact o f
Bank interventions on Burkina Faso’s institutional development.

10.
Sustainability: With a central Government that i s committed and leading visible
and meaningful reforms, the effects o f many o f the Bank’s interventions during the CAS
period are likely to be sustained over time. The country’s strong ownership o f the
program considerably reduces the risks o f reversal or change in direction. In addition,
donor commitments remain strong which augurs well for sustained inflows o f external
assistance. For example, investment climate reforms under the Doing Business program
are helping to lay some o f the foundations for growth and private sector involvement.
The urban water project focused on strengthening the institutional capacity and
management o f the nation’s water utility and the Community-Based Rural Development
Project (CBRDII) supported the establishment o f communal structures for ongoing local
participation. O f concern, however, i s the drop in the IEG’s outcomes and sustainability
ratings o f the portfolio over the last three years. An action plan to intensify portfolio
management i s currently being implemented to address this issue.
Supporting accelerated and shared growth (pillar 1)

Growth and poverty reduction:
Despite severe exogenous shocks in the last few years, the country was able to
11.
maintain macroeconomic stability. Due to a series o f external shocks which caused a
fall in cotton and agricultural production and exports and high food and energy prices,
economic growth slowed from 5.5 percent in 2006 to 3.6 percent in 2007 and inflation
rose from 2.4 percent in 2006 to 7.7 percent in April 2008 and 9.5 percent for 2008.
However, economic recovery due to a good harvest in 2008 saw GDP growth rise to 5
percent. Although Burkina Faso’s development endeavors were adversely affected by the
series o f shocks over the period, the Government managed to maintain a relatively stable
macroeconomic environment - a result o f i t s solid fiscal discipline, sound policy
implementation and inflows o f external aid. The unfolding negative impact o f the global
financial crisis on Burkina Faso poses a significant threat to the country’s continued
macro-economic stability.

61

’

12.
The poverty headcount i s estimated to have decreased from 46.3 percent in
2003 to 42.1 percent in 2006, however a notable increase in the incidence o f poverty
between 2007 and 2008 has reversed the progress made over the previous four
years. Decelerated economic growth, energy and food price increases and a drop in
agricultural productivity in 2007 and 2008 raised the share o f the population living below
the poverty line to 45 percent.

13.
The Bank’s strategy to support Burkina in accelerating shared growth targeted i)
increasing regional integration; ii) expanding and diversifying export earnings; iii)
improving the investment climate and; iv) developing more efficient economic
infrastructure. The CAS achieved sound progress in supporting this pillar’s objective,
with achievements in meeting most o f the outcomes for the pillar. As a result o f the
cotton crisis in 2007, the Bank placed particular emphasis on supporting the cotton
sector. Consequently, support to diversification o f the economy outside o f the cotton
sector has been slow to commence.
Expanding and diversifyin? export earning:
14.
The Government’s initiation o f higher yield Bt cotton seeds use, better storage
facilities, advanced agricultural techniques, recapitalization plans for cotton companies
and better-aligned producer price setting mechanisms enabled the country to withstand
the cotton crisis in 2007. A rebound to pre-crisis levels in cotton output was projected for
2008. However the global financial crisis and falling cotton prices are expected to exert
significant pressure on the sector in the near to medium t e r m and further efforts to
address structural weaknesses and the lack o f competitiveness in the sector will be
needed.
15.
The CAS identified a role for IDA in strengthening and liberalizing the
cotton sector and increasing cotton yields. At the height o f the 2007 cotton crisis
(which involved a 44 percent drop in cotton production, 14 percent slump in producer
prices, reductions in farmer revenues and increased indebtedness o f cotton farmer
cooperatives), and in response to Government requests, IDA’S response was escalated.
Through the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series, support was given to
short-term recapitalization o f one o f the cotton companies, the implementation o f new
producer price mechanisms, technical and financial support to the re-privatization
process, and support measures to consolidate the cotton sector beyond the crisis. The
Agriculture DiversiJication & Market Development Project (ADMDP) also supported
increased productivity and farming system diversification initiatives. The upcoming
C E M will suggest mechanisms to mitigate climatic, commodity price and exchange rate
risks. Given the external climate and the significant vulnerability o f the cotton sector,
sustained efforts to support ongoing reforms and to stabilize performance will be crucial
to the viability o f this sector.
16.
Progress towards economic diversification has been slow. The PRSP
identified economic diversification as paramount to alleviating the over-reliance on the
cotton sector and to expanding export earnings. The Government has focused on the

62

promotion o f mining, improved agricultural productivity enhancing technologies and
irrigated agriculture. Despite government efforts (including the formulation o f a rural
development strategy on crop production diversification; the adoption o f standards for
oilseed products and a law on seed and technology transfer; and restructuration o f the
Ministry o f Agriculture, Water and Fisheries), exports have stagnated at 9 percent o f
GDP over the last decade, with the share o f cotton exports rising from 48 percent to over
60 percent in some years. To achieve diversification, the Government faces the
significant challenge o f addressing a multitude o f interrelated constraints including poor
infrastructure, the high cost public services and utilities and inadequate policies and
institutional frameworks for private investment and export promotion. Given this and the
recent focus on cotton, the diversification process i s likely to take time.

17.
The Bank’s AAA support was instrumental in assisting the Government to
identify areas for diversification. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS)
suggested several measures to improve prospects for export diversification beyond cotton
to products such as cattle and meat, sesame, gold, zinc, mangoes and craft products. The
C E M will provide further guidance. Budget support under PRSC7 was in part directed
towards the adoption and implementation o f an export promotion strategy. However, the
impetus o f these initiatives has been dampened by delays in the adoption and
implementation o f a national export strategy.
18.
IDA’S support in the agriculture sector has targeted the development o f key
market-driven agricultural supply chains.
The ADMDP supported farming
cooperatives, expanded irrigation, improvements to productive and marketing
infrastructure and improvements to the private investment regulatory and legal
framework. The progress o f the project was hampered by an overly ambitious project
design and by complications in establishing an implementation structure. However, an
intermediate plan o f action enabled the project to conclude key supply chain studies and
to finance supply chain and irrigation m i c r o - p r ~ j e c t sand
~ ~ the project i s now achieving
good progress towards i t s development objectives. The studies and experiences o f the
ADMDP will underpin and guide Bank support to the diversification process in the
upcoming CAS.
The Bank adjusted its program to support the emerging export potential in
19.
gold mining. Due to the liberalization o f the sector in 1996 and support from the World
Bank-funded Mining Sector Capacity Building and Environmental Management Project
(1998-2004), gold mining has emerged as a promising export in Burkina Faso. Mining
production reached 5.2 tons in 2008 and i s projected to grow by a further 8 tons by 2009.
World Bank support during the CAS period has been directed towards assisting the
Government to manage the influx o f private sector investments. In response to
Government requests in 2008, the CEDP project was restructured to enhance institutional
capacity and monitoring capacities within the Ministry o f Mines. Through budget
support, IDA i s providing technical assistance on Burkina Faso’s involvement in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),
46 These micro-projects have assisted in the development of market activities for onions, mangoes and
meat, resulting in an export contracts which exceeded 50 OOOt in FY08.

Improving the investment climate:
Burkina Faso was ranked as one o f the top ten Doing Business performers in
20.
2009 f o r its business regulatory reforms, which formed part of a series o f reforms
introduced by the Government to improve the investment climate. Through these
reforms the Government has improved contract enforcement, established two Business
Registration Centers (CEFORE), reformed construction permit processes and reduced
business registration formalities. The effects o f these extensive reforms are reflected in
the consistent improvements to Burkina Faso’s ranking in the Doing Business
indicators4’. In energy, an important country outcome was to improve the legal and
regulatory framework to encourage private sector and donor participation in the sector.
The adoption o f the Electricity L a w in November 2007 i s a key result o n the institutional
front. With respect to infrastructure, achievements included the adoption o f the
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) promotion policy and sectoral
strategy.
The Government made significant progress in land reform, with the
development o f a National Policy for Rural Land Tenure which is expected to be passed
by the National Assembly in early 2009. However, structural reforms to the electricity
utility, SONABEL, as well as to parts o f SONABHY have lagged due to changing
government plans for the liberalization o f the sectors. A key future challenge will also be
to ensure the rapid implementation o f rural land reforms.
IDA’S early analytic work program brought investment climate constraints
21.
to the top o f the policy agenda4*. The Bank and IFC lending programs supported
government progress in improving the investment climate. Budget support was
directed towards labor market /regulatory framework reforms as well as reforms to
enhance security o f land tenure and provide infrastructure at lower cost (reforms in
electricity and petroleum). The IFC’s Doing Business program was instrumental in
supporting reforms to simplify and reduce the cost o f investment. The IDA-financed
CEDP further supported the Government in privatization and utility reform. State
divestiture o f at least 15 o f the 21 enterprises slated for privatization was achieved,
including the privatization o f the telecommunications company, ONATEL (increasing
teledensity three times above target). The CEDP also provided technical assistance to
promote the development o f a strong and competitive private sector. Under the project,
the Maison de 1’Entreprise du Burkina Faso (MEBF) was established as a private sectorled structure to strengthen private sector capacity and improve business processes
through the provision o f information, advocacy services and targeted business
In support o f
development services to over 4,500 private sector personnel.
diversification, the MEBF recently opened an office dedicated to assisting exporting
enterprises and is working with the A D M D P in this regard. Regional projects in the
banking and finance sector have improved financial transfer systems and strengthened
capital markets.

47
48

Burkina’s Doing Business ranking improved b om 161 in 2008 to 148 in 2009.
Studies included the ICA, FSR, Labor Market Study and DTIS.

64

22.
Improving the investment climate and developing the financial system
remain top priorities. In i t s latest Annual Progress Report, the Government heightened
the importance of improving the investment climate. Development o f the private and
finance sector, including implementation o f an investment promotion strategy and access
to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are crucial to growth and
diversification.
Efficient economic infrastructure:
The Government has made some progress in developing efficient economic
23.
infrastructure to reduce factor costs and stimulate private sector investment. In
transport, the Government has also played a lead role in coordinating donor activity.
Although a Road Fund has been established to ensure regular rehabilitation and
maintenance o f the road network concerted government efforts to ensure adequate
funding o f the Fund and to minimize inefficiencies in operation remain critical.

24.
Policy dialogue in the energy, telecommunications and petroleum sectors has
promoted reforms to enhance infrastructure efficiency. The Bank’s investment
lending has also directly enhanced transport and energy infrastructure. As part o f a
consortium o f donors assisting the Government in rehabilitating and maintaining essential
transport infrastructure, IDA financed the maintenance and rehabilitation o f 11O O k m o f
roads and supported institutional capacity building and structural reform in supporting the
development o f the Road Fund under the Transport Sector Project (TSP). As a donor o f
last resort, the Bank funded tertiary and secondary roads with low economic rates o f
return, but high social impact. The sustainability o f the Bank’s initiatives will depend
largely upon government efforts to ensure adequate financing o f the Road Fund. In
energy, IDA collaborated with four other partners to support both the immediate power
needs o f the country and longer-term economical energy measures under the Power
Sector Development Project (PSDP). The project co-financed the construction o f an
18MW power plant in 2006 and a regional interconnection transmission line from C8te
d’Ivoire to Ouagadougou due for completion in late 2009. Co-financing for an
interconnection with Ghana i s forecast for FY 10/11. In telecommunications, the CEDP
project i s supporting the strengthening o f capacity o f the telecom regulatory body,
ARTEL.
25.
Although the CAS indicated support for the development o f economic and market
infrastructure in secondary urban areas, the subsequently designed DUCB funded
technical assistance only and relied upon budget support for investment financing.
Budgetary allocations for these infrastructure investments have only recently been
committed and it i s therefore too early to assess progress.
Regional Integration
As a landlocked country, Burkina Faso has recognized its long-term
26.
economic interest in pursuing regional integration. It serves as a host country for the
headquarters o f W A E M U and President CompaorC held the rotating Presidency o f this

65

major sub-regional union in 2007. The Government has taken significant steps to achieve
greater regional integration in several sectors, including energy and transport.

27.

The CAS supported regional integration through measures aimed at
improving trade with the sub-region. Through the PRSCs and investment projects,
IDA continues to support Burkina in reaching WAEMU macroeconomic convergence
criteria and harmonizing trade and economic policies within the common West African
framework. Regional banking projects have supported the B C E A O regional payment
system and strengthened regional capital markets.

28.
In partnership with other donors, IDA has supported the development o f the West
Africa Power Pool (WAPP) which will integrate national power systems into a unified
regional electricity market. The IDNAFD financed extension o f the electricity
interconnection with C6te d’Ivoire from Bobo-Dioblasso to Ouagadougou under the
PSDP i s expected to halve the cost o f electricity. Following extensive delays, the
connection will be completed in 2009.
Also relevant to the outcome o f regional integration are the Bank-financed
29.
regional projects in transportation and the environment. The Bank’s support to the
development o f the Tema-Ouagadougou-Bamako transit corridor under the recently
commenced West Afiica Transport and Transit facilitation project (WATTFP) aims to
facilitate more efficient traffic flows and improve Burkina Faso’s access to Ghanaian
ports. The West and Central Afiica Air Safety and Security Project (WCAASSP) aimed
to assist Burkina Faso to improve air transport safety and security thereby increasing
access to regional and international markets. Performance o f the project has not been
smooth or speedy and has suffered in large measure from weak government commitment.
Regional cooperation to develop strategies for preventing and mitigating locust
infestations through the Afiica Emergency Locust Project (AELP) project has improved
the early warning and response strategies o f Burkina Faso and i t s neighbors.
Supporting improved access to basic social services and social protection (pillar 2)

30.
Although Burkina Faso continues to rank poorly in the UNDP Human
Development Index, it has made consistent progress49. The CAS period has been
marked by positive trends in the social welfare indicators, notably in improved access to
basic services, regular increases in budgetary allocations and expenditures and better
sector budget management. However, progress has been hampered by institutional
weaknesses and capacity constraints in the line ministries and issues related to the quality
o f basic services persist.
3 1.

Administrative de-concentration and political decentralization continue to
pose the greatest challenges to progress in this pillar. The framework for deconcentration and decentralization lacks clarity and the decentralization o f basic services

49 Since 1980, Burkina’s HDI value has risen &om 0.259 to 0.372, with a relatively high positive change
ratio o f 0.055 over the period 2000-2006

66

has taken longer than expected to materialize. While limited transfer o f competencies to
communes has been effected, resource transfers are only just commencing. Creating
incentives to motivate education and health professionals to move to rural areas through
the decentralization process represents a particularly challenging issue.
32.
Sound progress has been achieved in reaching the CAS human development
outcomes. The CAS supported Burkina’s human development goals by targeting access
basic education, (ii)
health, nutrition and HIV/AIDS prevention and care
to the poor to (i)
services, (iii)
potable water and sanitation services, and (iv) more extensive social safety
nets. The reialignment in lending approach towards harmonized, multi-donor delivery
mechanisms improved donor alignment with sectoral and sub-sectoral strategies, however
implementation difficulties related to inadequate adherence to country systems and weak
communication amongst donors limited the effectiveness o f these approaches. Although
the CASPR identified support to the decentralization process as a high priority, the
program could have better-targeted support for decentralization in individual social
service line ministries. Importantly, in FY09, sectoral budget support through the
Education for All Fast-Track Initiative will assist the Education ministry in implementing
the decentralization agenda in the education sector. Given that decentralization i s now in
i t s operational phase, in the upcoming CAS, greater focus on building the capacity o f the
local communes to manage their new responsibilities in social services will be critical.
Education:

33.

Significant progress has been achieved by the Government in improving
access to education, although issues relating to quality o f education and disparities
in coverage continue to exist at all levels. The benchmark indicator for increasing
national gross enrollment rate in primary education to 70 percent in 2009 has been
reached, however important disparities s t i l l exist between urban and rural zones. Though
the country continues to have one o f the lowest GER in post-primary in Africa, the GER
in lower secondary education increased from 20 percent in 2006 to 28.4 percent in 2008,
exceeding the target for 2008. Regular increases in education expenditures as a share o f
the GDP from 2.6 percent to 2.9 percent between 2004 and 2007 have allowed the
Government to expand teacher training and upgrade schools with running water and
sanitation facilities. The quality o f education services represents an ongoing stumbling
block and i s reflected in the l o w literacy rates (28.3 percent), teacher absenteeism, poor
student to teacher ratios and the l o w level o f teaching hours. Teaching hours averaged
640 hourdyear in 2007 compared to the national requirement o f 900 hours.

34.
I n primary education, the Government coordinated a harmonized sub-sector
approach through the Ten Year Plan for the Development of Basic Education
(PDDEB). The Bank supported these efforts by restructuring i t s existing basic education
program at mid-term and directing i t s lending towards a harmonized multi-donor pooled
PDDEB fund. The program has achieved sound results to date. Both GER and GIR
indicators surpassed end-of-project targets. The number o f public school teachers also
significantly increased, reaching 24,277 in 2007 (well beyond the 23,500 target set for
2009) and in-service training programs have had a positive impact on learning outcomes.

67

The completion rate for primary education rose from 33.5 percent to 41.1 percent in
2007.

While the sub-sector wide approach has helped to align donor support behind a
35.
unified sub-sector strategy, significant implementation difficulties arose due to noncompliance with Bank procurement rules and misunderstandings amongst donors as to
the Bank’s fiduciary obligations. The program revealed the need to strengthen country
financial management and procurement systems as a precondition for future integration
o f Bank programs into country systems. Burkina Faso i s now a pilot for use o f country
financial management systems and i s being considered for inclusion as a pilot for use o f
country procurement systems. The new Fast Track Initiative operation under the Bank’s
supervision, which will be in the form o f a Development Policy Operation, aims to
further strengthen national fiduciary systems. The Bank’s experience under the education
program also demonstrated the importance o f improving dialogue with donors to arrive at
common understandings with respect to donor expectations and internal constraints to
harmonization.
36.
I n secondary education the innovative public private partnership model was
replicated during the CAS period as part of the IDA co-financed Post Primary
Education Project 2 (PPEPII). The project i s on a satisfactory course to achieve i t s
objectives in all components, including the reduction in school fees, the de-concentration
o f procurement management to regional levels and reforms in pre-service teacher
training. PPEPII has also supported tertiary education reforms and vocational training.
The recently established International Institute for Water and Environmental
Engineering Project (2IE) aims to target skills generation by increasing the number o f
highly skilled professionals in the areas o f water, energy, environment and infrastructure
engineering.
Government efforts to integrate primary and secondary education and
37.
increase efficiency in educational spending have resulted in the adoption o f a
consolidated medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the sector as a
whole. The Bank’s PRSC series contributed towards the finalization o f the MTEF. The
recent Education Sector Review has assisted the Government in readjusting the national
program towards the development o f the education sector as a whole. Additional
financing under the PDEBB project in FY09 will support implementation o f the sector
review. Through the Education for All Fast Track Initiative, the Bank will engage
comprehensively in education policy dialogue.

Health:

38.
Health services have become more accessible. Positive trends in the health
sector include improvements in vaccination coverage, reduced mortality rates from
meningitis from 21 percent to 8.5 percent between 2005 and 2006, reduction in
HIV/AIDS mother to child transmission rates and a significant rise in the treatment o f
people living with HIV/AIDS (beyond CAS and Government targets). During the CAS
period, the Government introduced subsidies for obstetrical emergency care;

68

implemented a vaccination program (PEV) and a distribution system for essential drugs;
constructed health facilities; recruited 1,039 health staff and began the implementation o f
treatment policies, guidelines and protocols for HIV/AIDs which conform with those o f
the region. Importantly, the Ministry o f Health’s approach in contracting out the
implementation o f community-based health and nutrition interventions to civil society
organizations has rapidly scaled up essential health and nutrition activities at community
levels. The Government has responded quickly to meningitis out-breaks and a
malnutrition crisis through the establishment o f the Technical Committee for the
Management o f Epidemics and the National Council for Nutrition Coordination.
39.
Worrisome indicators despite improving trends include insufficient coverage with
regard to geographical access, staff and equipment and the persistent high rates o f
unassisted deliveries and acute malnutrition.
The Bank contributed to a constructive health policy dialogue within the
40.
PRSCs over the CAS period. This included support towards the establishment o f an
MTEF for the sector, a system o f obstetrical emergency subsidies and policies to reduce
the cost o f assisted births.

41.
The Health Sector Support and HIVproject (HSSXWAP), which contributes to
a pooled fund with other donors, provided direct support to improving maternal
and child health services and advancing prevention and treatment o f malaria,
meningitis and other communicable diseases. Vaccination levels (pentavalent) in
children under 1 rose from 57 percent to 106.9 percent between 2005 and 2008.
Subsidized bed net distribution increased from 600 000 in 2008 to 1, 607,000 in early
2009. The project supported the decentralization process by channeling pooled funds to
the central level and directly to health districts and hospitals o n the basis o f measurable
indicators. While progress was achieved in reaching some o f the key indicators in the
CAS, several targets were not reached. This is due in part to inefficiencies in
implementation, particularly prolonged procurement processes. However it also reveals
inadequacies in data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems within the sector.
The program would significantly benefit from a stock-taking exercise in the form o f an
ESW.
42.
This basket fund is an innovative example o f improved aid effectiveness. Donors
have aligned behind a common framework and a unified M&E system. The program has
enabled financing through different levels o f administration, as well as through NGO’s
and the private sector, in the case o f ARV treatment. It has also enabled flexible support
o f annual work programs, including rapid response to epidemics. A significant
achievement during the period was the Bank’s rapid response to the meningitis epidemic
(see B o x 1). Notwithstanding the benefits, the transaction costs for the World Bank in
taking this approach have been high due to donor reliance o n the Bank’s broad-based
expertise and level o f country presence to carry out program oversight and review
functions.

69

Box 1 - A Rapid Response to the Meningitis Outbreak
Recurrent outbreaks o f meningitis have been reported over the last 20 years. The most
recent and most devastating outbreak occurred in 1996 and left over 25,000 dead across
the “Meningitis Belt” (from Senegal to Djibouti) and another 60,000 with severe
neurological consequences. Epidemics occur every year, with more severe epidemics
occurring every 8 to 12 years. 2008 was a particularly bad year for Burkina Faso, with
meningitis taking the lives o f nearly 8,400 people. When epidemics occur, health
systems and health service personnel are often mobilized for weeks leaving regular
patients to search or wait for care. Such situations are an indication o f the non
preparedness o f countries to deal with emergencies. In the early stages o f the 2008
epidemic, Burkina appealed to donors for a more concerted and robust response to the
crisis, the donor community led by the Bank and UNICEF responded quickly by allowing
the country to use i t s existing credit proceeds to purchase 2.5 million doses o f vaccines
through a direct financing with UNICEF to make sure that the availability and quality of
the vaccines were guaranteed. This crucial partnership prevented the deaths o f thousands
for people. After the crisis was contained, the Bank then proceeded to allocated an
additional US$5 M for the purchase o f additional vaccines to prevent shortages in the
event that another epidemic might occur.

43.
IDA financing supported marked improvements in the prevention and
treatment o f HIV/AIDS. The underperforming HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project
was superseded by the HSS/MAP pooled fund. Promising indicators include the
reduction in HIV/AIDS prevalence from 7.17 percent in 1997 to 1.9 percent in 2008 and
the substantial increase in persons receiving HIV tests (from 37,638 in 2003 to 209,000 in
2007). Importantly, the World Bank succeeded in joining other donors in a pooled
HIV/AIDs fund in 2008/9. IDA’S support o f the regional HIV/AIDS project has
contributed to the development o f pilot strategies for strengthening country capacity to
scale up comprehensive care and treatment programs.
Nutrition. Although the CAS envisaged a role for the Bank in combating child
malnutrition, Government coordination o f nutrition activities was initially slow to
commence. The Determinants o f Child Malnutrition study forecast in the 2006 CAS was
dropped. However, in the wake o f the food price crisis and in response to rising levels o f
malnutrition, nutrition became a primary concern and the Government escalated i t s
coordination efforts. In response, additional IDA financing o f $10 million was secured
for community-based health and nutrition activities which aim to reach a minimum o f 15
percent o f the total population o f rural children under five. Additional financing o f the
PDDEB also targets school feeding programs. N o w that malnutrition has come to the
fore o f the national agenda, the Bank will need to consider continued multi-sectoral
support.

Water and sanitation:
44.
Burkina Faso i s on track to meet the MDGs related to access to potable
water. The Government successfully coordinated a multi-donor partnership to boost

70

large scale urban infrastructure in Ouagadougou. Support o f village water management
and social water connection programs through the development o f public-private
partnerships (PPP) between communities and the local private sector has also yielded
results. Access to potable water has risen to 77 percent in urban areas and 54 percent in
rural areas. Through the National Water Supply and Sanitation Program (PN-AEPA), the
Government has developed a sectoral strategy which includes both urban and rural
dimensions. Notwithstanding progress in this sector, important disparities remain in
access to safe drinking water in rural communities. Improvements to sanitation have
included the development o f sanitation action plans in four 'cities. However these have
not been implemented and sanitation plans for other cities are s t i l l outstanding. The
Government has identified lack o f human resources as the main constraint to improving
the implementation o f sanitation programs.
I D A contributed to highly successful improvements to potable water access
45.
in Ouagadougou, under the $200 million multi-donor partnership coordinated by the
Government. The Ouagadougou Water Supply project (OWS), which closed in
December 2007, exceeded i t s objective by successfully ensuring continuity o f the water
service 24/7 and connecting 860,000 inhabitants to the water distribution network in the
capital city. Importantly, the project also strengthened the institutional development and
management capacity o f the national water utility, ONEA, resulting in increased bill
collection, improved productivity o f the commercial staff and alignment o f annual
financial reports with international standards. IDA will continue to support harmonized
initiatives under the national strategy through an urban water and sanitation project
planned for FY09. In rural areas, the Community-Based Rural Development Project 11
(CBRD-11) financed community-identified well and water purification projects.

46.
The PRSC series supported legislative amendments to enhance private sector
participation in water delivery in secondary urban and semi-rural areas. The
PRSCs also advanced a new water management framework and assisted with the
development o f sanitation strategic plans for secondary cities.
Social Protection Strategy
47.
I D A has supported the most vulnerable by targeting orphans and vulnerable
children (OVCs) through its education and health projects providing affordable
education, school feeding and school-based health care. The number o f OVCs
receiving reduced or free school fees doubled between 2005 and 2007. In the health
sector, the HSS/HIV project has contributed to improving OVC access to care and
support. In 2007, 30 percent o f OVCs received support. The World Bank's CBRD-I1
emergency seed distribution response in 2008 and additional funding to support nutrition
campaigns in communities and schools helped to minimize the impact o f food price
increases amongst vulnerable communities.
48.
Social protection and the development o f social safety nets will be important
issues in the upcoming CAS, due to the global economic downturn, the rising incidence

71

o f poverty and the heightened levels o f vulnerability to exogenous shocks. A review o f
social safety nets i s under preparation.
Supporting increased employment and income opportunities for the poor (pillar 3)

49.
The Government’s reform o f labor market policy has advanced the national
strategic objective o f improving employment opportunities. The Government has also
demonstrated a strong commitment to improving income opportunities for the rural poor
through community-based rural development and the adoption o f the National Policy on
Land Tenure Security in Rural Areas.

50.
Under the 2006 CAS, Bank support aimed to target: i)enhanced labor market
flexibility; ii) increased economic opportunities for women; iii)reduced risk and
increased revenues for rural households; iv) community-based land and natural resource
management and; v) expanded access to rural infrastructure. Progress has been achieved
in respect o f each o f these objectives. IDA’Scontribution towards rural development in
Burkina Faso, through the CBRD-11, has been particularly significant.

-

Box 2 Community Based Rural Development- a success story in Burkina Faso

The Bank’s Community Driven Development project in Burkina Faso i s widely
acclaimed as one o f the ‘success stories’ o f CAS implementation. Since the inception o f
the first phase, the project has continued to develop the capacity o f local communities to
plan, manage and implement their own development plans. In support o f the
decentralization process, the focus o f the project has extended to the development o f the
capacity o f rural communes nationwide. The support o f these structures has enabled the
efficient and rapid implementation o f local development plans and projects. A
noteworthy example involved the targeted distribution o f seed to rural farmers during the
peak o f the food price crisis in 2008. 3,500 tons o f improved millet, sorghum, maize,
beans and rice seeds were distributed to 140,000 households in 302 communities in the
country for a total o f $5 million. The targeting o f households was carried out by the
village councils, taking into account the level o f poverty and the impact o f flooding.
Enhance labor market flexibility for job creation

51.
Burkina Faso has recently stepped up initiatives to improve labor market
flexibility through several decrees in 2007 which regulated overtime, dismissals and
working hours. As a consequence, the Doing Business Labor Market Rigidity Index
rating for Burkina has fallen from a last-place standing o f 90 to 61 in 2008 (although this
i s s t i l l well above the regional average o f 42.6 and the CAS 2009 target o f 50). A new
labor code approving these changes was enacted in 2008.
The Bank’s AAA support was instrumental in generating dialogue on labor
52.
market liberalization. The Labor Market Study, the ICA, the Regional ECOWAS
Financial Market Review and the DTIS assisted the Government in identifying key
logjams to labor market flexibility and guided the national reform agenda. IDA financed
projects have also directly contributed to job creation. For example, job creation

72

initiatives in SME credit line supported the creation o f 1486 new jobs under the CEDP
project.
Enhanced Economic Opportunities for Women.

53.
Government progress on girls and women’s opportunities included the
revision o f the national employment strategy, translation o f women’s rights into local
languages and improved women’s literacy in rural areas. A national policy for the
promotion o f women was adopted and disseminated in 2000 and the national gender
policy was adopted in 2009.
54.
Many World Bank operations have had positive benefits for women and
girls, especially in the education, private, agriculture and health sectors. Gross
primary school enrollment reached 64.84 percent in 2008 and secondary enrollment
reached 23.5 percent for girls. In the agricultural sector, support was given to women’s
associations for production, marketing and processing, as well as access to technology
geared to women’s income-generating activities. Under the ADMDP, o f the 992 microprojects approved by the selection committees in March 2008, 540 micro-projects were
managed by women’s groups, or individual women. CBRD-I1 supports the empowerment
o f gender-balanced village committees to define and implement local development
projects, as well as literacy programs targeted at rural women. The project has also
contributed to increasing women’s awareness o f their rights
55.
Notwithstanding recommendations in the CASPR, Bank projects have not
successfully and systematically integrated gender into their monitoring and evaluation
frameworks. Given the central importance o f empowering women as a mechanism for
addressing the population growth dilemma in Burkina, further efforts to mainstream and
track progress on gender are called for under the new CAS.
Reduced risk and increased revenues for rural households
56.
Government efforts to support income-generating activities and employment
opportunities in rural areas have included the implementation o f the small irrigation
development program under the National Policy for Sustainable Development o f Irrigated
Agriculture, improved management o f cereal food stocks and the adoption o f the rural
land tenure policy. However, the vulnerability o f rural communities calls for
strengthened Government support to social protection mechanisms. Implementation of
the rural land reforms also remains critical.
57.
IDA’S investment lending has supported revenue growth in rural areas. The
micro-projects financed under the ADMP promoted contractual arrangements among
supply chain operators to ensure that farmers receive a share o f the value added to the
supply chains. The project also strengthened the capacity o f producers to address key
constraints at their level and engage in fair and balanced partnerships with other
stakeholders. It yielded results in small-scale private irrigation production, increasing the
income o f farmers under the micro-projects by more than 30 percent. As identified by
the ICR, under the Partnership for Natural Ecosystem Management Project (PAGEN),

73

the involvement o f local communities in activities related to the management o f protected
areas (e.g. surveillance, reforestation, tourism) and the support to natural resource-based
income generating activities (e.g. apiculture, aulacodiculture) resulted in a marginal
increase in income among peripheral communities. The first C B R D project, which ended
during the 2006 CAS period, financed 18,250 local community micro-projects selected
by elected Village Committees, thereby increasing rural household revenue and reducing
vulnerability in the effected communities. The CBRD-I1 project is s t i l l in the preparatory
stages o f implementation, however through financing o f community and commune
development plans from FY09, the project will reinforce earlier initiatives to increase the
productive capacity o f the rural sector. The CBRD-I1 also provided support to the
Government’s land tenure reform.

58.
The Bank also supported risk management initiatives in order to stabilize
and improve the livelihoods o f rural communities. These included the rapid
development o f a regional early warning and response system for locust infestation and
gradual improvements to land and water preservation and biodiversity through the
PAGEN and Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management (SILEM) projects.
Community-based land and natural resource management

59.

The Government’s scaling-up o f community driven development
mechanisms has achieved positive results in community-based land and natural
resource management. IDA took the lead in financing government community
development initiatives under the CBRD project. The first phase o f the project, which
ended mid-way through the CAS period, was highly successful. The project assisted
local communities to implement and manage their own development plans. The second
phase o f the project has been re-oriented to align better with the newly created
decentralized administrative structures. The project will continue to support community
development plans from FY09 through rural communes and village development
committees (Conseil villageois de dkveloppement - CVD’s).

60.
Two projects were tailored to operate in connection with PNGT to enhance
Bank support o f community-based land and natural resource management. The
GEF financed P A G E N which ended in 2007 aimed to reverse biodiversity trends in
priority protected areas. The project introduced a successful community-based natural
resource management model and resulted in the adoption o f a community management o f
wildlife and natural resources strategy. The project revealed the importance o f educating
communities and o f linking ecomanagement with income generation to mobilize
community involvement. It also highlighted the importance o f long-term funding
commitments to properly achieve improvements in biodiversity and sustained community
involvement in protection activities. The S I L E M program has educated and empowered
local governments and rural communities in four provinces to develop and implement
sound environment and watershed management and conservation sub-proj ects.

74

Expanded access to rural infrastructure
The Government has introduced important initiatives to improve access to
61.
rural infrastructure over the CAS period. In energy, the Government introduced a
Rural Electrification Strategy and established the Electrification Development Fund to
promote, administer and supervise rural electrification projects. In transport, the
Government has committed to providing adequate funding for road maintenance. Rural
communities have also benefited from expanded access to telecommunication networks.

62.
IDA funding focused on improving access to rural infrastructure through
targeted transport and energy interventions. The recently commenced Burkina Faso
Rural Energy Access Project (REAP) aims to promote the use o f a spectrum o f
innovative service delivery mechanisms for improving rural electrification - through
grid-based rehabilitation and expansion and the installation o f external rural grids,
thermal stand-alone grids, solar-based systems and multifunctional platforms. Capacitybuilding for cooperative and private sector participation forms an integral part o f the
project. In transport, the IDA-financed TSP has facilitated improved access o f the poor
to rural infrastructure through the maintenance and rehabilitation o f secondary and
tertiary networks.

Supporting better governance with greater decentralization(pillar 4)

63.
Governance. Progress achieved by the Government in the area o f governance
the adoption and implementation o f the Action Plan on the National Good
included: (i)
the adoption and ongoing implementation o f an action plan
Governance Policy; (iii)
based on the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR); (iii)
the launching o f the
African Peer Review Mechanism (MAEP) whose objective i s to encourage mutual selfevaluation, monitoring and learning; and (iv) the adoption in May 2006 o f a national anticorruption policy. Importantly, in 2007, the Government committed to step up efforts to
improve governance and transparency with the establishment o f an independent audit
institution (ASCE).

PFM: The Government also made considerable progress in the context o f public
64.
resource management with the introduction o f a broader integrated action plan to
strengthen public finances in 2007 (SRFP), the introduction o f computerized expenditure
management systems in the regions; the preparation o f timely reports on budget
execution and adoption o f program budgets and MTEFs in key sector ministries.
65.
Decentralization: Progress has been slower than expected during the operational
phase o f the decentralization process. Following the Decentralization Law o f 2004,
elections for local governments (Collectivitds Territoriales - CT’s) were held in 2006. A
legal framework and administrative decrees were introduced and priority responsibilities
covering most primary service delivery functions (primary education, safe water supply,
basic health services etc.) were transferred to the newly elected. Despite these steps
forward, the transfer o f adequate funding and support has been slow and lacking in

75

clarity. CT’s continue to lack the means and resources to properly plan and implement
transferred mandates and activities. In implementing the decentralization policy, four
issues critical to improved service delivery and poverty reduction remain: (i)
adequate
resource transfers to the local level and rationalization o f administrative structures in light
o f the new institutional structure o f the state, (ii)
capacity development at the local level;
(iii)implementation o f modern management tools in the civil service and (iv)
strengthened local participation and monitoring.
An analysis o f the political economy in Burkina Faso in 2008 reveals that the
66.
country still faces significant governance challenges characterized by centralized
decision-making power, l o w incentives for reform amongst actors with the strongest
power and weak capacity on the demand-side.
The implementation o f this pillar of the CAS has had mixed results. The
67.
2006 CAS directed Bank support specifically towards the following outcomes: i)a more
efficient judiciary for commercial cases; ii)improved public resource management in a
decentralized context; and iii)increased local capacity and participation in public policy
decisions. Significant progress was achieved in the context o f public financial
management. However, the Bank’s approach to governance and anti-corruption (GAC)
over the CAS period was fragmented. With improved government ownership o f G A C
issues since 2007 and the country’s position as a CGAC pilot, a more strategic and crosssectoral approach to GAC, covering both demand and supply aspects, is warranted in the
upcoming CAS.

More efficient iudiciarv for commercial cases
The Bank’s involvement in judicial reform has been limited. The IDA
68.
financed CEDP project trained 120 magistrates in business law between 2003 and 2008,
exceeding original targets. Progress was also achieved in harmonizing Burkina’s
business laws in line with O H A D A standards and an arbitration and mediation centre
within the Chamber o f Commerce was established.

Improved public resource management in a decentralized context:
69.
The Bank’s support o f public resource management has facilitated Burkina’s
marked progress in this area. The PRSC series continues to be an effective instrument
in advancing the public financial management agenda, assisting procurement reform;
budget de-concentration, expenditure management and budget control. The 2005 CPAR
and 2007 Country FinancialProcurement Assessment (PEFA) reports were the key
assessments performed in recent years by the Bank. The Government has used the
findings o f these assessments to update the budget management reform program
(Programme de Reforme de l a Gestion Budgetaire). In terms o f P F M oversight, the
production o f annual reports by the ASCE is a particular achievement. The Public
Control Institutions Project funded by IDF has helped to reinforce the capacity o f control
institutions to improve public financial management oversight and reduce corruption.
Given that 68 percent o f audit reports in FY08 were considered not acceptable, further

76

strengthening o f the capacity o f both public sector control institutions and private audit
f i r m s i s warranted. A new I D F project will be developed this fiscal year to assist the
CPA Board and a private audit firm assessment will be carried out.
70.
Though important steps have been taken to improve the procurement and
financial management regulatory framework, procurement reviews have revealed
significant procurement and financial management capacity constraints. Burkina
Faso has been selected as a pilot country for initiatives to strengthen capacity and enable
further use o f country financial management systems. Burkina i s also being considered
for inclusion as a pilot for use o f national procurement systems. The Government has
indicated commitment to this process.

71.

As a key contributor to the decentralization strategy, the World Bank was
positioned as a lead supporter o f decentralization in Burkina Faso throughout the
CAS period, however financing has not, until recently, focused support on the
decentralized commune structures. The Bank’s support o f the decentralization process
has been multi-faceted. Budget support and specific investment instruments have
promoted policy dialogue. IDA financing has also supported strengthening the
institutional capacity o f central institutions and decentralized administrative structures
(provinces, communes and villages) to implement the decentralization process. Until
recently, however, the portfolio gave little direct support to the communes. An ESW on
Decentralization was carried out in FY07 to assess the state o f the decentralization
process. The findings o f that report have yet to be published however.
72.
Decentralization has featured as an important element in both PRSC series.
Under PRSC 6 the framework for the transfer o f resources and competencies to
communes was finalized. Subsequent credits were directed towards the implementation
o f the framework, however progress on this front has been slow and i s complicated by
resistance to the reform process. IEG acknowledged that the notwithstanding the slow
pace o f implementation, the early PRSC series were instrumental in accelerating progress
towards decentralization. The same can be said for the PRSC series under the 2006 CAS.
73.
The ACBP has strengthened central institutional capacity in the context o f the
decentralization process in four cross-cutting central ministries. The DUCB strengthened
the capacity o f the main urban municipalities to take on the responsibilities transferred to
them through the decentralization process with support to urban management capacity,
financial resource mobilization and financial management o f municipalities. The project
assisted in the Government’s creation o f a fund for investment transfers (Fonds
Permanent Pour L e DCveloppement des CollectivitCs Territoriales) in April 2007.

74.
In the rural context, the CBRD-I1 project builds upon the successes o f CBRD and
adapts to the emergence o f elected rural communes by channeling funding through and
supporting capacity building o f the communes. The project i s in the process o f financing
crucial capacity training in the 302 rural communes. Direct funding o f rural commune
and village development plans will commence later in FY09.

77

75.
Despite multi-faceted support to capacity development, the impact o f Bank
operations on addressing systemic institutional and capacity weaknesses has been
limited: In addition to capacity-building components in each o f the projects, IDA funded
the ACBP as an overarching capacity development program to support central ministries
responsible for implementing public sector reform. The project supports decentralization,
human resource management, public expenditure management and formulation,
management and evaluation o f public policies in the three cross-cutting central ministries
and the Prime Minister’s Office. The project has suffered from a lack o f government
ownership accompanied with a lack o f government spending in important areas such as
civil service performance management and transfer o f competencies in the
decentralization process. It i s being re-structured to improve the quality o f the indicators
and enhance implementation efficiency. Despite instances o f improvement, globally the
Bank’s initiatives have not resulted in core institutional capacity development. A WBIled retrospective will be carried out on capacity development initiatives in the Bank
program to strengthen the Bank’s strategic approach in the forthcoming CAS.
76.
The Development of the National Stutisticul System Project (STATCAP)
supported improvements to the central statistics agency through capacity-building,
development of a legal and institutional framework and enhanced statistical
infrastructure. Though the results o f the project are promising with the number o f
statisticians in training and the number o f workshops implemented reaching target,
statistical capacity remains low in Burkina Faso and represents a major constraint for
effective monitoring and evaluation in all sectors.
Increased local capacity and participation in local policy decision making
77.
World Bank support to this outcome has focused upon direct empowerment
o f citizens and local communities through the CBRD-I1 and DUCP. The CBRD-I1
supported hundreds o f villages in the participatory preparation o f their local development
plans. A Japanese Social Development Fund-financed project in FY09 w i l l introduce
participatory monitoring and evaluation mechanisms into the health and education
programs with a view to replicate the mechanism in other Bank projects.
78.
Contrary to indications in the 2006 CAS, the World Bank did not engage in
capacity-building o f civil society to any significant degree and the inclusion o f civil
society in public decision-making, whilst encouraged by the World Bank, did not receive
particular attention. CGAC consultations held in 2007 and a study on demand-side
governance in Burkina Faso have recommended increased Bank engagement with civil
society.

78

C. MeasuringBank Performance
a)

Portfolio Assessments

79.
During the CAS period, Burkina Faso implemented four poverty reduction
support credits under the second and third programmatic series (PRSC 5-8).
Implementation o f the CAS outcomes also involved 4 closed projects, 15 active projects
(including 5 regional), 7 new projects and 8 pipeline projects. IDA and GEF are the main
sources o f funding in the form o f either credits or loans. Annexes A and B compare the
planned and actual deliveries o f non-lending and lending support during the CAS period
under review.

80.
Globally, the assessment o f the portfolio i s satisfactory with over h a l f o f the
projects considered satisfactory. There are no unsatisfactory or problem projects in the
portfolio. There are, however, a number o f projects rated moderately satisfactory. In the
case o f moderately satisfactory projects, four key issues require attention: design
complexity; global implementation progress; project management and issues related to
The portfolio’s only past problem project, the
monitoring and evaluation.
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project, has been restructured.

81.
The Country Portfolio Performances Review (CPPR) conducted in October 2008
revealed that the portfolio i s performing well above AFR region averages, with good
results on the ground. However, the CPPR revealed widespread shortcomings in
monitoring and evaluation systems, including poorly aligneddesigned results
frameworks, a lack o f M&E expertise within projects and insufficiencies in statistical
delays in projects being made
data collection and analysis. The review also identified: (i)
effective; (ii)
slow procurement processes (related to Bank delays in non-objections, slow
mobilization o f the national counterpart and delays in signing contracts and cumbersome
slow disbursement and weak absorptive capacity o f credits; and (iv) a
procedures); (iii)
lack o f incentives for government officials responsible for implementing the projects.
The review recommended improvements to M&E systems, reducing complexity in
project design; enhancing synergies between sectors and restructuring projects with weak
performance to improve impact. An action plan has been developed and includes (i)
documentation o f good practice; (ii)
quarterly country team meetings o n portfolio issues;
(iii)
strengthened government ownership in project design; (iv) M&E support clinics; and
(v) support to country financial management and procurement systems.
82.
The disbursement ratio i s to some extent reasonable given that many projects
are in fact only just commencingimplementation and a few have received additional
financing. As o f the 28 January 2009, US$345.6 million o f the total gross commitment
o f US$530.38 million remains to be disbursed. The relatively weak disbursement ratio
takes into account new projects which have been approved but for which no
disbursements have been made. If these projects are excluded, the disbursement ratio for
the remainder o f the active projects is 5 1 percent. This can be explained if one takes into
account the delay in execution for many o f these projects (generally 5 years). Gaps in

79

project readiness contribute to effectiveness delays and slow project start up which
impedes implementation progress and, in turn, disbursement.
b)

Quality o f Products and Services

83.
Over the CAS period, the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated 3 projects
(Transport, Statcap and CEDP). The Transport and STATCAP projects were rated
moderately satisfactory on quality at entry. Quality o f supervision was rated satisfactory
for STATCAP and moderately satisfactory for the two other projects.
84.
IEG ratings o f Burkina Faso projects have improved over the last 5 years
(particularly in the context o f institutional development) and exceed the African Regional
average. O f concern, however, i s the drop in the outcomes and sustainability ratings over
the last three years. The country team is presently reviewing this aspect o f the portfolio.
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluated seven projects. For six o f them, IEG
rated the Bank and Borrower performances as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory and
the risk to development outcomes as moderate. While quality o f supervision was
considered adequate for two projects, the quality at entry was considered unsatisfactory
for one project and sufficient for the other. All ICRs reviewed were rated satisfactory,
with the exception o f the Community-Based Rural Development project which was
considered exemplary.
c)

Country Dialogue, Aid Coordination and Outreach Activities

85.
The country team has engaged in constructive dialogue with the Government
throughout the CAS period. Analytical work has supported dialogue o n development
priorities and, in the case o f fiduciary work, helped the design o f the reform program.
The PRSC series was the most effective instrument for sustained dialogue on policy
priorities and for assisting the Government to address the challenges o f macro reform
implementation.

The presence o f in-country / in-region TTL’s (5 TTLs and 1 co-TTL) improved
86.
response times, interactions with the client, monitoring o f projects and synergies between
projects. Specialists in Health, Agriculture, Energy, Private Sector, Finance and
Education also strengthened sectoral dialogue. The arrival o f a new Country Manager
has improved the coherence o f the Bank’s approach.
87.
Coordination with other donors has improved. Burkina Faso has been a donor
coordination pilot country since 2003. One o f the cornerstones o f the CAS was the
intended shift towards an increasingly programmatic approach. Progress has been made
especially in harmonizing approaches in education, health, HIV/AIDS and water supply.
However implementation difficulties remain. The establishment o f the joint Cadre
General d’organisation BudgCtaires (CGAB) has also resulted in deepening coordination
o f donors in the context o f budget support through alignment o f policy advice, a joint
performance matrix and annual progress reports. Initiatives have also been taken in other
sectors (transport and energy) to align support behind common frameworks, although

80

further progress i s needed. Through involvement in the Technical Secretariat for Aid
Effectiveness (STELA), the World Bank has been engaged with the donor community
and the Government in applying the recommendations o f the recent High Level Forum on
Aid Effectiveness in Accra. The World Bank i s also leading initiatives to develop o f
broad partnership o f donors with a view to creating a joint assistance strategy upon the
preparation o f the new PRSP.
88.
Results from the 2008 Survey on Monitoring Paris Declaration show that the
Bank has made substantial progress toward the Paris Declaration targets but more efforts
are needed to strengthen these achievements. The Bank i s on track to meeting the Paris
Declaration targets for use o f public financial; management (PFM) systems and has made
progress on increasing lending through Program-Based approaches (PBAs) as well as
conducting joint analytic work.
89.

The Bank’s experience in donor coordination during the CAS period has raised
three particular issues: (1) coordination relies upon effective national leadership; (2) the
implementation o f country systems requires significant strengthening to enable greater
integration o f Bank support; (3) programmatic approaches tend to involve high
transaction costs and depend upon the development o f common understandings amongst
donors with respect to fiduciary and monitoring and evaluation expectations.

90.
Client Survey. The results o f the client survey demonstrated that the overall
impression o f Bank performance amongst clients and stakeholders i s good (6/10). The
effectiveness o f the Bank in supporting poverty reduction was also rated highly (7/10).
Respondents listed financial resources and economic and policy advice as the two most
important aspects o f Bank support to Burkina Faso. 75 percent o f respondents considered
that the World Bank’s requirements for accessing finance should be simplified.
Engagement with private sector, civil society and outreach activities. The
91.
World Bank’s outreach activities have included public university lectures,
communication open-house sessions with journalists and sporadic consultations with civil
society. Civil society remains relatively poorly informed about the World Bank’s work
in Burkina Faso. A regular outreach program with civil society has been proposed as a
means o f improving information dissemination and dialogue. The JSDF-financed project
will also support local participatory monitoring o f Bank projects. During the preparation
and progress review o f the FY06 CAS, the Bank engaged in extensive consultations with
private sector, civil society and partners across three regions. The Bank also engaged a
broad spectrum o f stakeholders during the recent retreat in October 2008 which included
a portfolio review, an assessment o f performance under the FY06 CAS and brainstorming
on the direction o f the upcoming CAS.

D. I F C and M I G A
92.
IFC. IFC’s strategy for Burkina Faso focused on (i)
improving the investment
climate through the Doing Business Better Program; (ii)
capacity-building for mediumsize-enterprises and support to financial institutions to allow them to cater to the SME

81

segment;, (iii)
providing direct technical support to medium-size enterprises operating in
sectors that have positive externalities on other related sectors (e.g. agriculture,
construction, transport); and, (iv) proactive support for project development in the
financial, hospitality, infrastructure and mining sectors. In agriculture, IFC and the
World Bank worked with the Millennium Challenge Account to develop a program to
increase agricultural productivity by using local banks to support farmers. In transport,
the IFC and the World Bank engaged in dialogue with the Government on the new
airport. IFC sponsored a study to review the Government’s new airport proposal and
public private partnership options.
93.
Specific investments included a US$6 million credit line and TA funding o f
US$141,000 to support the establishment o f new micro-finance subsidiary o f BACB; a
Euro 7.5 million loan to Onatel S.A., to allow the telecom operator expand i t s activities;
and a US$5 million trade finance line to Ecobank Burkina as part o f an investment
package with, Ecobank Transnational Inc.
94.
MIGA. MIGA’s portfolio in Burkina Faso consists o f 1 project, in support o f the
country’s tourism sector, with a gross exposure o f US$3.3 million. The Agency issued
guarantees (against the risks o f transfer restriction, expropriation and war and civil
disturbance) to a Malian investor for i t s equity investment and loan guarantee toward a
hotel renovation and expansion. The project aims to support the country’s efforts to
create local
establish i t s e l f as a regional center for business tourism. It i s expected to: (i)
jobs; (ii)transfer knowledge; (iii)support the growth o f small and medium-size
businesses; and (iv) generate an increase in taxes and foreign exchange for the
Government. This investment i s also a joint collaboration between IFC and MIGA.
During FY09, MIGA i s working with Canadian investors to provide guarantees for their
investment in a gold mining project in Burkina Faso.

95.
WBI: Burkina Faso continues to be an active participant in W B I programs,
particularly in the area o f sustainable land management and natural capital, as well as
education. Several participants from Burkina Faso also attended W B I Regional events
thereby learning from and sharing development experiences with others in the Region.
There are no specific country-level programs currently planned for FY09, however it i s
expected that a number o f regional events will attract participation from Burkina Faso.
Burkina Faso i s a pilot country for the development of a joint World Bank
96.
Group CAS (World Bank, IFC and MIGA) in 2009.

E. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
The following lessons can be learned from the 2006 CAS:
1. Given that the CAS aligned support across every pillar o f the PRSP, the country
program would have benefited from greater selectivity to enhance impact and
visibility o f bank interventions. The CAS did not achieve i t s stated objective o f

82

’ ‘

simplifying the country program, indeed the number o f active-country-based
operations increased.

2. To maximize the efficient use o f Bank resources, a stronger focus on inter-sectoral
coordination at the country level i s warranted. Closer cooperation between sectoral
teams to harness the complementarities and synergies between sectors and projects
would have improved the country program’s coherence and better reflected the
interrelated and mutually reinforcing nature o f the PRSP objectives to which the CAS
aligned.

3. While budget support proved effective in advancing dialogue at the macro level,
it proved less effective in the context o f sectoral reforms. Consistent progress was
made in areas under the direct control o f the central ministries, notably the Ministry
o f Finance, whereas progress was uneven where reform implementation depended
upon the capacity and involvement o f particular line ministries. The PRSC series,
which covered a multitude o f different reforms across the budget, could have
benefited from targeting key reforms at the macro level.

4. While in theory, parallel TA projects are an effective complement t o budget support,
in practice they have limited impact where budgetary allocations are not forthcoming
for the particular activity to which the TA i s tied or where the sequencing o f
budgetary allocations and supporting TA is poorly timed.
5. Government ownership is vital to the effectiveness o f interventions. A stark
contrast can be drawn between interventions which lacked ownership, such as the
aviation safety project and those which were supported by political willingness such
as in the Doing Business program and the urban water project.

6. Donor harmonization and coordination. Budget support through the PRSC series
significantly improved donor coordination. Programmatic approaches in basic
services were successful insofar as they aligned donor support behind national
sectoral policies. However significant weaknesses in the implementation o f country
systems continue to represent a major obstacle. Future integration o f the Bank
projects and programs through use o f country systems will require marked
improvements to country financial management and procurement systems. The Bank
is in a strong position t o promote donor dialogue and alignment in the context o f
budget support and through sectoral working groups.

7. Successful diversification depends on overcoming a multitude o f obstacles
(infrastructure, private sector development, transport, export policies etc) and requires
the adoption o f a tightly integrated approach. Experience under the C A S shows that
it will take time to achieve diversification.

8. The development challenges posed by Burkina Faso’s rapid and uncontrolled
population growth need to be better understood and addressed by the Government
and the World Bank.

83

9. Burkina Faso’s decentralization process holds the key to improving access to and
quality o f basic services. Adequate financial autonomy and strong institutional
capacity are crucial to the proper functioning o f decentralized structures. In this
context, direct support to communes needs to be enhanced.

10. The successful CDD approach has demonstrated that empowered communities are
capable o f managing and monitoring their own development. Community-driven
development initiatives led by the Bank during the CAS period represent a key Bank
achievement worthy o f future replication.
11. Institutional capacity continues to be a major stumbling block to aid
effectiveness and development. The Bank needs to identify better targeted and more
extensive interventions geared towards longer t e r m strategic capacity development
objectives.
12. Tackling governance issues requires a more consistent and comprehensive
program-wide approach which targets both supply and demand sides. Though
the mandate o f the World Bank restricts the potential scope o f interventions, the
prevailing political momentum on G A C issues should be harnessed.

Appendix C: The Unfolding Crisis in the Cotton Sector

The cotton sector i s in the midst o f another crisis. The sector, which has not fully recovered
from the last crisis in 2004 -2006 that led to the recapitalization o f SOFITEX in 2007 and Faso
Coton as well as SOCOMA in 2008, now faces impending bankruptcy in the cotton companies,
heavily indebted farmer and village cooperatives who are unable to make profitable activity from
cotton (unless key financial parameters such as farm gate price, price o f fertilizers, indebtedness
and status, improve soon) and low productivity which risks diminishing further if producers
withdraw from the sector.
Cotton companies are expecting significant losses this campaign due to the drop o f cotton
prices on world markets and will likely be forced to recapitalize by October 2009 to avoid
bankruptcy. After being recapitalized in 2007, SOFITEX and Faso Coton have again
accumulated significant losses during the 2008/2009 cropping campaign amounting to over 50
percent o f their capital. International bids in early April 2009 were between CFAFSOO and
CFAF5 lO/kg o f fibber cotton, significantly below the break-even point for cotton companies,
estimated at between CFAF680 to CFAF73Okg. Due to the companies’ limited use o f forward
contracts at the start o f the campaign to sell their upcoming production o f fiber cotton when
world prices were significantly higher, Burkina’s three ginners s t i l l had a lot o f unsold cotton at
the end o f the 2008/2009 campaign. The lack o f sale contracts, a collateral requirement for the
banking pool, further complicated the access o f cotton companies to their line o f credit for the
financing o f the 2009/2010 campaign. While world prices partly recovered at the end o f April,
they remain below the break-even point. The cotton companies have now resumed sales, which
allowed banks to disburse credits for the new campaign, however a significant financial deficit i s
expected from the three cotton companies for the crop year as a whole. The losses sustained are
enough to trigger the OHADA law on liquidation. SOFITEX’s management i s proposing to
carry out a three-phase financial restructuring to: (i)
reduce i t s capital; (ii)revalue i t s fixed
assets; and (iii)
receive a state contribution o f CFAF16 billion (about US$32 million) on the joint
current account it owns with the Government. Faso Coton and SOFITEX w i l l likely seek
recapitalization from the private sector. Injections o f liquidity may also be needed given that the
banking pool i s forcing the cotton companies to clarify options for business continuity now,
rather than in the fall, as a necessary condition to authorize access to their line o f credit for the
2009/20 10 campaign.
Heavily indebted producers face another difficult cropping season and risk dropping out o f
the sector. A significant proportion o f internal debt has been accumulated over the last few
cropping cycles and appears to be closely associated with the occurrence o f adverse climatic
events in 2006/2007 and 2007/2008. Approximately 25 percent o f producers are affected by
debt, with a debt total o f 4.3 billion CFA (approximately US$8 million) o f which 2.8 billion
CFA was accumulated in the 2007/2008 season alone. A study carried out by the cotton
producer association (UNPCB) shows that about 22,000 producers are indebted toward their
cotton producers group, but that as much as 100,000 producers may have been affected through
their contribution to the existing solidarity guarantee groups. As a result o f either their
indebtedness or because they redistributed their profit last year through the solidarity
mechanism, a significant proportion o f farmers (15 to 20 percent overall, up to 30 percent in
some areas) have renounced growing cotton this coming campaign. Conditions during the

102

2008/2009 campaign risk aggravating this withdrawal from production. Solvability constraints
of the cotton companies from the late sale o f cotton contracts have delayed payments to
producers which are now only expected to be completed in July 2009 - well into the next
cropping campaign. Contrary to expectations until June 2008, producers will not receive an
additional price (“ristourne”) on top o f the floor price o f CFAF165Ikg o f seed cotton. The new
floor price for the 2009/20 10 season will be even lower given developments on world markets, at
CFAFlGOkg (3 percent less than last year). Furthermore, fertilizer prices have only marginally
decreased this year, suggesting an increase in the overall input price (hiked up by financing
costs).
The global financial crisis has catalyzed the current crisis in the cotton sector. The impact
has resulted in a drop in cotton prices on the international market due to declining demand,
increased input prices and more limited access to and higher costs o f credit. However, the
origins o f the crisis are rooted in underlying structural problems related to the lack o f
competitiveness in the sector and limited on-farm productivity. Any response to deal with the
existing debt o f farmers and cotton companies in the short term will therefore need to be
embedded in a broader program o f structural reform and improved competitiveness within the
sector:

The Government i s putting together a sound emergency package to respond to the crisis,
with a focus on immediate measures to save the coming cropping campaign (2009/2010).
The Government’s objective i s to encourage seed cotton production at i t s 2008/2009 level
(452,000 T) in the coming campaign, without distorting long-term incentives set by the pricesetting mechanism. The emergency package includes:

i. extending the production o f GM cotton with the sowing o f 120,000 ha in 2009/2010 and
the coverage o f the entire cotton area in 2010-201 1 by this technology expected to result
in approximately a 30 percent increase in yield and an economy o f 4 insecticide
treatments per campaign.
.. increasing subsidies for fertilizers, subject to availability o f funds, so that input costs to
11.
farmers remain unchanged from last year. This explicit subsidy would amount to CFAF7
billion (US$14 million equivalent), which i s CFAF4 billion more than last year.
... removing the internal debt overhang at the producers’ level without encouraging moral
111.
hazard. Clearing all internal debts o f producer solidarity groups, as the Government
envisages, would amount to CFAF4.4 billion (or nearly US$9 million).
iv.
improve incentives by requesting a revision o f the insurance system among producers to
both provide higher ex-ante collaterals and cap individual liability to the farmers’ group
so that surplus farmers keep part o f their benefit even in bad production years.
V.
launching a comprehensive financial restructuring o f SOFITEX and increase by CFAF 16
billion (around US$32 million) i t s credit line to the cotton company, which constitutes a
contingent liability for the state.
In total, the Government’s intervention package to save the coming cotton campaign could
amount to above CFAFl 1 billion, roughly equivalent to US$23 million, with another contingent
liability o f US$32 million to guarantee SOFITEX’S business continuity.

103

A three year action plan to improve the sector’s competitiveness i s also envisaged. The plan
will address underlying structural problems in the sector, including the managerial efficiency o f
cotton companies, improved management o f the Price Smoothing Fund, reduction in the cost o f
fertilizer possibly through a rotating input financing fund and longer term solutions to producer
indebtedness. The plan will also focus on the roll out o f Bt cotton in accordance with biosecurity
safeguards to increase overall production volumes above the critical threshold o f 500,OOOmt
needed to boost utilization ratios o f installed processing capacity above the minimal level
required to arrive at internationally competitive unit processing costs.
The World Bank has responded rapidly to the crisis with financial and technical support
and remains flexible to providing further support. Through the PRSC series, IDA delivery
was increased and accelerated in 2009 in order to help Burkina’s exceptional budgetary
financing needs and support the Government’s emergency policy reform and institution
strengthening response to the cotton crisis. Additional support i s envisaged in the CAS.

104

Appendix D: Improving the Doing Business Indicators

Over the 3 last years, major reforms achieved related to business start up, property registration,
labor, tax regime, construction permits. This resulted in an outstanding increase o f Burkina’s
ranking in the Doing Business Report from 163 out o f 175 countries in 2007 to 148th o f 181
countries in 2009. This achievement i s particularly notable as the country was also ranked
amongst the top 10 reformers globally in 2009.
Despite achievements, reforms need to be furthered and accelerated in order to improve
Burkina’s overall ease o f doing business index and ranking. Reforms related to trading across
borders i s a priority given that Burkina Faso recorded i t s poorest performance in this domain.

The IFC “Doing Business Better in Burkina Faso” program has launched supportive subprojects, including the Burkina Faso Trade Logistics project, the Burkina Alternative Disputes
Resolution project, support for comprehensive reform o f 22 selected licenses, the withholding
tax regime, the commercial justice system and the insolvency and creditors rights system.

Appendix E: Overview o f the Etude du Scheina National D’Amgnagement du Territoire
(SNAT)

By the National Policy on Land Planning Decree (Decret N o 2006 - 362), the Government o f
Burkina Faso commissioned the National Land Planning Scheme (SNAT). The SNAT’s mission
i s to introduce both a long term perspective and territorial coherence to the development debate
in Burkina Faso by mapping development risks and opportunities. The SNAT involves a three
staged process: (a) a geographical diagnostic o f national development issues; (b) an identification
o f the major concepts, objectives and directions for sustainable development in Burkina Faso; (c)
the validation by Government o f a territorially coherent 20 year national development strategy
for Burkina Faso. This appendix provides an overview o f the diagnostic and second phase
elaboration o f the SNAT. The Government i s yet to validate the SNAT.
Context - national realities

The SNAT diagnostic underscores the impact o f Burkina’s unsustainable population growth and
land degradation. Burkina’s population has tripled in the last 30 years and agricultural growth
has relied upon the degrading expansion o f land for cultivation (at a rate o f 3 percent per year).
I t warns that the nation i s fast-approaching spatial saturation and over population, which will
have dire consequences for Burkina’s food security, socio-economic and human development
and socio-territorial harmony.

The SNAT emphasizes the importance o f developing a long t e r m national policy which i s not
founded on poverty reduction alone. The focus should be to harness the nation’s dignity and
enable Burkina to steer i t s own direction. Burkina’s transition towards development i s a long
process. The next 20 years ought to be conceived as a transition period in which the country
embarks upon the significant task o f reversing negative trends. The SNAT indicates that this
will be a difficult period which will yield few tangible results.
FundamentalChallenges:

Demography and the Role of Women

Burkina Faso i s situated at the start o f phase two o f the demographic transition chart, with
persistently high birth rates and lowering death rates. Annual growth rates are between 2.5 to 3
percent, resulting in a doubling o f the population every generation. Current population i s
estimated at 13.73 million. In order to reach sustainable population growth, Burkina needs to
develop a clear and decisive national strategy to maintain i t s population below 20 million by
2025. This will require a reduction in the population growth rate fiom 2.5 percent to 1.9 percent
in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2025. The SNAT identifies two key elements to curbing population
growth: (1) intensive family planning and improved access to quality broad-based health services
for women; and (2) modernizing societal attitudes towards the role o f women, including their
economic participation, rights and social insertion.

107

Education

The SNAT envisages the creation o f a new, educated and technically trained rural population,
capable o f improving agricultural productivity. The SNAT warns that the focus on increasing
access to education has negatively impacted upon the quality o f education. Teacher-student
ratios are a key challenge. To sustain quality education, the number o f teachers needs to increase
by 8.5 percent per year until 2025. The SNAT recommends that secondary education initiatives
should be expanded in areas which demonstrate good potential. Tertiary education and research
needs to be properly aligned with the needs o f the country and the existing university poles
require reinforcement. Bobo-Dioulasso i s identified as a prime candidate for becoming a pole o f
excellence for research and education in agricultural activities and agro-processing industry.
Agriculture and its integration with livestock

The SNAT emphasizes the importance o f developing food self-sufficiency rather than food
security (which includes the concept ‘of imports) in Burkina Faso. It highlights the need to
increase productivity o f traditional food crops (millet, sorghum) and products o f good potential
(rice and potatoes). I t also recommends (i)the integration o f agriculture and livestock to
improve manure usage, (ii)improving land management in cotton cultivation; and (iii)
harnessing the unrealized potential o f Burkina’s fertile shoal (bas fond) regions, with the aim o f
extending cultivation to an additional 300 000 ha o f bas fonds in 20-25 years.
Environment and Land Tenure

The environment and land tenure reform feature as central and over-arching preconditions for
sustainable development. The SNAT indicates that, contrary to common perceptions, Burkina
Faso does not lack water resources, instead the major constraints relate to regionally
disproportionate and irregular rains and poor water resource management. The SNAT
commends the preparation o f the National Rural Land Tenure Reform Policy, but raises concern
over the implementation o f the land reforms. The SNAT recommends a staged land reform
implementation process, involving the immediate identification o f priority areas e.g. bas-fonds
areas, zones o f conflict over land tenure.
Decisive factors

The SNAT identifies three decisive factors which w i l l direct the course o f Burkina’s
development: (1) urbanization; (2) desenclavement; and (3) water and energy. Burkina’s current
urbanization rate o f 20 percent falls well below those o f other Sahelian countries. Rural
communities remain cut o f f from markets due to the low urbanization rates and poor internal
connections. 78 percent o f agricultural products do not reach markets, 15 percent reach markets
connected to the rural road networks and only 7 percent reach urban markets. The SNAT
highlights the importance o f well-managed and progressive urbanization for development. It
recommends particular focus should be placed on internal desenclavement and farm to market
access (80 percent o f the population are rurally based and the road network services only 22
percent o f the country). It also highlights the importance o f extending external rail connections
(recommendations include: (i)extend rail Abidjan, Ouagadougou, Kaya up to Dori; (ii)link
Bobo with Mali through Koloko; (iii)resurrect dialogue on the rail project to connect with
108

Ghana; (iv) implement a rail link with Benin-Niger via Fada N’Gourma). Investments in
renewable energy sources, regional energy interconnections and water management are also
discussed.
Vectors o f growth

The SNAT draws upon the opportunities that exist within different regions and identifies good
growth potential in industry, mining, tourism and handicrafts.
The SNAT proposes the gradual creation o f different ‘zones o f activity’ to stimulate wellplanned urbanization, job creation and growth. Several zones are suggested, including: rural
micro-centers, the grouping o f particular skills around particular villages, industrial zones,
logistical export platforms and business districts. In the context o f tourism, the SNAT
recommends harnessing the small potential niche market by crating 5 regional tourism hubs in
Fada NGourma, Dori, Ouahigouya, Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou. The creation o f these
zones will require close coordination with rural communes and supportive land reforms.
Cross-cutting issues

Two cross-cutting issues are identified in the SNAT. The credibility and effectiveness o f the
State will depend upon clear delineation o f regional responsibilities. The SNAT also proposes a
new system o f international cooperation with regional neighbors and donors. Burkina needs to
deepen i t s engagement with regional neighbors and assume a more prominent leadership position
in steering donor interventions.
The SNAT map

The SNAT mapping exercise spatially depicts geographic constraints (ecological and overpopulation) and opportunities (fertile regions, bas fonds, concentration o f high potential
products, markets, infrastructure, transport, areas o f urbanization, mining, tourism, transborder
commercial exchange areas etc)) for development in Burkina. It does not cover social services
which ought to be equally distributed. The map reveals that population density does not
correlate with the most fertile rain-fed areas. This i s largely due to historical and tribal factors.
The map also shows that over-population predominantly affects the central band o f the country.

109

Appendix F: Policy note on Regional Growth Poles (May 2009)

1.
The objective of this note on growth poles i s to elaborate on the spatial approach
adopted under the first strategic theme of the proposed Country Assistance Strategy FY1012, relating to intensification and diversification o f the economy. The note is intended to
provide a quick overview o f the theoretical underpinnings o f the growth pole approach, o f
experiences in other countries, current policy orientation and existing studies in Burkina. The
note will form the basis for further discussions with the Government and the country team aimed
at defining the parameters o f a possible World Bank-financed operation to support the
development o f regional agricultural growth poles.

The principal objective o f a growth pole i s to develop economic activities around one
o r multiple industries o r sectors o f potential, by targeting a critical mass o f investments
(economic infrastructure, private sector development, institutional reforms, policies to support
enterprise and industry). The purpose o f developing a pole i s to catalyze value added activities
and to encourage clusters o f entrepreneurial investment. Given the right conditions, enterprises
are likely to regroup into clusters to improve organization, coordination and competitiveness so
that they can compete more effectively in external markets. The formation o f entrepreneurial
clusters facilitates shared use o f the means o f production (treatment o f surplus production by one
enterprise to avoid the losses o f another) and common training o f actors or technical support
targeted at enterprises situated within the pole. The essential characteristics which determine the
competitiveness o f enterprises in growth poles, according to Nadvi (1999) are: access to markets,
flexibility and availability o f human capital, the effects o f intermediate consumption,
technological advances and, joint action by enterprises to associate or collaborate with a common
purpose.

3.
The development o f a growth pole can either be initiated by the spontaneous
regrouping of enterprises and other actors in the same domain o r promoted by specific
public policy. The State’s role in promoting growth poles is one o f facilitator and coordinator
and involves the development o f infrastructure and the implementation o f a host o f public
measures directed towards encouraging private sector investment and enhancing
competitiveness. A strategy for growth pole promotion should identify specific measures to
remove constraints, improve quality and productivity, encourage domestic and international
investment and enhance infrastructure.
4.

Growth poles can be in the form o f regionally delimited poles o r targeted value
chain poles. In order to determine whether a regional or value chain approach i s most
appropriate, an analysis into (i)the sectors and value chains with growth potential (ii)the
investment constraints in these areas and (iii)the location and state o f existing economic
infrastructure (energy, transport, markets, ICT, etc) i s necessary.

Regional growth poles can be developed around one or several sectors and can take
several forms including: (a) the formation o f specially delimited zones or industrial
zones, (b) the installation o f industrial parks near the areas o f production (perimeter
planning) to encourage agro-processing and light industry, and (c) the installation o f
110

technology parks and business incubators to create poles o f research and scientific
enhancement.
Value chain growth poles involve the organization o f and specific support to actors
and service providers in selected supply chains as well as the adoption o f policies to
promote investment and enhance productivity. Innovation and human capital are
central to both growth pole approaches and require the strengthening o f scientific
research, the use o f business incubators and the scaling up o f professional training
within the particular poles.
Growth pole experiences in Africa

5.
A regional growth pole approach was adopted by the Malagasy Government in
2003-2004 following a series o f studies and analytical work initiated by the authorities and
the World Bank. The objective was to enhance growth by reducing constraints to investment,
improving the investment climate, focusing on developing infrastructure and access to finance
for business and strengthening the capacity o f human resources. The approach was implemented
through a multisectoral project in three regions o f the country which corresponded naturally with
potential growth sectors: the Nosy-BE pole for tourism; the Fort Dauphin pole for mining and
tourism (with an innovative PPP with Rio Tinto) and the Antananarivo-Antsirabe for export
growth.
5.
The impact o f this operation o n the Malagasy economy resulted in an exponential growth
o f private investments from US$84 million in 2005 to US$1,045 million in 2007 and the creation
o f 500 new businesses and 10 000 new formal jobs between 2006 and 2008. Progress in the
poles has recently been constrained by the international crisis and internal political turmoil,
although the infrastructure which was constructed (railway, port and hotels) appears to have not
been affected.
6.
A value chain growth poled was adopted in Cameroon. The country focused on three
sectors: forestry, tourism and ICT. In forestry, the Government has decided to promote
investment and transformation o f the forestry sector, strengthen the capacity o f the relevant
actors and improve technical training. In tourism, investments in infrastructure (road
rehabilitation, PPP for hotels etc.) and capacity development are envisaged. In the I C T sector,
the Government has decided to create a technology park with a training centre. A specific
program for improving access to finance in the three sectors and a framework for promoting
domestic and foreign investment will also be put in place. I t i s too early to measure the impact
o f this approach on the economy.
Burkina Faso’s Economic Diversification Strategy and the relevance o f the growth pole
approach

7.
The Schima National d’Aminagement du Territoire (SNAT) presents a
comprehensive diagnostic of the country’s social and economic challenges. The S N A T
provides recommendations for economic growth and diversification which include: (i)the
establishing support mechanisms for commerce;
improvement o f economic infrastructure; (ii)
(iii)
facilitating access by economic actors to resources (finances, production inputs, technology
etc); (iv) increased revenue generation for the population through better access to markets and;

111

(v) support to small and medium processing industries. These recommendations build upon the
orientation o f Pillar 1 o f the PRSP.

8.

Diversification i s addressed as a national priority in the context of rural
development under the Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Government has initiated a policy
o f diversifying export revenue sources through agriculture, agro-processing and the promotion o f
tourism and mining. The Government has also developed an integrated platform o f reforms to
release constraints to the investment climate and facilitate private sector investment. Over the
last three years Burkina has made significant progress in improving the investment climate and
the country was classified amongst the top ten performers in the world in the Doing Business
2009 report, particularly in relation to the creation o f business, labor market regulation and
construction permit regulation.

9.
A sectoral policy o f private sector development i s in the process o f preparation, as
well as specific strategies on export promotion, quality, standards and norms and a new
industrialization policy. A coherent plan o f action to regroup the approaches i s under
preparation.
10.

The World Bank has supported reforms to the investment climate and helped carry
out analysis to identify sectors and value chains that have a strong potential to accelerate
growth and diversify in Burkina.” The series o f analyses have converged in indentifying the
major potential drivers o f growth. Agriculture i s identified as an essential sector for
diversification with important growth potential in cotton oil, fruit and vegetable processing,
meat, leather and skins. The Government has already prepared a project for a tomato and mango
processing plant in Loumbila to respond to the need to transform surplus production o f these
products and to increase their value as export products.

11.
The BurkinabC administration has invested in a series o f studies on regional poles o f
competitiveness and territorial planning as part o f its diversification strategy. There is a
clear recognition o f the challenges related to spatial saturation and the limits o f existing
production and exportation schemes. A study on the poles o f competitiveness explored the
potential o f 13 regions in Burkina to be transformed into poles comprised o f clustered business
investments and technology zones in which partnerships between scientific research and private
enterprises are promoted. The SNAT also provides a prospective analysis o f spatial
opportunities and challenges in Burkina, taking into account population growth. I t identifies
particular growth sectors and calls for the gradual creation o f zones o f activity as well as sound
urban planning to support employment creation and revenue generation. Several zones o f
activity are suggested including rural micro-centers, village clusters o f business and specialized
skills, industrial zones and logistical export platforms.

12.
The current discussion on diversification in the country i s aligning around the
spatially concentrated growth pole approach. The Government has recently indicated its

50 The DTIS completed in 2007 identified a number o f potential value chains for which Burkina Faso has a
comparative advantage. Sectoral analyses prepared under the PAFASP project have targeted 5 particular value
chains. The CEM provides a detailed analysis o f diversification and the sources of growth in Burkina Faso.

112

intention to develop spatially concentrated regional growth poles in objectively identified areas
o f growth potential which demonstrate favorable characteristics for mineral exploitation or highvalue (selected value chain) agricultural production and processing. It i s noted that this approach
requires a strong commitment at the highest level and strengthened inter-ministerial coordination
to ensure effective roll-out o f growth pole investments and reforms. The Ministries o f
Agriculture and Livestock, as well as the ministries responsible for trade, the promotion and
organization o f exports will need to be particularly implicated. The growth pole approach will
provide an ideal opportunity for the country to implement the National Strategy on Export
Promotion and the national policy on quality standards.

13.
Agro-industry, identified as one o f the drivers o f growth and diversification,
requires specific spatial planning of zones around the areas o f production. A land reform
law, in the process o f being adopted, establishes the regulatory framework for land use and
agricultural production in rural areas. It confers secure land rights to farmers and promotes the
expansion o f developed perimeters o f modern farming. The creation o f medium-sized industrial
plants requires the development o f a coherent strategy to ensure adequate land allocation,
investments in economic infrastructure (water, energy, transport) and public utility services. To
ensure the market competitiveness o f agro-industries, professional training and capacity
development, support for the quality standardization and adherence to international norms,
coupled with improved access to finance are critical.
14.
The potential o f mineral exploitation remains limited due to the lack o f rail
infrastructure which would facilitate the transport o f heavy minerals (manganese, phosphates).
A public-private partnership to develop infrastructure could encourage exploitation and
developing the full potential o f the mines could be envisaged as part o f the growth pole
approach.
15.
The tourism and handicraft sectors also have potential for growth although tourism,
in particular, requires concerted efforts to (i)
disenclave regions through better road connections;
(ii)
develop public private partnerships at an international level and; (iii)
develop policies to
improve the capacity and professionalism o f actors in the industry.
16.
The challenge for the Government will be to strengthen the competitiveness o f
identified high value supply chains at a national level (a process which i s underway already) and
to develop regional growth poles by encouraging the emergence and clustering. o f modern
enterprises through the provision o f qualified and skilled personnel and necessary infrastructure
and services. The CAS seeks to fiuther the dialogue with the Authorities on the development o f
regional growth poles and provide financing to target investments in identified agricultural
growth poles in order to catalyze investments and growth.
Examples o f potential growth poles in Burkina Faso

17.
A more thorough analysis and extensive consultations are necessary to properly
identify growth poles in Burkina. Given that the first objective o f this note i s to contribute to
the discussion on the type o f growth pole approach to adopt in Burkina, it would be premature to
propose with finality any specific regions or zones. However, certain regions naturally form the

113

,

source o f supply chains with value adding potential and a few examples o f potential growth
poles are presented below to further the d i s c ~ s s i o n ~ ~ .

18.
Example o f potential agriculture growth pole in the Haut-Bassins region: The Haut
Bassins region i s comprised o f three provinces, Houet, Tuy and Kenedougou. The largest city in
these provinces i s Bobo-Dioulasso which accounts for over half o f the population o f the region.
The potential o f the region i s manifestedin:

The supply o f high value agro-pastoral products: cotton, cereals, livestock, sesame,
cashew, fruits and vegetables (with a particular abundance o f fruit in Kenedougou 24000 tonnes per year)
Existing economic infrastructure: an industrial zone i s already in place in Bobo and
plans are underway for the installation o f an additional 2 zones: the airport could
provide transport opportunities; a multimodal platform for transport recently
constructed i s directly linked with the railway which connects to the nearest port city
o f Abidjan; the re-opening o f roads and rail networks with the Ivory Coast will
enhance market access for the region which suffered badly during the Ivorian crisis; a
central electricity interconnection with Ivory Coast will enable reduced factors costs.
A core o f enterprises in the region with strong concentration in Bobo: the figures on
entrepreneurial activity from the Chamber o f Commerce state that 4120 enterprises
exist in the region, o f which 65 percent are in commerce, 26,2 percent are in services
and 8 percent are in industry. There are numerous small and medium manufacturing
and processing plants (oil processing, dairy, fruit juice, dried h i t and vegetables) as
well as large enterprises such as CITEC (cotton oil, soap cottonseed meal), SOFITEX
(cotton), BRAKINA (drinks and mineral water), FILSAH (cotton thread) and
DAFANI (fruit concentrates and juices). Other industries in metallurgy, mechanics,
chemicals and auxiliary products are also found in the region and have developed
exportation links with the sub-region, W A E M U countries and Europe and the
Maghreb (cotton).
A promising experience in agrobusiness i s the DAFANI factory which started in 2006
with a production capacity o f 12000 tonnes. The factory has relied upon a similar
structure to SOFITEX, using a partnership with local producers to ensure primary
product supply.
Support structures (Chamber o f Commerce, MEBF branch, CEFORE, CEFAC) and a
laboratory for quality control which could be used to lift the quality o f export
products to conform with international norms and build the capacity o f exportation
companies.

19.
Example o f a potential agriculture pole in the Cascades region: The Cascades region
i s situated in the south west o f Burkina Faso extending from the Haut Bassins region. I t i s
comprised o f 2 provinces, Comoe and Leraba. Potential in the region includes:

Existing WE3 fmanced operations have targeted support to a few value chains: PAFASP adopted a combination
value chain approach by targeting four production basins for onion production (Ouahigouya, Koudougou, Sourou,
Tenkodogo). However, the project lacks sufficient linkages with market access, ago-processing and quality
assurance. This underlines the need for the development integrated service zones

114

Supply of agricultural products: cashew, mangoes and bananas are the fruits most
produced in the region. The region i s the second largest producer o f horticulture after
Haut Bassins and the largest producer o f cashew in Burkina. Cashews are exported
on a large scale to India and Europe. Sugar cane exists as a potential export product,
even though the industrial processing unit has encountered financial difficulties in
recent years. In this region, the accent could be put on the processing o f fruit,
vegetables and cereals (processing o f cereals, dried h i t , cashew hulling)
Economic infrastructure: the rail linking Burkina with Ivory Coast traverses t h i s
region and i s in a good state; a special industrial zone could be created to attract the
emergence o f private processing investment
The existence o f a number o f agro-industrial enterprises: even though there i s no
formal industrial zone, the region accounts for some o f the largest food processing
units like SOSUCO (sugar), SOPAL (alcohol and molasses) SOFITEX (cotton), SNGMB (imported wheat flour conditioning). Some o f these entities are on the verge o f
bankruptcy but the emergence o f other enterprises o f medium size capable o f
developing economies o f scale could produce a positive effect. The existence o f a
number o f associations and cooperatives specialized in exportation i s equally an asset
which could be used to link production and manufacturing with larger installations for
export.
Administrative support structures could be reinforced to enable entrepreneurs to
obtain administrative documents and make arrangements at a local level.
Example o f a potential tourism growth pole: A Bank evaluation o f the different tourist
sites conducted in 2008 identified priority areas with probable future tourist potential and those
secondary sites with limited potential. The evaluation also examined the possibilities for
creating sustainable revenue in each area. The evaluation established a l i s t o f sites by order o f
Arly (ii)
Nazinga (iii)Hippopotamus Lagoon and Banfora (iv) Sahel (in
priority, namely (i)
particular Oursi with i t s l i n k s to the Dogon region o f Mali). To develop these areas as regional
tourism growth poles, however, it would be necessary to develop the sites, create a PPP at an
international level with a strategy o f disenclaving the access to the site and strengthen the

20.

professional capacity within the sector.
Example o f a mining growth pole in Tambao. The development o f the mine in
21.
Tambao for the exploitation o f manganese requires a heavy investment in rail infrastructure
which would have positive externalities for access to market by other export products (livestock,
agricultural products etc). According to the mining study in the CEM, the Tambao mine
contains 19 million tonnes o f manganese reserves with an average content o f 50 to 54 percent
Mn02. The feasibility study indicates an investment o f US$844 million i s required with
investments in the order o f US$350 million for the construction o f the rail line f i o m Kaya to
Tambao. This line o f 250 km would open the north o f the country and would link through
Ouagadougou, the D o r i Niamey line which i s envisaged in the development plans. A PPP for the
construction o f the mine and the railway could be explored because o f the positive externalities
for export o f other products, the disenclavement opportunity, and the possibility for
transportation o f 500 000 to 1000000 tonnes per year over 20 years. The benefits o f this mine
and infrastructure need to be verified with specialists and more detailed studies.

115

22.
The selection o f the growth poles will require a further analysis o f the potential, needed
investment and existing capacities. However, a set o f requirements will always apply:

0

clear synergy will need to be established with the development o f targeted human
capital. This will involve the creation o f technical professional centers, technical
training in food progressing, technology transfers with foreign business partnerships,
industrial maintenance, professional tourism training, finances, call centers,
networking etc.
measures to catalyze the creation and installation o f a significant number o f medium
size enterprises in all o f the identified sectors will need to be put in place.
partnerships to facilitate private domestic and international investment need to be
created.
promotion o f clusters requires a cross-sectoral approach which focuses on a
panoply o f issues including, production, distribution, the development o f a suitable
skills base, adapted and disseminated technology (local and foreign), the development
o f professional technical training, and efficient intra-enterprise partnerships and joint
action. The m a l development and private sector specialists must work together and
develop a coherent plan that addresses the development o f growth poles in an
integrated manner.
Institutional support by the authorities, as facilitator, and the development partners i s
imperative. Such support might include, the securing o f land tenure for farmers in the
poles, agribusiness, access to economic infrastructure (transport, electricity, water,
telecommunication and broadband internet for poles dedicated to services) as well as
the conditions for exploitation, concession zones for tourism and facilitation
procedures for handicraft exportation.

116

Appendix G: The CAS Approach to Demography

I.

Challenge o f Rapid Population Growth

1.
Burkina Faso has not yet started the last stage o f its demographic transition, i.e. the
decline o f fertility. The current rate o f population growth i s estimated at 3.1 percent per year,
translating into a doubling time o f the population in less than 23 years. Unless fertility declines
rapidly, population growth will accelerate due to improving mortality conditions and reduced
emigration flows. Today, almost half o f the Burkinabe population i s less than 15 years old. The
potential for population growth, which i s built into the young age structure (a phenomenon
known as the population momentum), will further exacerbate the rapid population growth and
contribute to the youthfulness o f the age structure.
Rapid population growth will require that greater levels o f public spending be
2.
mobilized for the formation o f human capital and the delivery o f basic services, in
particular in education and health. This situation will be aggravated by the youthfulness o f
the population as this translates into larger demand for services. In addition, the small formal
employment sector will face huge pressure f i o m a fast growing working age population and job
creation will become a critical issue. Finally, the rapidly rising Burkinabe population will
increase the demand on the agricultural sector, whose productivity i s already weak, and will
hasten land saturation and environmental degradation.

11.

Government Response

3.
Over the past decades, the lack o f strong political action contributed to a failure
to significantly lower fertility rates and slow down population growth. The demographic
crisis that has resulted now demands concerted political commitment and engagement. First, the
consequences o f rapid population growth for development and human capital investments need
to be fully understood and acted upon by the Burkinabe leadership as well as their development
partners. This will require enhanced advocacy in the area o f population and reproductive health
as well as the strengthening o f the current institutional framework to address population issues.
Second, development strategies including poverty reduction programs need all to factor in the
importance o f demographic change, including the use o f consistent data and more realistic
assumptions.
Importantly, the Government has recently demonstrated clear political
A new
commitment to addressing demography as a critical development constraint.
development strategy forecast for 2010-201 1 envisages placing heavy emphasis on demography
as an ‘emerging development issue’.

4.
The implementation o f the new National Population Policy (NPP), revised in
2000, has been disappointing. The efforts in the area o f population and reproductive health
require consistent and long programmatic efforts that are supported with a strong Monitoring &
Evaluation (M&E) framework. Instead, the NPP presents a broad spectrum o f interventions that
are not time-bound and do lack precise quantitative targets. Furthermore, programmatic
documents, such as the health strategies, do not address directly the issue o f the contraceptive
prevalence rates. Even specific documents, such as the contraceptive security strategy, remain
too vague and do not use quantitative planning tools.

117

5.
Interventions in the area o f population and reproductive health urgently require
scaling up. The demographic evolution generally assumed in Burkina Faso’s development
strategies w i l l not happen automatically, but can only be achieved with more proactive policies.
Moreover, the coordination between strategies for different sectors needs to be strengthened by
mainstreaming a coherent use o f population data and consistent population policy interventions.
It i s suggested to focus the effort on a few key interventions that can possibly and rapidly bring
demographic change. These include: strategic use o f realistic demographic data for programs’
design; effective information, education, and communication campaigns aimed at behavior
change; universal education especially for girls; access to quality family planning services; and
better employment and economic opportunities o f women.
111.

The Country Assistance Strategy Approach and Demographic Change Filter

6.
I n most Bank strategic documents in Burkina Faso (e.g. Country Economic
Memorandum, CAS), population growth i s identified as being amongst the most important
development constraints (this i s also the case in the SNAT or Etude Sche‘ma d’ame‘nugement du
territoire funded by the African Development Bank). The CAS draws upon the new political
enabling environment to target demography as a cross-cutting issue which affects Burkina’s
major development changes o f growth and social service delivery. A holistic approach i s
adopted which incorporates: (i)
policy dialogue and technical assistance; (ii)
targeted operations;
and (iii)
portfolio mainstreaming.
7.
The Bank seeks to draw upon its comparative advantage in policy dialogue to
promote greater government and stakeholder engagement in demography and to establish
clear linkages between population growth, macro-economic stability and poverty reduction.
8.
Analytical support and technical assistance will help to guide government
policies, communication strategies and activities. In order to assist the Government in
developing well-targeted and effective population interventions, IDA will support a more
detailed analysis o f the underlying determinants o f high fertility and limited use o f family
planning. Through technical assistance, IDA w i l l work with other partners such as UNFPA, to
support the Government in updating its population policies and developing and implementing
effective information, education, and communication (IED) and behavior change communication
(BCC) campaigns.
9.
IDA financed operations will also target demographic issues. Several existing
IDA projects in education, health, and community driven development, support the deceleration
o f rapid population growth. These operations include components to improve: female literacy
and education; women’s access to, and involvement in economic activities and governance. The
Health Support Services and HIV/AIDS program specifically supports access to reproductive
and sexual health services, including family planning. The Transport Sector Development
Project also incorporates a component on HIV/AIDS education, which includes improving
access to condoms. The design o f these operations relies already on realistic demographic data.
A new reproductive health operation in FY 10 will strengthen government initiatives to improve
access to family planning and increase modern contraceptive usage. The C E M highlights the
immediate significance o f improving access in order to meet the high level o f m e t
contraceptive needs in Burkina Faso (currently at 29 percent). As the Bank i s a new player in
addressing population growth and reproductive health in Burkina Faso, partnerships with other
118

agencies that have greater comparative advantage will be explored to assist in effective
implementation.

I n order to highlight the importance of demography as a development issue and
10.
support the widespread dissemination o f information and education, the World Bank will
pilot the application o f an innovative demographic change filter throughout the portfolio.
The filter will draw upon expertise within the Bank and will be designed in collaboration with
the Government and relevant stakeholders. I t will provide task teams with a check l i s t o f options
to integrate demographic issues in the design o f new projects and AAA work, as well as in the
retrofitting o f existing projects (if feasible). The filter will encourage:
(a) The use of adequate and sound demographic data in the design ofproject andor AAA
activities. This will also entail the use o f such data in a strategic manner. For
example, urban projects should target their interventions according to the best
available demographic data on urbanization in order to prioritize the neediest
populations. This may call for the gathering o f the best available data and analyses to
be included in the project design;

(b) The incorporation of a consistent communications stratem on demographic issues.
The filter will include a communications strategy, aligned with the relevant new
government strategies, to guide task teams in mainstreaming a consistent and clear
message on demography in all lending and non-lending operations.
(c) Where relevant, the inclusion of speciJic population and family planning IEUBCC
components in order to reach project personnel and/or constituencies (this i s
especially important for projects that involve communities and/or community
leaders). This approach will mirror the approach adopted by existing projects to
address HIV/AIDS. Information and education about family planning choices and
options will empower women and couples to take conscious decisions on
childbearing and enable behavior change.

(d) Where relevant, an assessment of the impact of the project development objectives
(PDOs) on demographic and reproductive health outcomes. For example, an urban
project could estimate the impact o f urban improvements on demographic outcomes
such as improved use o f contraception among urban populations.

Appendix I:Lessons from the Client Survey 2008
Globally, respondents o f the client survey identified government effectiveness/ governance and
access to education as the top development priorities for Burkina Faso, followed by poverty
reduction and growth. When considering poverty and growth, the survey findings indicate the
overwhelming view that agricultural productivity i s a critical element to both poverty reduction
and generating faster growth in Burkina. At the same time, the survey findings indicate a clear
understanding o f the link between poverty and growth, and private sector development,
governance, and access to education.

An interesting dissonance emerges between where stakeholders think the Bank focuses i t s
attention and resources, and where they think the Bank should focus i t s attention. A plurality o f
respondents reported that the World Bank considered growth i t s primary priority (followed by
governance and environmental quality). However, nearly a third said that the Bank should focus
primarily on agriculture productivity, followed by education, growth, environmental quality and
infrastructure.

Mean Importance

In summary, respondents would like to see the Bank significantly involved in key priority areas agriculture, education and growth in particular - less so governance which they consider the top
development priority in the country. The survey findings also suggest opportunity for greater
emphasis on private sector development (potentially more coordination with IFC perhaps) and
focus o f research and knowledge.

The Bank received high ratings in a number o f areas related to i t s behaviors, relationships and
work. Stakeholders consider the Bank very responsive and forthcoming with information. In

123

addition, they strongly believe that the Bank gives appropriate priority t o growth in Burkina.
Overall, the Bank i s viewed as ‘fairly relevant’ in Burkina.
Areas for improvement include:

-

-

-

Sectoral activities: Ratings o n some o f the Bank’s key priorities in Burkina, agricultural
productivity, food security, energy security and the cotton sector are fairly low.
Relationships: While respondents reported that they liked to work with the Bank, their
ratings o n whether the Bank treats stakeholders with respect is low.
The way the Bank works: The Bank i s rated quite l o w o n flexibility, prompt disbursement
o f funds and whether it works efficiently.
The Bank’s programmatic recommendation and strategies: The survey indicates that
there is concern about h o w sustainable and realistic the Bank’s strategies are in Burkina.
Changing the way the Bank does business: The survey results show overwhelmingly that
respondents consider obtaining Bank’s financing overly complex. In addition, more than a
third o f respondents believe that the Bank would increase its value in Burkina if i t s experts
had greater knowledge o f challenges that Burkina faces.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION

BURKINA FASO
Joint BanMund Debt Sustainability Analysis

Prepared by the staffs o f the International Development Association
and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Carlos A. Primo Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
and Michael Atingi-Ego and Anthony Boote (IMF)
May 20,2009

The debt sustainability outlook for Burkina Faso is aligned with the results of the previous
debt sustainability analysis @SA) update carried out in November 2008. 52 Despite a clear
increase in projected gold exports in 2010, the medium- and long-term export outlook
deteriorates slightly because exports of cotton are reduced. Burkina Faso is still classijed
as a medium performer 53 and the country remains at high risk of debt distress.

VII.

BACKGROUND

1.

The analysis presented in this document i s based on the stock o f Burkina Faso’s
debt at end-2007. The stock o f debt was established following a creditor-by-creditor and
loan-by-loan reconciliation exercise that was carried out in April 2008 and showed a
negligible discrepancy between the authorities’ and creditors’ data. Moreover, the stock o f
debt at end-2008 has been estimated based on aggregated information provided by the
authorities.

2.
Burkina Faso’s external debt i s composed in the largest part by financing from
multilateral creditors, which account for almost 80 percent o f the total o f outstanding
loans. The share o f the World Bank represents about one third o f the total, that o f the AfDB
about 15 percent, and that o f the IMF about 3 percent. Loans from bilateral creditors
represent about 20 percent o f the total, o f which about 90 percent were extended by non-Paris
Club creditors. Burkina Faso’s loans have long maturities, with an overall grant element
which currently stands at about 48 percent and i s projected to remain above 35 percent for

the entire projection period o f the DSA. W h i l e there i s a gradual decline in the grant element
to about 37 percent by 2028, this i s explained for the most part by a shift in emphasis in new
lending from multilateral to bilateral creditors. With regard to the composition o f external
financing, the grant-financing share amounted to 56 percent in 2008.

3.

Since the transition from a centralized to a market-oriented economy in the
early 199Os, Burkina Faso's Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment
to stay current on its external payment obligations. This includes the period before the
country benefited from debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative
(HIPC), when the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio was well above 200 percent. The 35 percent
concessionality floor i s strictly enforced for all central-government foreign-currency
borrowings, and projects are consistently scrutinized by a National Public Debt Committee
before negotiations are concluded.

VIII. UNDELRYING MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The medium-term outlook for growth i s generally unchanged from the previous
DSA. Projections for real GDP growth hold over the medium-term, but have been lowered
by 1.4 percentage points for 2009 and 1.9 percentage points for 2010 because o f the
slowdown in global demand, notably in the cotton sector. As a result, nominal GDP
projections are slightly lower than in the previous DSA, but the upward trend i s clear for the
medium and long t e r m (Figure 1, Panel 1). Real GDP growth i s projected to average
6 percent in the long run, in line with the average for the past ten years. Inflation i s projected
to decline to 4.8 percent in 2009,2.3 percent in 2010, and to the historical average o f about 2
percent in 20 11.

Recent commodity price developments warranted a revision o f some projections
on the external sector compared to the previous DSA. In the near term, the projected

139

decline in cotton prices will be offset by an increase in the price o f gold and a decline in o i l
prices, leading to an improvement in the terms o f trade o f about 10 percent and a narrowing
o f the current account deficit. The medium term export outlook has been revised for the
following reasons:
e

Commodity prices: Cotton prices have declined by about 40 percent since their
August 2008 peak; they are about 21 percent lower for 2009 and 14 percent lower for
2010 than the previous D S A projected (Figure 1, Panel 5). O n the other hand, gold
prices are expected to be about 29 percent higher in 2009 and 27 percent higher in
2010.

a

Exchange rate: The value o f the US dollar relative to the CFA franc has been revised
upward by 5.7 percent, which over the medium term reduces the total value in U.S.
dollars o f Burkina Faso’s exports.

e

Medium-term export potential: The first significant change i s a downward revision
in the value o f cotton exports based on lower export prices and the negative impact on
supply o f the increase in cotton inventories globally. Due to the shortage o f arable
lands, the share o f cotton exports as a percent o f GDP is projected to decline
markedly over the long term (Figure 1, Panel 2). The second important change comes
from a dramatic increase in the volume o f gold exports in 2010, from 10.5 tons in the
previous D S A to 16 tons currently, because o f the operations over the next ten years
o f a new gold mine. W h i l e exploration i s underway for additional mines, which
could lead to significantly higher gold exports, this i s not reflected in the assumptions
o f the current DSA. A third change concerns the increase from 2015 onward in the
exports o f fruits, vegetables and cereals as the authorities’ agricultural diversification
strategy comes into play.

7.
The current account deficit i s expected to narrow moderately in the medium and
long run as the tighter fiscal stance dampens import demand. Export growth i s driven in
the medium term by the projected increase in gold exports in 2010 and in the long term by
efforts to diversify agricultural production away from cotton and into fruit, vegetables, and
cereals.

Revenue is lower in the near term, but will gradually recover to reach 17 percent of GDP, contributing
to a reduction in the fiscal deficit over the medium term. While lower than expected in 2008, external
borrowing requirements for the medium term remain in line with those of the previous DSA.

EXTERNAL DEBT S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y A N A L Y S I S

8.
There are no significant changes to the indicators compared to the previous D S A
(Figure 2). Under the baseline scenario, there i s a slight deterioration in the N P V o f debt-toexports ratio, the only indicator that breaches the indicative thresholds. With the decline in
cotton exports over the long term, the ratio peaks at 196.4 percent in 2024, compared to
190.7 percent in the previous DSA. Nevertheless, all other debt indicators remain
comfortably below the thresholds.
9.
Furthermore, the rate of external debt accumulation under the baseline scenario
i s projected to remain manageable. The annual increase in the N P V o f public external debt
i s substantially below 3 percent o f GDP per throughout the projection period and,
notwithstanding a small increase in the medium term, it i s projected to remain at about
2 percent o f GDP. Additional grant financing could improve the debt sustainability outlook
significantly. Whereas D S A projections are based o n a conservative 50 percent grantfinancing share, raising the grant-financing share to 55 percent in the projection period would
lower the peak N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio by about 20 percentage points.
10.
Stress tests and alternative scenarios show Burkina Faso’s debt outlook as
vulnerable to large shocks to exports and less favorable financing terms. The NPV o f
debt-to-exports and the debt service-to-exports ratios rises and stays above the threshold
under some tests. In particular, these ratios are most vulnerable to a scenario o f exports
remaining subdued and growing below historical levels (Figure 5). While all the other ratios
remain below their indicative thresholds throughout the projection period, stress test show
there are,vulnerabilities, in particular to a combination o f lower GDP growth and a lower
share o f grants in external financing (bounds tests B2 and B5 and alternative scenario A2 in
Table 2, respectively).

142

Figure 2. Burkina Faso: Current vs. Previous DSA
The main risk comes from the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio. Despite an improvement in the near term
because of higher gold exports, long term the ratio deteriorates slightly because cotton exports fall.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

11.
How vulnerable i s the debt sustainability outlook to further backlash from the
current global crisis? The baseline scenario o f the DSA assumes (i)a continued
improvement in revenue performance to meet the WAEMU target o f 17 percent in 2015 and
(ii)
a moderate decline in the share o f cotton in total exports that i s compensated in the
medium term by a significant increase in the volume and value o f gold exports.
The alternative scenario assumes a further decline in projected revenue
12.
compared to precrisis levels, a worsening o f the outlook f o r cotton, and lower gold
prices as the global recovery starts to take hold:
Revenues are lower by 0.5 percentage points o f GDP in both 2010 and 201 1,
before gradually recovering to their baseline level by 20 17.
Cotton prices are 10 percent lower in 20 10, returning to the baseline in 201 1.
Cotton export volumes are 20 percent lower in 2010, an impact that carries
over into the medium and long run as producers diversify away from the
sector in response to lower prices in 2009 and 2010 and declining prospects.
Gold prices are 10 percent lower in 201 1 and 5 percent lower in 2012 and
20 13 before catching up to the baseline level in 20 14 (Figure 3).
13.
The results under the alternative scenario do not foresee a significant
deterioration o f the debt sustainability outlook, and most debt sustainability indicators
would be little affected over the long term. The indicators remain below their indicative
thresholds for medium performers, with the exception o f the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio,
which exceeds 200 percent (Figure 4).

144

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

14.
The results for the fiscal DSA are similar to those for the external DSA.
Domestic debt is low-gross domestic debt is estimated at approximately 2.7 percent o f GDP
at end-2008, and net debt at 1.3 percent o f GDP. Moreover, it is assumed to decline further
over the projection period as the authorities seek to avoid more costly domestic financing o f
the fiscal deficit. As a result, public debt dynamics are largely determined by the evolution
o f external debt.

15.
Public debt indicators could worsen under some scenarios. The standard
sensitivity tests reveal the public debt outlook to be vulnerable to persistent large primary
deficits and an unexpected increase in debt creating flows, under which the debt ratios would
increase sharply over the projection period. These results highlight the importance to follow
prudent fiscal and borrowing policies. Failure to reduce the current deficits would lead to
ever-increasing debt indicators; however the authorities are committed to ongoing tax
reforms designed to lower the deficit to more sustainable levels.
X.

CONCLUSION

16.
Burkina Faso’s risk o f debt distress i s high because o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports
ratio; all other debt indicators remain comfortably below their policy-dependent thresholds in
the baseline scenario. Nevertheless, the high risk o f distress underscores the importance o f
limiting external borrowing to concessional loans, maintaining a prudent fiscal policy to limit
the accumulation o f new debt, including by sustaining the ongoing tax reforms, and making
continued efforts to diversify and increase exports. Moreover, the authorities should
continue to improve their policy and institutional environment, which over time may result in
a higher CPIA rating and higher debt thresholds.

Annex 12: CAS Consultations

The country team has engaged in extensive consultations during the preparation o f the
CAS. Consultations involved a four-stage process.
1. In October, a 2 day CAS retreat involving Government, development partners,
civil society, media and private sector took place. Participants reviewed
performance under the 2006 CAS and agreed upon orientations for the new
strategy.
2. Between October and June, a core CAS team consisting o f government
representatives and Bank staff has convened regularly to develop the strategy.
3. In March 2009, extensive consultations in Ouagadougou and 8 provinces
(Yatenga Sourou SCno Soum Houet KCnCdougou Sissili and Nahouri).
Approximately 2000 participants from Government, civil society, rural
communities, local municipalities, universities, media, parliament and the private
sector were consulted on the strategy’s diagnosis o f development challenges and
the approach and areas o f concentration adopted.
4. On 22 May 2009, consultations were conducted with government Ministers.
The approach o f the strategy was well-received during the March and May 2009
consultations. Participants agreed that a spatial approach to diversification and growth
will enhance impact, but stressed the importance o f selecting regions objectively and on
the basis o f thoroughly researched projections. Participants were also strongly in favor o f
support to decentralized social service delivery, citing capacity development for
communes and direct funding to local communes as priorities.
Opinions differed as to the instruments envisaged by the draft strategy. Civil society,
local communities and parts o f the private sector expressed concern that budget support
did not reach intended beneficiaries or the private sector. While development partners
and government counterparts highlighted the importance o f scaling up budget support in
the context o f the global financial crisis. Overall, the consultations highlighted the
importance o f ensuring an appropriate balance between general budget support and
project lending, including direct support to local communes.
The most frequently cited areas for WBG intervention included:
Agriculture and livestock: training o f farmers, irrigation, agro-processing, access
to inputs and finance; access to local and regional markets; land tenure security;
diversification into non-traditional products e.g. local native edible plants
Infrastructure: energy and transport costs; rural roads; explore alternative energy
sources (solar, nuclear); rail
Environmental degradation: natural resource management; disaster risk
management; environmental damage caused by cotton production and mining.
Cotton: debt relief for farmers; subsidized agricultural inputs; World Bank
influence on global commodity price
Mining: environmental protection; support to SMEs

Water and sanitation: particularly in rural communities
Education: adopt a global approach with focus on quality; literacy; and secondary

Food security: cereal banks; storage facilities
Health: education on family planning; geographic access to health facilities;

PPPS.
Good governance and anti-corruption: strengthen oversight institutions
Promotion of women, youth and people with disabilities: revenue generation;

Promotion o f Burkinabe culture
Work more closely with civil society, media and parliament.
Security was raised a concern in rural areas.

The consultations highlighted the need for the Bank to adopt a better communication
strategy in Burkina Faso. There i s generally limited knowledge about the Bank’s
support. Former structural adjustment policies continue to dominate overall impressions
o f Bank performance in Burkina.

The consultations also revealed the need to improve information dissemination on
particular projects, avoid overly complex micro-project procedures and enhance
monitoring and evaluation o f Bank projects in the field through civil society and local
community participation.

Annex 13: Burkina Faso: Fund Relations

Burkina Faso-IMF

Assessment Note for the World Bank

This note provides an assessment o f recent macroeconomic developments in Burkina
Faso and progress under the Fund-supported three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility program (PRGF). This assessment is based o n the findings o f the mission for the
fourth review that took place in Ouagadougou March 18-April 1, 2009.
Recent Economic Developments and Program Performance
In 2008 and early 2009, Burkina Faso's economy weathered the triple external shocks
(oil, food, and the global financial crisis) fairly well. Real GDP growth reached an
estimated 5 percent in 2008, supported by a rebound in agricultural production and the
opening o f 'three new gold mines. With the decline in commodity prices, inflation f e l l to
6.8 percent year-on-year in March 2009 after peaking at 15.1 percent in June last year.

Domestic food prices, however, have declined less than international prices. The trade
deficit widened to 11.O percent o f GDP, from 8.8 percent in 2007, because o f higher o i l
imports and lower cotton exports.
Despite difficult economic conditions, program performance was broadly in line with
objectives. All quantitative performance criteria were met, including the targets for the
fiscal deficit, revenues, and social expenditure. However, foreign-financed capital
expenditure was some 2% percent o f GDP lower than programmed, mainly due to poor
project planning and execution and higher costs that required renegotiation o f loans.
Despite progress o n preparation for tax policy reform, some delays have occurred
because o f late delivery o f technical assistance, inadequate domestic capacity, and the
challenging external context.
Outlook and Policy Challenges

The global financial crisis influences the near-term outlook and is constraining growth.
Monthly trade indicators and trade-related revenues are slackening. While lower prices
dampen the outlook for cotton exports, the impact on the balance o f payments will be
cushioned by agricultural initiatives, lower o i l prices, and higher gold prices. Real GDP
growth is projected to decline to 3 % percent in 2009. Changes in commodity prices are
expected to improve the terms o f trade and slightly narrow the current account deficit.
There are risks to the outlook. Further decline in world cotton prices could threaten the
financial stability o f the ginning companies, which would have negative side-effects for
the entire economy. A worsening global crisis could also further push down remittances,
foreign direct investment, and other financial flows, lowering investment and

157

consumption. An unexpectedly fast global recovery would support a turnaround in
Burkina Faso.
In this difficult environment, the key challenge i s sustain the reform momentum, with a
particular focus on fiscal reforms to raise revenues, and growth-enhancing reforms to
make the cotton sector more efficient and the financial sector stronger.

While there i s some scope for countercyclical fiscal policy, debt sustainability concerns
call for caution, and grant financing will be especially important in the event that
downside risks to revenue materialize. Medium-term fiscal consolidation remains
necessary to reduce the high risk o f debt distress, and while the fiscal deficit on a
commitment basis i s projected to widen to 5.1 percent o f GDP in 2009, it should decline
to 4.1 percent o f GDP by 201 1. Preparatory work for tax policy reform i s underway with
a view to revise the business tax, streamline tax exemptions, and strengthen VAT.

In the cotton sector, though financing for the next campaign has been secured on
conditions similar to last year’s, the capital base o f SOFITEX, the largest ginning
company, i s eroding, and producer association internal arrears have risen. Reforming the
sector i s critical if the country’s medium-term growth and development objectives are to
be achieved. The authorities have stressed their commitment to increasing the
transparency and efficiency o f SOFITEX. Staff encouraged the authorities to work
closely with the World Bank and take the necessary steps to increase productivity.

The financial system has so far weathered the global financial storm, but could be
vulnerable to a drying-up o f liquidity, an increase in nonperforming loans as the economy
slows, credit concentration, or withdrawal o f foreign banks if disruptions in international
Better surveillance, supervision, and risk
financial markets should intensify.
management at both national and regional levels are thus essential. Staff encouraged the
authorities to ensure adequate follow up to the financial sector action plan that was
submitted to Cabinet in March 2009.
Overall, we believe that the PRGF-supported program will provide a sound
macroeconomic framework to guide the authorities’ reform efforts. Staff w i l l continue to
maintain close coordination with donors.
Relations with the IMF

The Executive Board discussion o f the fourth review under the PRGF arrangement i s
scheduled on June 22, and the mission for the 2009 Article I V consultation and fifth
review under the PRGF arrangement i s expected to take place in September.

Annex 14: Donor Coordination in Burkina Faso
Since the adoption o f the Paris Declaration in March 2005, the Bank has been working
with other development partners to align support with Burkina Faso’s priorities and
policies (as laid out in the PRSP) and coordinate donor activities to reduce transaction
costs and achieve greater results.
In 2007 the National Action Plan for Aid Effectiveness was produced and a coordination
body (la Coordination Nationale de 1’EfficacitC de 1’Aide’ ‘CONEA’) was established to
facilitate aid effectiveness and donor coordination in Burkina Faso. A National
Coordinator for Aid Effectiveness was also appointed to act as an interface between the
Government and development partners.

The Government has recently re-asserted i t s commitment to leading the aid coordination
process, particularly in the context o f the upcoming Accelerated Growth and Sustainable
Development Strategy. In April 2009, the Government released a new Concept Note on
Improving Aid Effectiveness which focuses on strengthened government leadership and
enhanced mutual accountability. To lower transaction costs and facilitate coordinated
development partner monitoring o f the PRSP,the Government and development partners
have agreed to the formation o f a ‘troika’ o f donors to lead discussions and represent the
development partner community. The Government has also launched the preparation o f a
study on technical assistance and the national policy on public aid in Burkina Faso. To
centralize and monitor systematically the various aid flows, the Government i s in the
process o f establishing an Aid Management Platform based on web technology
developed by the Development Gateway Foundation (DGF). This platform will
strengthen alignment o f donor interventions behind national priorities, improve the
predictability o f aid flows, support the coordination o f assistance by the Government and
allow better results monitoring o f aid flows.

A technical secretariat (STELA) was established in 2005 to support development partners
in aligning behind the country’s National Action Plan for Aid Effectiveness and in
developing a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS). While progress has been slow, the
development partners have recently renewed their commitment to develop a JAS
following the introduction o f the next Poverty Reduction Strategy expected in 20 10- 11.
A retreat will be conducted in FY 10 to consolidate the approach o f development partners
towards aid coordination in Burkina and clarify a country diagnostic in preparation for
the development o f the PRSP. Development partners have also committed to improving
information sharing through the Country Analytic Work website.
Results from the 2008 Survey on Monitoring Paris Declaration show that the Bank has
made substantial progress toward the Paris Declaration targets but more efforts are
needed to deepen these achievements. The Bank i s on track to meeting the Paris
Declaration targets for use o f public financial management (PFM) systems and has made
progress on increasing lending through Program-Based approaches (PBAs) as well as
conducting joint analytic work.

160

Program-Based approaches (PBAs). Since 2000 the World Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategies have supported CSLPI and I1 implementation. The CAS 2006-2009 results
matrix clarifies the link between World Bank-supported activities and PRSP objectives.
Programmatic approaches have been adopted in the education, health and water sectors,
although full fiduciary integration i s yet to be achieved due to inadequate country system
implementation.
Use of national financial systems. Significant progress in strengthening public finance
management has allowed increased use o f national P F M systems by the development
partners. The 2008 Survey on monitoring Paris Declaration indicates that 58percent o f
Bank disbursements in 2007 used national PFM systems against 3Opercent for the
African countries group that responded to the survey. The Bank undertook a PER jointly
with the African Development Bank, UNICEF and European Union during the CAS
period.
Reliance on parallel PIUS. The Government and external partners are making some
effort to progressively integrate PIUs into country structures. The Bank i s increasingly
relying on single PIUSto coordinate multiple projects for a sector, including community
driven development, transport, water and rural development. The size o f PIUs i s being
progressively scaled down. Their role and functions are shifting from project execution
to capacity building and coordination. The Bank has made real progress in integrating
project management into existing national structures. The 2008 Survey on Monitoring
Paris Declaration shows that 1OOpercent o f the Bank-financed projects were integrated
into national structures in 2008.
Coordinated Technical Assistance. A progressive move toward budget support i s
helping the Government and external partners strengthen coordinated capacity support
around country needs and priorities. In January 2005, the Government signed a
Memorandum o f Understanding for joint budgetary support, the Cadre gCnCral pour
l’appui budgCtaire (CGAB), along with nine external partners: the AfDB, France,
Denmark, the EC, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the World Bank.
The CGAB provides for coordination o f all participating partners’ capacity building
activities to strengthen public financial management. External partners also committed to
rely on national expertise to conduct analytical work related to public financial
management. The Government has recently introduced a new monitoring structure to
combine budget support and PRSP monitoring. The World Bank will lead donors as
chair o f the CGAB process in FY 10.
Joint analytic work. While analytical work i s mostly carried out separately, some effort
i s being made to conduct joint analytical work. The 2005 Country Procurement
Assessment Review was conducted jointly by the AfDB and the World Bank. AFD and
the World Bank also supported two environmental impact assessments in the power
sector and relied on them to launch parallel operations. In FY07, external partners also
supported the Government in assessing the quality o f financial management through the
PEFA framework and in FY09 a joint PER i s being carried out on decentralized basic
service delivery.

Annex 15: Country Financing Parameters
Date: June 15,2009
Item
A. Cost sharing
Limit on proportion o f individual
project cost that the Bank may
finance

Parameter
up to loopercent

B. Recurrent costfinancing
Any limits that would apply to the
overall amount o f recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may
finance

N o country-level
limit

C. Local costfinancing
Are the requirements for Bank
financing o f local expenditures
met, namely that (i)
financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would
exceed the public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation and
other revenues) and expected
the
domestic borrowing; and (ii)
financing o f foreign expenditures
alone would not enable the Bank
to assist in the financing o f
individual projects.

Yes

D. Taxes and duties
Are there any taxes and duties that
the Bank would not finance?

None

Remarks Explanation
Bank financing for individual projects may be up to
loopercent o f project costs. This i s determined by: (i)
the availability o f the IDA financing envelope; and (ii)
the prioritization outlined in the revised PRSP and the
new CAS. Full financing o f project costs i s expected
to be applied selectively, primarily for operations
supporting regional HIV/AIDS programs and reform
efforts. Cost sharing will likely be the rule in projects
with contributions from other sources than
Government, co-financing by other donors, and
projects with revenue generating and SWAP
mechanisms.
Given the country’s fragile financial situation, the
Bank will continue to monitor the aggregate fiscal and
debt situation, and its implications for recurrent cost
financing. In all cases, recurrent cost financing will
be
applied after consideration o f sector and project
sustainability issues including:( i)institutional
arrangements to allow for greater emphasis on
sustainability through result-based M &E systems, and
strengthening o f capacity at national and local level;
implied future budget outlays.
and (ii)

The criteria for Bank financing o f local costs are met.
Therefore, the Bank may finance local costs in any
proportion as needed for individual projects.

Currently, there are no excessive taxes or duties in
Burkina Faso. At the project-level, the Bank would
consider taxes and duties constitute an excessively
high share o f project costs.
