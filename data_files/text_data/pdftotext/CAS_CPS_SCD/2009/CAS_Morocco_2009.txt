EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Morocco’s considerable development achievements over the past decade have initiated a
process of social and economic transformation, positioning the country as one of the leading
reformers in the MENA region. Morocco i s strategically positioned between the European Union and
Sub-Saharan Africa, endowed with both Mediterranean roots and a long Atlantic coast, and i s a leading
member of the Arab world. Successive governments have invested in solid macro-economic
management, progressive opening of trade with regional and global partners, and an ambitious process of
legal, policy and institutional modernization that has far-reaching political, economic and social
dimensions. Sustained higher growth rates have led to a decrease in absolute poverty and unemployment
levels, while access to services of education, clean water, and rural roads has improved. These
achievements have been recognized internationally. Morocco has reached investment grade status. I t had
i t s second successful international bond offering without external guarantee in 2007. I t has become one
o f the leading destinations of foreign direct investment in MENA. It i s the only country in the MENA
region to have signed an advanced status agreement with the European Union. The international
development community recognizes the relevance and quality o f i t s development program, and i s
providing increased levels of resources and support.

1.

ii.
Buoyed by ten years o f good economic performance, Morocco i s showing resilience in the
global crisis. The economic outlook i s relatively favorable. The past ten years have seen sustained
output growth, falling unemployment, rising investment, substantial reduction in public debt, and low
inflation. This performance i s largely due to sound macro-economic policies combined with determined
implementation of structural reforms. The financial crisis has had limited direct impact on the economy.
Implementation of a stimulus package has helped the most affected sectors and social groups deal with its
impact. Monetary and exchange rates policies remain appropriate. The macroeconomic outlook i s
projected to remain favorable. Higher financing needs, should they arise, can be dealt with through the
domestic market as well as a planned increase in longer-maturing external financing. The external
position i s projected to remain sustainable over the medium term.

...

Despite this progress, Morocco still lags on human development outcomes. Absolute poverty
has decreased sharply, from 15.3 percent to roughly 9 percent between 2001 and 2007, but economic
vulnerability (near-poverty) remains widespread meaning that a quarter of population - 8 million people remains either in absolute poverty or under constant threat of poverty.. Unemployment stands at a 30year low (9.6 percent in 2008) but youth unemployment i s high, social protection coverage i s limited, and
better jobs are needed for inequality to decrease. There has been a remarkable increase in access to
education, but overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity in access to secondary education remain very
high. Both education quality and learning outcomes severely lag those of other countries with similar
income levels. Despite progress in increasing overall l i f e expectancy and reducing average infant
mortality rate, levels o f infant and maternal mortality remain unacceptably high, and lag MDG targets.
Inequality and urban-rural disparities in poverty and social outcomes remain a challenge. Youth
exclusion i s a concern. Social and human development challenges are at the core of the current
government program, including the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) and health and
education strategies developed since 2007.

111.

iv.
The main long-term challenge i s to achieve higher growth and employment creation, while
reducing social disparities and ensuring the environmental sustainability o f the development model.
Firstly, achieving higher and more sustained growth i s key to solving the unemployment challenge and
will require a combination of higher quality human capital, an improved business environment, better and
cheaper access to key infrastructure services, and a more competitive private sector capable of driving

f

increased economic diversification and export-orientation in a global economy. Secondly, reducing high
inequality will require social protection systems and safety nets and a reduction o f the rural-urban gap.
Addressing the lagging condition o f women i s a priority. Access to quality social infrastructure and
services such as roads, health, education, water and sanitation, and electricity i s key to achieving positive
spillover effects from urban growth-poles. Thirdly, ensuring long-term environmental sustainability
requires addressing head-on the increasing vulnerability to climate change. Here, the immediate and
overwhelming concern i s to cope with increased scarcity o f water. This requires transformative change in
water allocation and management practices, as well as in institutional roles and capacities. Transforming
the energy sector i s the next objective, focusing in particular on enhancing energy security while scaling
up mitigation efforts. Morocco’s energy risks can be better managed through closer regional integration
and can benefit greatly from carbon financing options.
Starting in 2007, Morocco elaborated a comprehensive set of new sector strategies to lead
v.
economic and social transformation over the next five years. In assuming the throne in 1999, King
Mohammed V I set out a vision of rapid growth, improved transparency and governance, poverty
eradication, and better social conditions. Since then, successive governments elaborated and sought to
implement this vision. The government program for the period 2008-2012 frames the main directions for
reform. The program has three main objectives: (i) improve social indicators by focusing on health,
education, and more effective social protection; (ii) enhance growth, export potential and investment by
focusing both on relevant transversal issues and on key sector strategies (industrial emergence, energy,
water, agricultural development, export strategy, and justice); and (iii) implement cross-cutting reforms
that influence results in all sectors, such as improving governance, reforming public administration and
deepening decentralization and deconcentration for better service delivery. This was followed by a major
effort o f strategic formulation in key sectors, starting with the six priority sectors: health, education,
agriculture, water, and energy, with justice s t i l l under preparation. Budget allocations, with a multi-year
commitment, were increased substantially for these sectors.
The Bank Group’s objective over the next four years i s to support implementation o f the
vi.
reform program. The government’s program i s encountering implementation challenges typical of
second generation reforms. This i s the area where the WBG has been specifically asked to help. Firstly,
the WBG will contribute on “the how to” o f implementation by facilitating institutional reform,
sequencing of steps, and change-management, This i s an area in which Bank’s DPLs and analytic
program have developed a solid track record. Secondly, the WBG will continue to support reform
implementation in areas requiring inter-agency coordination, and capacity building, through both S I L s
and DPLs accompanied by analytical work. Finally, as requested by the government, all CPS activities
will seek to pay particular attention to increasing the results orientation o f country programs. The CPS i s
structured around three thematic pillars o f relevance to both IBRD and IFC: (1) growth, competitiveness
and employment; (2) service delivery to citizens; (3) sustainable development in a changing climate; and
two cross-cutting “beams”-- governance and territoriality.
The government i s inviting the WBG to increase i t s financial support, remain an engaged
vii.
knowledge partner, and maintain a flexible approach. The CPS ensures continuity in the WBG’s
support to government, as well as opportunities for scaling up and expanding engagement to new areas
(e.g., climate change, skills development, or new opportunities opened by the Arab World Initiative, the
Clean Technology Fund, or the Concentrated Solar Plan). CPS implementation will be characterized by
flexibility to respond to new reform opportunities or challenges (a key lesson of the CAS Completion
Report), and a focus on monitoring results (both helping the government monitoring its program as well as
tracking results from WBG activities). This i s ensured by a flexible and evolving CPS framework, built
around 19 program areas (encompassing lending and knowledge activities) which are at different stages o f
development. This provides a medium term (24 months) business plan o f firmly developed activities
where expected outcomes can be laid out, as well as a longer term strategic framework to foster selectivity,
ii

including areas where activities will be defined later. I t i s envisaged that the CPS result matrix will be
fully up-dated mid-point through implementation.
viii.
The government has requested IBRD lending of $600 million annually. This level is
confirmed for FY10, with lending levels for FYll-13 indicative. This adds up to an expanded IBRD
program in Morocco, focused on reform. Government asked the Bank for help in addressing structural
constraints and long-term challenges, and particularly with reform implementation. As stated by a
Government official during a joint CPS brainstorming, “from the Bank program, the project we seek i s
about the implementation o f reforms”.
ix.
I n line with the principles o f additionality and selectivity, I F C i s expected to deploy a sizable
investment and advisory program, contingent on demand and market conditions. IFC’s investment
strategy will complement IBRD activities in close alignment with the CPS pillars. IFC will focus on
financial and infrastructure sectors, as well as on high value-added investments in manufacturing, social
sectors (health and education) and agribusiness. IFC’s potential investments in energy, utilities or ports
as well as select investments in Emergence’s sectors, would contribute to Pillar 1 o f the CPS (growth,
competitiveness and employment). Potential investments in the banking sector, microfinance and the
education sectors would help improve financial and educational services to citizens (Pillar 2). Finally, the
focus on potential investments in renewable energy will contribute to Morocco’s sustainable development
objectives (Pillar 3). IFC will also continue to deliver its on-going advisory program, in support of
business environment and financial sector reform.
The international development community’s engagement in Morocco i s well coordinated
x.
and guided by national programs and strategies. The CPS stands ready to take this further and
actively support the EU advanced status agreement. ODA has grown significantly in recent years,
although it remains a modest portion of total public expenditure. Delivery i s characterized by alignment
with government programs, an advanced level o f coordination, and increased use o f budget support and
country systems. IBRD and the EU are currently engaging jointly in five key sectors (health, education,
MDH, PAR, and rural roads), for a joint total financing above $900 million. This strategic collaboration
i s expected to increase as the EU advanced status agreement evolves. In this context, the government has
expressed a preference for working with DPLs in support o f policy reform, and it i s expected that this
should represent a large proportion o f the program. The CPS will seek to advance the greater use o f
country systems, as requested by the government.
xi.
The CPS identifies the risks to the program and proposals to mitigate them. First, the shortterm growth outlook i s subject to uncertainties on the timing, speed and shape o f the recovery from the
global crisis. The Bank will help analyze the risks through continued monitoring and dialogue with the
authorities on the overall macroeconomic context, as well as through analysis of options for remedial
measures and program adaptation, contingent on need and government request. Second, the successful
implementation o f the reform agenda i s dependent upon political economy factors. Second generation
reforms will likely see resistance from affected interests. Possible outcomes include the derailing of
reform objectives, a stalling o f the reform process, and a decline o f the credibility o f the reform agenda in
the eyes o f public opinion. The Government’s recent emphasis on governance reforms, such as that o f the
justice sector, will help mitigate these risks. The Bank will offer appropriate TA - with, if requested, a
specific focus on political economy constraints - to support the implementation o f sector strategies.

MOROCCO: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY10-13
I.

INTRODUCTION

1,
The World Bank Group’s engagement in Morocco i s framed by four parameters. These are
clear national development goals, substantial challenges alongside considerable achievements, an
increasingly sophisticated client, and requests for an expanded engagement to support further reform.
2.
The Government has set clear development goals that guide public policy. Since the
accession o f King Mohammed V I in 1999, successive governments have articulated a pro-development
vision for public policy, based on strategies that identify constraints and target reform o f key sectors.
Public funding i s then allocated to strategic priorities. The result i s a program o f political, economic, and
social reforms whose effects are starting to be visible, even as much more remains to be done.

3.
Morocco’s recent development ‘trajectory i s one o f contrasts. Considerable achievements in
establishing a sound macroeconomic framework, reducing poverty and extending access to basic services
have not yet allowed it to achieve key social indicators, which in areas like health and education remain
well below those o f comparable countries. The contrast between growth on one hand, and poverty and
exclusion on the other, i s a main development challenge.
4.
Morocco i s an increasingly sophisticated client. Clarity in strategic direction i s matched by
capacity in central government. Engagement takes place in an environment where development finance i s
growing, but remains modest relative to the overall national development program. The Government
increasingly seeks on-demand technical and strategic assistance.

5.
The WBG’s program in Morocco is expanding, focused on support to reform. The
government has asked the Bank for help in addressing structural constraints and long term challenges, and
particularly to support implementation o f the reform agenda. As stated by a Government official during a
joint CPS brainstorming, “for the Bank program, the project we seek i s about the implementation o f
reforms”. The identification of the Bank as a key partner for reform implementation has led to requests
for engagement in multiple sectors and for increased financial support.
6.
This document lays out the Bank Group’s first Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Morocco. In providing the framework o f future engagement, it formalizes the shift from assistance to
partnership. The document describes the context by highlighting the contrast between the country’s main
development achievements and i t s key long term challenges. It presents the Government’s development
program and i t s implementation challenges. Finally, the document outlines the Bank Group’s strategy in
Morocco over the next four years while addressing the key risks to CPS success. Details and specific data
are presented in the Annexes. More detailed briefing documents prepared in the context o f the CPS are
also available on the Bank‘s web site’.

MOROCCO’S DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENTS

7.
Morocco’s recent development track record i s characterized by positive achievements
alongside substantial challenges. Morocco has performed well in moving i t s development agenda
forward during the past decade. Sound macro-economic management and good economic performance
allowed for sustained capital spending on social and economic infrastructure and an amelioration of key
development indicators. The period 2001 to 2007 saw unprecedented rates o f poverty reduction, with
absolute poverty decreasing from 15 percent to roughly 9 percent. Access to drinking water increased
from 65 percent to 84.5 percent in 2007, net primary enrollment rates increased from 68.6 percent in 1998
to 93.5 percent in 2007 and immunization coverage reached 94 percent. Yet, in spite of the significant
budgetary resources allocated to social sectors (more than 50 percent), key development outcomes in
areas such as education, health and employment are below expectations. This limited progress i s
evidenced by Morocco’s mixed MDG track record and Human Development Index (HDI) performance.
Morocco i s likely to miss its targets on child mortality and maternal health, and lags behind regional
neighbors and countries with comparable GDP per capita in terms of HDI (Figure 1). In acknowledging
that results have been below expectations, the Government recognizes the need to ensure that growth
translates into broad based benefits and to reduce the disconnect between efforts and development
outcomes.

Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook

8.
Morocco’s economic performance improved significantly during the past decade, as
indicated by sustained high growth in output, falling unemployment, rising investment, and low
inflation. Economic growth averaged 5.1 percent over the period 2001 to 2008, almost twice as high as
the average of the previous decade. This performance allowed per capita income to almost double to
reach US$2,850 in 2008. In addition, the growth pattern improved as it became less volatile.
Specifically, it became less dependent on agriculture, a sector that s t i l l accounts for a large, but
decreasing share, of GDP (an average 13 percent). Unemployment declined from 14 percent to 9.6
percent, although questions remain over the quality of the jobs available to large segments of the
population. Investment increased sharply from around 25 percent to 36 percent of GDP, improving the
prospects of sustained strong performance. Inflation remained subdued at about 2.5 percent on average.
Finally, Morocco became more integrated in the global economy, although the share of trade i s s t i l l low
relative to comparator countries (76 percent of GDP), revealing ample room for improvement.

Strong economic performance i s largely due to sound macroeconomic policies and sustained
structural reforms. Since 2005, Morocco maintained sound fiscal policies leading to the consolidation
of public finances. As a result, the budget ran surpluses in 2007 and 2008 (averaging 0.3 percent of
GDP)'. The Government adopted a prudent debt strategy with central government debt declining to 47.3
percent of GDP in 2008 from 62 percent in 2005 (Figure 2). The Government pursued monetary policy
geared toward maintaining low and stable inflation and enhanced financial sector supervision. Morocco's
integration into the world economy deepened through the signing o f many FTAs. Overall, these efforts
have led to a stable macroeconomic situation, stronger public finances, and a sound financial sector.
Morocco gained investment grade status in 2007 from one rating agency, which further reinforced the
confidence of investors, both domestic and foreign.

The Government has implemented a stimulus package to help the most affected sectors and
support incomes. The income support package includes an increase of 10 percent in the wages of civil
servants at the lower end of the salary scale and the minimum wage for private sector employees3.
Effective January 2009, the marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent to 40 percent and will be cut to
3 8 percent January 2010. The upper end of the exempt income bracket has also been extended. Direct
support measures for affected firms include financial relief (guarantees on loans; rescheduling of debt;
help with export insurance) as well as subsidies for training and marketing.

1 1.
Sound macroeconomic policies and efforts to improve competitiveness would allow Morocco
to respond to the global crisis and to position itself to benefit from the recovery o f the world
economy. The government intends to maintain a prudent fiscal stance and to sustain the structural reform
momentum of recent years. Growth rates are projected to improve from 3 percent in 2010 to around 5.2
percent in 2013, mostly driven by domestic demand, both private consumption and investment (Table 1).
Achieving this level of growth over the medium term i s contingent on implementing an ambitious reform
program, and the recovery pace of the main trading partners.
12.
After a temporary higher deficit in 2010, the fiscal stance should remain sound over the
medium term, with fiscal deficits under the targeted threshold o f 3 percent o f GDP. This would

derive from the ongoing fiscal reform and more targeted social programs, as well as a better-controlled
wage bill. The budget deficit i s expected to edge up to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010 before dropping to
around 2.2 percent by 2013. Reaching this outcome implies maintaining momentum of the ongoing tax
reform to broaden the tax base, improve the efficiency of the VAT, strengthen tax administration, and
remove tax exemptions. These measures would offset the negative impact of the reduced top rates on
corporate and personal income taxes. Under these assumptions, revenues are projected to stabilize at
around 25 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, the consolidation of public finances relies on three
critical measures: reform of oil and food subsidies, tight control of the public wage bill, and an active debt
management. Under these conditions, public debt will stabilize in 2010 at almost the same level as that of
2008 (47.6 percent of GDP) before following a downward trend to less than 44 percent of GDP in 20 13.

The financing needs stemming from the higher budget deficit in 2010 and declining deficits
over the medium term are easily financed through domestic market as well as from increased
drawings on external loans (Table 2). In this context, domestic financing would remain the main
source, although external financing would increase. Indeed, since 2006, net external financing reversed
i t s long negative trend to turn positive, reflecting the government’s strategy to slightly change the debt
composition in favor of external borrowing. This financing strategy would ease the pressure on domestic
financial markets and prevent crowding out of the private sector’s investment now that the money market
i s less liquid than was the case in recent years. At the same time it i s consistent with the intention to
maintain a comfortable level of foreign reserves.

The external position i s expected to remain sustainable over the medium term. The current
account i s expected to slightly deteriorate in 2009, and then to slowly decline to 3.2 percent of GDP in
4

2013. The balance of payments i s expected to progressively improve, with lower trade and current
account deficits, which would benefit from improved export performance and a recovery of tourism
activities and workers’ remittances. This scenario assumes continued reform efforts, sound
macroeconomic and fiscal policies, and targeted sector strategies that entail higher public investment.
These would translate into higher private investments (including FDI), and progressive gains in export
competitiveness, including tourism. In this context, external debt i s expected to follow a downward trend
to reach 23 percent o f GDP in 2013 down from 25 percent of GDP in 2010. At the same time, gross
foreign reserves would stay at an average of 6 months o f imports.

manufacturing sector highlights the economy’s limits in productive capacity. The global slowdown and
i t s impact on Morocco’s exports i s a reminder of the need to diversify and enlarge the country’s export
base away from low knowledge, low value-added, traditional products. Low value added exports further
constrain growth as they fail to penetrate external markets and set the economy on a low productivity/low
growth/low wages course. Out o f i t s 20 most important exports, only one was in an activity growing in

Business environment reforms have not yet led to the needed structural transformation of
the private sector. Over the past decade Morocco has a) achieved a stable macroeconomic environment;
b) improved the investment climate - including in the area of infrastructure and regulations; c) adopted an
ambitious FTA agenda; and d) turned i t s financial sector into one of the most developed in the region.
Yet, the progress in business environment reforms has not yet fostered the structural transformation of the
private sector into an engine of a competitive, high-growth economy. Weaknesses remain, especially in
those areas - like regulatory reform - that require a lot of public agency coordination, and where a gap
remains between the rules and regulations as they appear on the books and how they’re applied to
individual investors. Also, some areas of trade policy - including trade logistics and distortions in the
trade regime between importers and local producers - remain weak. Financial sector reforms have yet to
trickle down to domestic SMEs that remain credit constrained.

The unfinished business o f structural reform explains why the decrease in unemployment
rates has not fully translated in improved households' well-being (Figure 6). Sustained growth had a
direct positive effect on unemployment, which stands at a 30 - year low (9.6 percent in 2008 and 9
percent over the first three quarters 2009). But to a large extent, the drop in overall unemployment veils
critical shortcomings in the labor markets and the low quality of growth. In urban areas, unemployment
remains high (1 3.8 percent), mainly for youth (3 1.6 percent), females (20.1 percent), and the educated
(1 8.7 percent). Improvement in employment i s also explained by low and decreasing participation rates mainly for women (26.3 percent) - rather than by the ability of growth to generate enough jobs. In
addition, the quality of the jobs created remains a concern. Recent employment creation has favored low
paid jobs in the informal and agricultural sectors and concentrated on low skilled workers. The labor
market i s also characterized by skill shortages which constitute a constraint to the development of high
value-added businesses.
C.

Poverty, Social and Human Development

19.
After the largely lost decade of the 1990s, the country achieved unprecedented rates of
poverty reduction between 2001 and 2007 (Figure 7). Absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent to
roughly 9 percent. The fall has been more marked in rural areas (1 0.6 percentage points reduction) than
in urban areas (2.8 percentage points). Part of this evolution i s explained by the effect o f sustained
growth on unemployment, which stands at a 30 - year low (9.6 percent in 2008). The recent progress in
poverty reduction made a decisive break with past performance, as for the first time since the 1980s the
absolute number of the poor i s clearly falling.
Although absolute poverty has decreased, economic vulnerability (near-poverty) remains
20.
widespread. Based on official figures, 17.5 percent of the population has consumption levels just above
the poverty line. The combined number of poor and vulnerable or near poor in Morocco i s 26.5 percent,
meaning that a quarter of population - or 8 million people - remains either in absolute poverty or under
constant threat o f poverty. The importance of looking at near poverty (vulnerability) in addition to
absolute poverty results from three factors. First, poverty in Morocco i s measured by using a frugal
poverty basket picking up only the very poor using a poverty line (10 dirhams per person per day) well

6

below that used by countries at similar GDP levels. Second, the period under review was preceded by a
decade of increasing poverty (from 1991 to 2001) during which many near poor were pushed into
poverty. Resumed growth and economic stability helped these transient poor to move back to nearpoverty from poverty, while core chronic poverty remained untouched. Lastly, the recent fall in poverty
in rural areas i s not unprecedented. A similar episode of falling rural poverty was observed between 1985
and 1991, and it was followed by a decade-long deterioration. The see-saw evolution of poverty across
the intermittent surveys in the 1990s reflects the vulnerability of the economy to shocks, and the large
number of people who hover just above the poverty line.

Despite being broad-based, recent progress in. poverty reduction was accompanied by
increasing disparities. The partial closure of the rural-urban gap has not cancelled entrenched
disparities: 70 percent of poverty in Morocco i s s t i l l rural. In 2007, the urban poverty rate was 4.8 percent
compared to 14.5 percent in rural areas. Even though a l l groups among the poor-the extreme poor, the
poor, and the near poor - gained from growth, the pattern of growth was not unambiguously pro-poor and
it was not equally shared. As inequality increased in both urban and rural areas to reach unprecedented
levels, growth for the poor was slower than the average growth and it was still below the levels needed to
reduce poverty by half in 20 years. Regional differences are substantial, but practically all regions contain
pockets of severe poverty in slum areas or in villages.

22.
The overall decrease in unemployment rates has led to reduction in poverty incidence, but
being employed does not necessarily guarantee protection from poverty. An absolute majority
among the poor are working poor. The informal sector, primarily in agriculture, which employs 70
percent of Morocco's labor force, i s characterized by low pay, insecurity of job tenure, and lack of safety
standards. Almost 70 percent o f Morocco's poor are employed in just two sectors (agriculture and
construction) which are characterized by informality. Formal sector workers, especially those employed
by the public sector, are well protected, and enjoy a significant wage premium. The poor, predominantly
without education, or with only basic education, cannot compete for such jobs.
23,
Recent efforts to increase the availability o f educational services and opportunities have led
to expanded access to education at all levels, but have not always translated into improved
outcomes. The national net enrollment rates for primary education increased from 52.4 percent (19907

1991) to 93.5 percent (2006-2007). Net enrollment in middle school increased from 17.5 percent to 43.4
percent (2006-2007), and in upper secondary education from 6.1 percent to 17.5 percent (2006-2007).
This increased enrollment in compulsory education has placed pressure on higher education. It has led to
a substantial increase in student enrollment (about 25 percent between 1993 and 2006). Remarkable
progress has also been made in-ensuring equitable access to education for children. The gender parity
index in primary education between urban boys and rural girls aged 6-1 1 has narrowed from 1.5 to 1 in
the past decade. Nevertheless, the speed with which primary education has been generalized has not been
accompanied by equivalent progress in returns to education, and serious enrollment disparities persist as
children proceed through the education system. While access to primary education i s almost universal,
only 71 percent of children aged 6-11 complete primary schools (MDG 2008), and 72.2 percent of rural
women cannot read (the national average for women i s 52.7 percent). Despite the noted increase in
enrollment rates, the illiteracy rate of the 15-24 cohort remains high (nearly 24 percent) with
repercussions on labor productivity (MDG 2008). The quality of education remains problematic. The
grades of Moroccan students in the TIMSS 2003 survey are low compared to the MENA region and other
participating countries, despite high expenditure per pupil.

24.
Lack o f affordable access to quality services explains why the poor are not benefiting from
the expansion of services. The poor gained from improvements in all social sectors, but not enough to
make a decisive break with their condition, partly because of limited access to services in sectors such as
education, maternal health, and housing. For example, survey data show that only half of the population
uses health services for illness, and this share i s only 40 percent for the rural poor. Services are
underused because of financial, social, and geographic barriers. Low education outcomes of the poor are
related to problems of progressionthrough the system and low quality of education. The main barriers for
the poor in accessing better health care are high (informal and formal) payments, high transportation
costs, and low quality of service. Lack o f adequate local health facilities, combined with poor roads and
expensive transport, particularly hurts women. Overall, the performance of the education sector shows
how the contrast between achievements and gaps i s matched by a disconnect between efforts and
outcomes.

Despite the recent improvement of health indicators, important gaps remain. The health
25.
financing and management systems do not appear to meet the needs of the majority of the population. In
addition to the deterioration of physical infrastructure due to a lack of appropriate maintenance, public
health services suffer from an acute personnel constraint at all levels (medical and management). This i s
reflected in the stark contrast with other health outcomes. Maternal mortality stands at 227/100,000, or
45 times Europe’s average. Infant mortality rates (40/1,000 in 2004) remain intolerably high. The
nutritional status of infants and women remains of concern, with approximately 18 percent of under-five
children considered to be stunted and approximately 9.3 percent wasted. Those in the lowest

I n the absence o f effective safety nets, large out-of-pocket payments for services strain the
budgets o f the poor. In the health sector, until very recently, there was no systematic policy to provide
health insurance to the poor. Major illness i s acknowledged to be one of the most sizeable and least
predictable shocks to the economic opportunities o f families. Healthcare expenditures may lead to
divestment o f household assets (selling o f f property, and so forth), and ultimately to overall
impoverishment. The poverty-ill-health vicious circle can undermine future economic welfare. Progress
in housing and infrastructure i s also uneven. Despite impressive spending on a slum-upgrading program
and a commitment to clear the slum areas, it i s estimated that 780,000 households, or 4 million people,
live in what i s considered “substandard or inappropriate” housing. Massive investments in the water
supply have led to the improvement in access to safe water on a national scale. Yet many rural
households have to travel to get potable water, and non-connected populations in poor neighborhoods in
cities rely on standpipes, wells, or informal vendors.

111.

LONG TERM CHALLENGES

27.
To consolidate its development achievements, Morocco needs to address challenges that are
both immediate and influence long-term outcomes. Over the past three years, the government has led
a number o f diagnostic exercises involving the participation o f civil society, academia and think tanks.
These include the 2006 50th Year Anniversary Report; the 2008 Report of the Superior Council of
Education; the 2009 Report o f the Royal Institute of Strategic Studies (IRES); and the on-going Scenarii
2030 exercise led by the Haut Commissariat au Plan (HCP). These products converge in painting a
picture o f substantial challenges, which can be clustered around three overarching objectives: (i)
achieving higher growth and job creation; (ii) reducing social disparities; and (iii)ensuring sustainability.
The government program, presented in Part IV, strives to addresses them.

Enqulte nationale a lndicateurs Multiples et Sante‘ des Jeunes, ENIMSJ 2006-2007, Ministry o f Health, January 2008). Lastly,
few programs address the needs o f early childhood development either by providing services or by encouraging demand for those
services.

9

A.

Accelerating Growth and Employment Creation

28.
Higher and more sustained growth i s central to solving the unemployment challenge, but
without higher quality human capital, higher growth will not be achieved. Despite being markedly
more positive than in the 1990s, current growth rates are insufficient to absorb the overall labor supply
produced by the country’s demographic transition, the diminishing role o f agriculture in absorbing labor
and a more active role for women in the job market. To enhance job creation over the next two decades,
and to consolidate progress in reducing poverty, Morocco will need to achieve a growth rate above 6
percent a year. Investing in high valued added sectors i s a prerequisite to enhancing growth and
improving job quality, as i s improving the quality o f human capital. Morocco has made progress in the
education sector, but concerns about quality and efficiency remain. Despite evidence that continuous
training increases labor productivity (and private sector growth), only 20 percent of Moroccan firms in the
manufacturing sector train their workers. Another important element to promote productivity growth, and
hence better jobs, concerns the use o f active labor market and retraining programs to target workers
and/or production units in the informal and agricultural sectors. The presence of strong job protection
mechanisms i s usually associated with lower formal employment and the proliferation o f part-time and
informal jobs. Improving labor mobility and wages, and progressively increasing formal sector
employment, will require more flexibility in labor regulation, associated with the introduction o f income
protection mechanisms. Finally, expanding the coverage o f the social insurance system will imply having
a more mobile labor force and workers that are more likely to engage in higher risks higher return
activities.

Weaknesses remain in-areas that require public agency coordination (such as regulatory reform) and in
the enforcement o f laws and their application to individual investors. Several constraints in the business
environment remain problematic for firms, particularly new entrants. Access to land remains a pending
and binding constraint to growth, as are tax rates. More generally, administrative procedures and the
judicial system lack transparency and need to be better managed to avoid corruption, discretion and
privileges to connected businesses. Corruption i s seen as a growing constraint for a representative panel
of businesses interviewed both in 2004 and 2007, and one that disproportionally affects smaller domestic
firms. A consequence o f a constraining business environment, corruption and poor property rights
enforcement, i s the uneven playing field in the business place. Competition from the informal sector and
the dominant position occupied by a few large incumbents hurt the development o f some sectors and the

emergence of new industrial players. These issues are consistently rated in firm surveys as the most
important constraints to businesses (Figure 8).

Private sector development will require further financial market reforms and the
upgrading o f national ICT infrastructure. Morocco has reduced financial sector vulnerabilities,
especially as a result o f the restructuring o f ailing public specialized financial institutions. As concerns
over stability have eased, policy attention needs to be directed to development o f the core financial
system, in particular to (i)enhance efficiency, competition and competitiveness, and improve access to
financial services; (ii)promote the nonbank segment o f the financial sector, notably by strengthening the
role o f capital markets in the economy; and (iii)build institutional capacity to implement and enforce the
recently enacted legal framework for the financial system. Moreover, private sector would benefit from
the emergence o f a domestic knowledge economy driven by investments in ICT infrastructure

3 1.
To achieve its growth potential, Morocco needs to improve the export orientation of its
economy. International experience shows that internal demand alone i s insufficient to sustain high
growth rates. Over the last two decades, growth has mainly been driven by domestic demand, while the
contribution o f net exports o f goods and non-factor services has been increasingly negative. Past policies
and investments have favored the production o f non-traded goods and services with high import inputs
and geared towards domestic markets - real estate,. telecommunications, retail and wholesale services,
transport, and financial services. To reap the full benefits o f international interdependence, the trade
regime needs to redress i t s anti-export bias. So far Morocco has pursued a strategy o f selective market
opening through bilateral or regional agreements (Euro-Med, US-FTA, Turkey-FTA, GAFTA) aimed at
taking the opportunities offered by international markets. The EU advanced status consolidates this
progress, promising further economic integration between Moroccan and the EU and with global markets.
Internationalizationof Morocco’s economy can benefit from a stronger push towards regional integration.
As with other countries in the region, Morocco’s main trade relationships are with non-MENA countries.
The recent progress in opening the economy can leverage the country’s favorable geostrategic positioning
as a bridge between Europe and Africa. But it i s losing out due to the limited integration o f trade,
investments and financial markets at regional level. Increased intra-MaghrebMENA integration can
deliver large potential gains in terms of growth. Despite good recent progress in merchandise trading,
integration remains limited in trade in services, banking and key sectors such as energy and transport.
Required actions include reducing trade barriers, harmonizing the regulatory environment across borders,
and improving trade logistics.
3 2.
Global integration requires the structural transformation o f lagging sectors. The agriculture
sector faces the strongest pressures to change. Moroccan agriculture remains one o f the least productive
in the region, employing almost half o f the labor force but yielding not more than 13% o f GDP. Although
the share of the sector to total GDP i s decreasing, its direct and indirect impacts on the economy remain
substantial, making Morocco’s growth volatile (the 2006 GDP growth o f 7.8% in 2006 fell to 2.7% in
2007 and then increased to 5.6% in 2008). While needing to further diversify the economy, Morocco
needs to transform i t s agriculture sector.

T o tap into I C T - led opportunities and grow to potential in a globalized knowledge
economy, Morocco needs to engage in second generation I C T reform. Morocco enjoyed a first-mover
advantage in the Maghreb at the end of the 1990’s, having engaged early in telecommunications
liberalization and privatization. This first reform enabled fast growth of telecommunications services and
the development of I T and off-shoring industries. But this advantage has eroded with time and the
country i s now facing a number of constraints that are hindering i t s competitiveness: prices are high in
broad-band and mobile segments, reflecting insufficient competition; I T skills are scarce; and ICTexports have remained below those of comparator MICs. For the ICT sector to become a driver of
growth, modernization and economic and social transformation, Morocco needs to engage in further
reforms. In particular, competitiveness of the national I T industry and of the off-shoring SMEs depends
on fast and cost-effective broad-band roll out, increased competition, and empowered regulation.
B.

Reducing Social Disparities

34.
Reducing the relatively high inequality and social disparities characterizing Morocco will
require equity-enhancing growth and targeted social protection policies. Morocco has relatively high
inequality by regional standard (Gini index of 0.407) and one which appears to be increasing over time.
This i s in contrast with other countries in the region (e+, Tunisia), which have managed to gradually
reduce the extent of inequality to a level below that of Morocco, while starting from higher levels of
disparity. One of government’s objectives i s to ensure a fairer sharing of the dividends o f growth and
benefits o f the reforms. As noted above, large groups remain excluded from the recent increase in
employment, with unemployment rate for urban youth and educated youth standing at 3 1.8 percent and
18.5 percent respectively. The recent apparent rapid improvement of some social indicators i s only
weakly affecting broad nationwide outcomes for the poor. Inclusiveness- reaching marginalized groups
and promoting equal access to government services and economic opportunities - requires reform of
regressive policies, such as those on phasing out energy and food subsidies. Supporting action i s needed
to strengthen social protection systems and safety nets, which have a potential to reduce most striking
inequalities.

35.
The rural-urban gap remains large. Today, around 55 percent of the population lives in urban
centers, compared to 29 percent in 1960. In 2025 Morocco’s population will reach 3 8 million, of which
68 percent will be urban. The challenge in this regard consists of responding to the enormous demand for
infrastructure and social service provision arising in the urban axis, without leaving the rest of the country
behind. Since 1985 the demographic trend has been associated with a growing gap between urban and
rural household expenditures, which was partly reversed between 2001 and 2007. Nonetheless, rural
household expenditures remain on average 35 percent lower than urban ones. Cities remain the main
areas of economic dynamism, representing 80 percent of productive activity (industry and services) and
three out of four employment opportunities. Access to and quality of basic social infrastructure and
services such as roads, health, education, water and sanitation, and electricity in more remote rural areas
continue to lag behind those in leading urbanized regions. Strong spatial disparities in education and
health access are associated to pockets of high poverty.
36.
Addressing the lagging condition of women is key to improving development outcomes.
The first challenge i s to reduce maternal mortality, which can be largely prevented or treated if expectant
mothers received prenatal care at equipped facilities. Only 4.3 percent of pregnant women in the poorest
quintile deliver their babies with the assistance of a doctor; 70 percent deliver them at home. The second
challenge i s to increase women literacy over time, by securing equal access to education for girls. The
gender parity index in primary education between urban boys and rural girls aged 6- 1 1 has narrowed from
1.5 to 1 in the past decade but serious enrollment disparities persist as children proceed through the
education system (Figure 9). Morocco i s one of the few countries where the difference in illiteracy rates
between men and women has increased since 1970, rather than experiencing a substantial decrease as in
12

other countries. A large majority of the 2.5 million children who do not attend school are rural girls,
especially in secondary education. Enrollment for rural girls aged 12 to 14 in 2007 was just 15.6 percent.
Unemployment already affects women more than men, and i s likely to increasingly do so in the future.

The reduction o f social inequalities revolves around the improvement of the quality and
coverage of service delivery. Key sectors such as health and education require the implementation of a
range o f institutional development measures aimed not only at extending access but also enhancing
results. These include: (i)introducing greater accountability through improved incentive systems as well
as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; (ii)pursuing the deconcentrationof the sector in line with the
overall public administration reform program. Particular attention needs to be provided to
deconcentrating human resources in order to ensure effective deployment of health and education
personnel and increase productivity; and (iii) enhance equitable provision of health and education
opportunities to the population by diversifying financing and paying greater attention to the
implementation of demand side measures.
C.

Ensuring Sustainability

38.
The impact o f climate change i s already deeply felt, and vulnerability will increase in the
coming decades. The country’s drivers of vulnerability include i t s large reliance on agriculture as source
of income and employment, the scarcity of effective risk management instruments; limited ability of
faster-growing sectors in urban areas to create new jobs and absorb excess rural labor force; and finally,
the relatively large share in total exports (1 5 percent) of products from irrigated agriculture, which overuses increasingly scarce water resources. High value assets in urban areas and tourism resorts, and
strategic infrastructure in transport and other sectors are already exposed to natural disaster risks, which
could be exacerbated by climate change. In the absence of adaptation, projections for Morocco’s climate
over the coming decades depict a warmer and drier climate, with precipitation possibly declining 10
percent by 2030, and twice as much by mid century. Such scenarios could cause declines in rain-fed
yields of up to 10 percent in certain parts of the country, an increase of 10 percent or more in the
probability of poor harvests, and, in irrigation water, a widening between demand and supply, with
inflows to reservoirs expected to decline 30 percent more than rainfall. These impacts could materialize
in the coming two decades, and would likely achieve a much larger scale towards mid-century. In the
absence of adaptation measures, declining cereal yields and shrinking water resources will increase the
country’s dependence on staple crop imports for food provision (currently close to 50 percent for cereals).

13

39.
The current and future challenges o f the water sector will not be met without both
infrastructure development and institutional reform Morocco faces four challenges: (a) there i s
already not enough water to meet current needs, and climate change will severely constrain ability to meet
the expected increase in demand; (b) sector governance and institutions are weak; (c) water use in
agriculture i s inefficient; and (d) access to water supply and sanitation services i s still inadequate (more
than 80 percent o f rural households lack individual water supply connections, and only 5 percent o f the
country’s wastewater i s adequately treated). Because of these challenges, frequent droughts have a major
impact on the economy, public spending i s less efficient than it could be, irrigation water i s frequently
rationed in public irrigation schemes, and groundwater i s running out. Coping with scarcity will require a
better balancing o f supply and demand with a view to making water allocation and planning more
efficient. The country needs better interagency coordination and a reinforcement o f some sector agencies,
as well as better enforcement o f groundwater and pollution control rules. Public funding needs to be
aligned with public priorities, through medium-term expenditure frameworks for the sector. In
agriculture, physical investment coupled with support to farmers can help improve the value that each
drop o f irrigation water generates, but real progress will depend on broader structural changes in the
sector. Subsidies for technologies such as micro-irrigation can help soften the blow o f the necessary
reduction in water use, but only if groundwater use i s strictly controlled. Similarly, to improve water
supply and sanitation services, the government will need to invest more in infrastructure and to fund some
social transfers, as well as making some institutional reforms.
40.
Sustainable economic performance requires transforming Morocco’s energy sector. The
first challenge in this sense concerns enhancing energy security, and ensure that the needs o f energy
consumers-- be citizens or firms-are met at least cost, without creating a burden for the economy.
Morocco’s heavy dependency on energy imports (97%) induces energy supply risks and exposure to price
fluctuations (at $145/barrel in 2008, the total energy bill stood at M A D 71 billion). The expected
quadrupling of the primary energy demand by 2030 will further aggravate the import dependency.
Ensuring security of supply will require a diversification o f an energy mix currently dominated by coal
and oil (87%), a reinforced integration in the Mediterranean electricity market, diversification o f supply
sources for oil and other conventional forms o f energy, development o f indigenous energy resources
(such as solar and wind), and enhanced energy efficiency (which could yield up to 15% o f energy
savings). To meet these goals Morocco needs an institutional and regulatory framework to create the
appropriate incentives and a restructuring o f the sector to ensure financial viability o f the operators.
Secondly, Morocco needs to step up mitigation efforts, not only to reduce local C02 emissions and
participate in the global action to attempt to halt global warming, but also to reap mitigation co-benefits
and carbon finance revenues. The imperative here i s to shift its energy system to a low carbon path.

4 1.
Morocco’s energy risks can be better managed through closer regional integration. The
energy situation in the Maghreb countries i s diverse (with Algeria and Libya being major hydrocarbon
exporters while Tunisia and Morocco are import dependent). However, all countries in the region face
common challenges in terms o f growing domestic energy consumption as well as increasing demand for
green electricity both at home and across the Mediterranean. Morocco has a stake in working with its
regional partners to enhance security of supply in a context o f environmental protection and globalization
o f energy markets.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

National Vision

42.
Since the start o f the decade, Morocco has pursued a renewed national development vision.
This vision underpins an ongoing process o f strategic reform whose main elements can be broken down
according to international, political, social and economic objectives. The international dimension i s one

14

of increased and progressive integration in regional, European, and global markets, and of a strategic
partnership with the EU. Politically, the emphasis lies on respect for human rights, the fight against
corruption, consolidation of electoral democracy and acceleration of the decentralization agenda.
Economically, the vision aims to achieve strong, employment-creatinggrowth through economic opening
and liberalization, support to private sector development and foreign direct investment, major
infrastructure works and selective sector priorities. In the area of social development, it aims to enhance
the performance of the education sector, reduce the incidence of poverty and of rural-urban disparities,
and improve the condition of women.
Over that decade, successive governments have led a process o f legal, policy and
43.
institutional modernization, positioning the country over time as one of the leading reformers in the
M E N A region. They have successfully managed fiscal consolidation, stabilized the economy, created an
environment for sustained growth, reformed the financial sector, and enacted a number of critical legal
changes. They have created new governance institutions, signed trade agreements with key partners, and
re-shaped government programs and budget allocations to better target key social and structural
challenges. The reform of the Family Code (Moudawana) in 2004, the launch of the National Initiative
for Human Development in 2005, and the establishment of the Conseil Supe‘rieur de 1 ‘Education in 2006
are important landmarks of social change. Morocco’s 2008 signature of the EU Advanced Status
Agreement, represents both a strong signal of sustained political and legal reform and an act of
international recognition for the reform process.

B.

Regional and Global Space

44.
Advancing integration with regional and global trade partners has been an objective for
decades in Morocco. Since the early 1990s, Morocco sought to deepen i t s economic integration at
regional and global levels through trade agreements. To this end, it pursued deeper preferential
integration with external actors through signing an Association Agreement with the European Union
effective in 2000, a Free Trade Agreement with the USA in 2004, as well as other preferential agreements
with a number of regional partners.
45.
I n October 2008, Morocco signed an “Advanced Status” agreement with the European
Union, which sets the stage for deeper strategic and economic orientation towards the EU. The
agreement defines new ambitions for the relationship and deepens the previous Association Agreement.
It will frame the EU’s future as a development partner in Morocco. It opens participation in several
European agencies, reinforces Morocco’s position within the EU’s neighborhood policy, and will likely
increase the level o f EU assistance. Over time, it i s expected to lead to convergence of legislation and
regulations with the EU’s in selected sectors, at a pace and sequence which remains to be defined. I t
could open the way for a long term alignment with the Acquis Communautaire, the joint legislative body
of the EU.

Sector Strategies

46.
The new government appointed in 2007 elaborated a national program, centered on
enhancing growth and competitiveness and improving social outcomes. I t launched its Social and
Economic Development Program for the period 2008-2012. The j r s t objective of the program i s to
improve social outcomes, particularly in education, health, access to services including housing, and in
due course to establish targeted safety nets mechanisms as a substitute for ineffective subsidies. The
second objective i s to enhance growth, export potential, and investment in the country by focusing
simultaneously on key productive sectors (industrial emergence, agricultural and fisheries development),
on infrastructure sectors contribution to growth (energy, transport, water) and on cross-cutting enablers
(export strategy, ICT strategy, and business environment). The third objective i s to implement crosscutting reforms needed to deliver results in all sectors: (1) improving governance; (2) reforming public
administration; and (3) deepening decentralization and deconcentration, for better service delivery.
Within these broad objectives, the program identified six priority sectors: health, education, justice,
water, energy, and agriculture. It also increased the budget allocation of these sectors, within a multi-year
framework.

As a first step, key ministries produced comprehensive new sector strategies. These respond
to the overall national vision, target known development challenges, and set measurable stretch targets.
They are well grounded by diagnostics, having made use of an abundant stock of knowledge resources.
They formulate short and medium-term action plans, capable of driving both policy changes and
implementation steps, within a time horizon of 2012 or beyond. Some are supported by newly-created
agencies (Plan Maroc Vert and Emergence) to improve implementation effectiveness. Others rely on the
establishment o f inter-ministerial structures to coordinate transversal issues, such as the ICT (Numeric
2023) or energy strategies. Many are supported by dedicated infrastructure investments and have
benefited from targeted budget increases in 2008 and 2009. Table 6 summarizes ten sector strategies
produced since 2007. While it i s too early to evaluate the results of most of them, some o f the older
sector strategies such as Emergence (industry) have had early successes in attracting key international

18

investors, for example in the automobile, offshoring and aeronautic sectors, or in the tourism sector in the

case of the Plan Azur.

D.

Cross-Cutting Changes

48.
Beyond the elaboration o f sector strategies, the program has focused on selected areas that
impact future development outcomes. These include: (i)experimenting with a new comprehensive
approach to social safety nets; (ii) deepening the focus on governance issues; (iii) improving local
government autonomy; and (iv) continuing support for public administration reform.
Government i s testing a new approach to safety nets designed to better target the needs of
49.
the poor and the vulnerable. The INDH program introduced in 2005.the first large-scale povertytargeted interventions by selecting the poorest 264 urban neighborhoods and 403 rural communes. It
remains the key vehicle of targeted poverty interventions, and has contributed to changing the policy
direction on safety nets. The current approach i s pragmatic. It pilots ways to introduce new social safety
nets, while developing and improving their targeting and effectiveness through evaluation. Examples
include: ( 1) implementation of a conditional cash transfer pilot in education, aiming at increasing school
retention rates (the Tayssir program); (2) pilot introduction of a medical insurance scheme for the poor
(RAMED), which i s now in the process of being scaled-up; (3) improved geographical targeting o f food
subsidies (tender wheat flour); (4) implementation o f a low-income housing construction program; and
(5) improving institutional capacity to target policies and subsidies. In addition, increases in minimum
wage have been enacted, as well as an increase in children allowances and extension of their coverage to
workers of the agricultural sector. A comprehensive review of social protection i s also under way at the
same time as a review of food and energy subsidies.
The governance program builds on previous initiatives. During the past decade, successive
50.
governments have launched a series of governance programs. These include the 1995 national program
for good governance, the 1998 “Pacte de Bonne Gouvernance (PBG)” and the 2000 white paper on public
administration reform. The PBG had three main objectives: (i) ethics and moralization of public
administration; (ii)efficiency and efficacy of public administration; and (iii) strengthening the capacity
for coordination and promoting transparency in public affairs. The goal of these efforts was to transform
public administration into an effective and efficient institution able to deliver better services to citizens
and be a driver for private sector development. A number of specific governance and anticorruption
measures were taken and new institutions created. The current Government has outlined a governance
agenda around four pillars: (i)transparency and values in public l i f e and public policy; (ii) efficacy of
public action; (iii) completion of initiatives to strengthen the capacity of key Institutions; and (iv)
improvement of territorial governance.

5 1.
The program aims to increase the role of local government, its performance, accountability,
and empowerment. Since King Mohammed VI’S Royal Address of 12 December 2006 (reinforced on
November 2008) the strengthening of local governments has become central to the government’s agenda.
Among those: (a) the 2007 Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crime Act, and the establishment o f a Financial
Investigation Unit (FIU) in the Office o f the Prime Minister; (b) the 1998 procurement decree which led to significant alignment
with international best practices (its amendment in 2007 has deepened the reform, although additional amendments are yet
needed to assure equivalence to best international practices); (c) a law requiring certain categories o f civil servants and public
officials to disclose their incomes and assets; (d) the creation in 2007 o f an agency for the Prevention o f Corruption (Instance
Centrale de Prevention de la Corruption); (e) the establishment in 2005 o f a new legislative framework for political parties which
has streamlined the rules on the creation o f political parties; (0 substantial improvements made to the legislative framework in
the area o f freedom o f association and assembly that have led to the emergence o f a more active and dynamic civil society; and
(8) the liberalization o f the audio-visual sector with the issuance o f licenses to private operators for radio and TV broadcasting.

19

Enabling the empowerment of the communes represents a strategic change. The 2003 Charte Communale
was further amended in December 2008 to transfer a range o f management responsibilities to the
communes. Strategy formulation at the municipal level has been piloted in Settat and E l Jadida. A recent
initiative provides incentives for communes to develop a Communal Development Plan, to increase
participatory strategic planning at the local level. Government now intends to accelerate the
implementation pace of i t s decentralization program through real decision-making and resource transfers
to local governments, together with adequate deconcentration o f public administration officials. A public
dialogue started with the establishment o f a consultative commission which was tasked to develop a
concept for regionalization. Two pilot regional spatial development plans (for the Tadla-Azilal and
Meknbs-Tafilalet regions), 16 regional agricultural plans identifying a series o f investments in agricultural
development, and two pilot regional development strategies (for the Fbs-Boulmane and the Souss-Massa
regions) have recently been adopted by the regional councils.
Government intends to continue the process of public administration reform. The agenda
52.
seeks to: (i)develop a new results-orientedbudget system with public policy evaluation mechanisms; (ii)
renew efforts to improve public sector governance through enhanced internal and external controls,
auditing, more transparent budget reporting and simplified procedures; (iii)improve the human resource
management framework; (iv) improve the quality o f public services by introducing localized
management, further pursuing the deconcentration process; and (v) simplify administrative procedures
through the development of e-government so as to improve public services and ensuring the integrity and
transparency o f relations between the administration and the user.

E.

Implementation Challenges

Strategy implementation challenges are well recognized.
The 2006 Rapport du
Cinquantenaire noted that the “reform process demonstrates a level of dynamism that needs to be
requires a clear view o f the risks that may
preserved and strengthened”. Consolidating it [...I
compromise its success, such as the lack of synchronization or coherence of the overall reform process;
the incapacity to reach adequate impetus, the risk o f a partial accomplishment of expected objectives; the
non-effectiveness of new laws, which could compromise both the success o f the reforms as well as the
country’s democratic future”. Meeting this challenge requires:

53.

Moving from the “what” to the “how to” o f reforms, with an increased need for coherence
and coordination. To reach its ambitious results, the set o f sector strategies developed will
require structural, cross-cutting actions, likely falling outside the remit of any single agency, such
as fostering public ownership, exercising leadership over major trade-offs, and arbitrating
allocation o f scarce resources.

A clear focus on results, supported by a government-wide emphasis on monitoring and
evaluation. Today not enough i s known about the impact o f social programs or existing sector
strategies, or the nature o f their incidence on beneficiaries. Focusing on results requires a cultural
move from measuring inputs to assessing and managing for results. The new sector strategies’
selection o f measurable targets combined with the on-going public administration reform creates
an opportunity for substantial improvements in the area o f result tracking.
Reduced distance between citizens and the administration. As noted in the Rapport du
Cinquantenaire, decentralization has been on the agenda for decades. Getting better results for
public engagement will require deconcentrating key ministerial agencies, delegating authority
further, pairing the devolution o f financial resources with a parallel transfer of authority,
enhancing the role o f regional, spatial and urban planning, as well as empowering users to play an
active role in accountability mechanisms.

20

Human resources. The quality, allocation and management o f human resources could constrain
strategy implementation in a number o f sectors, particularly education, health and justice.
Regionalization similarly faces local capacity gaps, notably within local elected bodies, which in
turn may provide arguments for retaining control over decisions and resources centrally.
Addressing on-the-job training needs, building capacity, and enhancing both deployment,
recruitment and resource managements functions will be essential.

54.
With clear objectives defined, an ambitious set o f well-articulated sector strategies covering
the next five years, widespread understanding o f cross-cutting constraints, and the experience o f having
managed successfully a first wave o f reform, the country has an opportunity to face up to its
implementation challenges and take a transforming step into its future.

Morocco made impressive progress in a number of the priority areas supported by the
2005-2009 CAS. These included maintaining macro-stability, increasing efficiency of the financial
sector, improving access to finance, and improving water management and access to water and sanitation.
Progress was also made on access to basic education as measured by enrollment rates, efficiency of public
administration, access to all-weather roads in rural areas, improved housing options for the poor, and to a
lesser degree on improving the investment climate. Some new areas of activity were introduced during
CAS implementation, such as energy sector, solid waste, and support for the national human development
initiative. At the same time, some areas in which outcomes were initially targeted did not advance as
anticipated, such as activities in higher education and agro-business development. Table 7 summarizes
the CAS Completion Report’s (CASCR) findings on development outcomes.

56.
The CASCR finds that the four CAS pillars remained valid throughout the period. I t notes
that opportunities arose during implementation to advance CAS objectives through new activities, and
that the Bank Group appropriately adapted to respond to these opportunities. O f the 10 IBRD lending
operations delivered during the period, five were not foreseen when the CAS was discussed by Executive
Directors. The IFC program changed radically from one centered on providing advisory services to one
that included significant equity and debt investments (see Table 8).

The Bank delivered ten lending operations for a total o f $1.127 billion, an average o f $280 million per year. This comprised
six DPLs and four investment projects, with the DPL proportion representing two thirds o f the value o f new commitments.

I F C played an important role during the CAS period through a record investment
program, sizeable advisory activities and i t s entry into local capital markets. From an investment
role previously limited due to the availability o f alternative sources of financing, IFC has now stepped up
its activities and positioned itself as a strategic partner with added value in both its investment and
advisory services. During the CAS period, IFC’s investment increased substantially to reach $272.5
million from $4 million, mostly aligned with CAS Pillar 1 (improve competitiveness and the investment
climate)’.

The principal lessons from the CASCR that can guide future Bank engagement are:

0

The engagement strategy in general, and the results matrix in particular, should have the
flexibility to accommodate inevitable uncertainties over a four year period, specifically to
introduce new activities to respond to shifts in country circumstances and government requests,
and to do less of or discontinue activities that may become relatively less important or less likely
to advance.
Strategic objectives supported by the Bank should have broad national support and, while
selectively engaging with the authorities to analyze and advance often unclear reform choices and

For instance, in FY08 and FY09, IFC committed a record US$255 million in seven projects in multiple sectors, such as
commercial banks, microfinance, wastewater public utilities, investment funds for small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
property development in low income housing and building materials sector.

helping to build consensus, to avoid long-term commitments until a judgment can be made as to
likelihood o f success and comparative advantage.
Individual programming decisions need sufficient flexibility to respond to the outcome o f
dialogue and changed global, regional or national circumstances.
The importance o f building on the progress achieved in allowing IBRD and IFC to work together
as a Bank Group.
Continue coordinated work with development partners, including on joint forward planning.

Consultations

59.
Preparation o f this CPS benefited from an extensive consultation process involving
numerous civil society organizations, youth, academics, the private sector and other donors. Three
objectives structured the consultation approach retained: (i)to discuss the priorities and the role o f the
World Bank in Morocco; (2) to reach out and listen to constituencies with weaker voices; and (iii)to

23

provide depth o f exchanges on sector specific themes. These meetings were characterized by free and
open dialogue and were a rich experience, quite unique for the Middle East and North African region.
The key messages include:

The World Bank Group Program 2009-2013

60.
The objective of the W B G action in Morocco over the next four years is to support
government in the implementation o f its reform program. As discussed above, the government’s
program i s subject to implementation challenges typical o f second generation reforms. This i s the area
where the Bank has been specifically asked to help. Firstly, the WBG w i l l focus on “the how to” of
implementation by facilitating institutional reform and coordination - an area in which Bank’s DPLs have
gained a solid reputation with the client. Secondly, the WBG will seek to maintain its role o f aggregator
and facilitator o f inter-agency coordination by supporting reform implementation in cross-sectoral areas,
through both S I L s and DPLs. Finally, CPS activities will seek to pay particular attention to increasing the
results orientation o f the government’s programs, in line with the findings of the CASCR and in response
to a specific request o f government.

6 1.
The CPS ensures continuity in the WBG’s support to Morocco, as well as opportunities for
scaling up and expanding engagement to new areas. In addition to consolidating the 2005-2009 CAS
Strategic Objectives (Figure 1 l),the CPS builds on the lessons learned from the previous CAS such as
the need to ensure selectivity in Bank Group engagement, to focus on activities where the World Bank
Group can bring value added, and to respond to client’s demand.
62.
The CPS provides a framework which will insure continuity in collaboration and enhance
complementarity between I F C and IBRD. Building on the close collaboration which characterize the
preparation o f the CPS, the IFC and IBRD will jointly support government in i t s private sector
development policies, specifically in the areas o f business environment, trade, competitiveness, financial

24

sector development and public-private partnership. Appendix 2 provides greater details on the WBG’s
private sector approach in the context of the CPS.

The need to respond to the changing conditions of the country context i s ensured by a
flexible and evolving CPS program. The CPS i s built on 19 Program Areas organized within three
thematic pillars (1. Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment; 2. Service Delivery to Citizens;
Sustainable Development in a Changing Climate) and two cross cutting beams (Governance, and
Territoriality). The Program Areas in which engagement has already been fully agreed upon are

Program Areas in which dialogue and programming are still evolving are presented more briefly, and
their related CPS Outcomes will be firmed up at CPS mid-term. This provides a medium term business
plan (24 months) o f firmly developed activities, and a four year framework for program areas where
engagement will be defined. Table 9 presents a breakdown o f program areas by level o f dialogue.
Additionally, two crosscutting beams, Governance and Territoriality, aim to influence the overall WBG
program through a diversity o f operational entry points. “Territoriality” i s a term which i s understood in
Morocco as shorthand for deconcentration, decentralization, regionalization, and spatially-aware
development programs.
64.
I F C will focus on financial and infrastructure sectors, as well as on high value-added
investments in manufacturing, social sectors (health and education) and agribusiness, while
retaining flexibility to adapt to opportunities and changes. IFC’s potential investments in energy,
utilities or ports as well as select investments in Emergence’s sectors, would contribute to Pillar 1 o f the
CPS (growth, competitiveness and employment).
Potential investments in the banking sector,
microfinance and the education sectors would help improve financial and educational services to citizens
(Pillar 2). Finally, the focus on potential investments in renewable energy will contribute to Morocco’s
sustainable development objectives (Pillar 3). IFC will also continue to deliver its on-going advisory
program, in support o f business environment and financial sector reform. I t will retain flexibility to adapt
to change and to respond to new opportunities, as a fbnction o f evolving market conditions and pace of
sector reform.

P I L L A R 1: GROWTH, COMPETITIVENESS, EMPLOYMENT

65.
The structural transformation of the Moroccan economy requires a comprehensive and
coordinated set o f policies in many areas. These include a stable macroeconomic environment; an
improved business environment-including in the area o f infrastructure and in regulatory institutions
that level the playing field; a trade policy that supports the competitiveness o f Moroccan products; a
financial sector that better serves smaller firms; a labor force that i s better trained and effective social
protection and labor market institutions. While progress has been made in all these areas, there i s a strong
need to increase the impact o f reforms and the private sector response. Activities under the first CPS
pillar aim to support government’s objective to enhance Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.
Under this pillar, government has invited the Bank Group to center its program on the seven Program
Areas presented below, o f which the first three are already fully defined, while the remaining five are
under preparation.
Defined Program Areas within Pillar 1

Program Area 1.1: Business Environment
Government Goal: Improve the business environment for all firms, especially for SMEs, via a
comprehensive investment climate reform strategy supported by an effective reform implementation and
coordination process.
CPS Outcomes
1: Streamlined regulatory environment and a more equitable enforcement o f rules, particularly for new

entrants and SMEs
2: More effective reform coordination and implementation in the business environment area.

66.
Morocco’s business environment requires more favorable conditions for new entrants, in
particular for small and medium-sized domestic firms. Government’s support to private sector
development focuses on: (i) reducing the current unpredictability and opaqueness of the legal,
administrative and judicial aspects o f the country’s business environment, which tend to favor well26

established investors; (ii)promoting transparency and accessibility o f laws, regulations, circulars, and
procedures.

67.
Support to government’s program will focus on regulatory reform and institutional
coordination. First, the WBG will facilitate the development of a simplified regulatory environment and
more equitable enforcement o f rules. This will be achieved via technical assistance activities in the areas
o f (i)regulatory streamlining and improved measurement and benchmarking o f the implementation o f
the regulatory framework; (ii)improving the legal framework for corporate governance and minority
shareholder protection, and enhancing transparency of rules and regulations; and (iii)business entry
simplification at one-stop-shops. Second, the WBG will contribute to more effective reform coordination
and implementation in the business environment area. Bank assistance will focus on: (a) helping
government in institutionalizing the new National Commission for Investment Climate Reforms (NCICR)
as an organized, effective and participatory reform platform; and (b) developing consultation
mechanisms, economic impact analysis and monitoring and evaluation tools for preparing projects and
measuring progress o f investment climate reforms. Support will involve technical assistance to the
NCICR, and could possibly involve a lending operation with an investment climate pillar.
68.
IFC’s Advisory Services in M E N A will continue to support business environment
reforms, in close coordination with IBRD. The IFC will focus on areas that require field expertise in
regulatory reform and process reengineering for regulatory simplification. I t will further support the

development of alternative dispute resolutions systems, starting with capacity building of a mediation and
arbitration center in Casablanca. IFC’s support will be selective, reflecting availability o f donor financing
and additionality.

Program Area 1.2: Financial Sector Reform
Government Goal: Improve access to finance by households and SMEs while promoting financial stability
and capital market development through enhanced competition and risk management.
CPS Outcomes
1: A restructured financial sector allowing for sustainable expansion o f access to finance by households
2: Established credit infrastructure conducive to SME finance
3 : Better financial risks identification through the introduction o f independent supervisors
4: Improved liquidity o f the benchmark yield curve to foster capital market development.

69.
Morocco’s financial sector experienced rapid growth in the second half o f the 2000s
following a major reform of the banking sector. Despite progress, important gaps remain. Access
greatly improved (43 percent of Moroccans had bank or postal accounts in 2008, an increase of 9 percent
points since 2005), but remains insufficient. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) played a key role in
providing access to over a million poor people, but their fast growth (four fold in terms o f credit and
doubling in terms o f customers in 2005-2007) stopped in 2008 when their credit portfolio started
deteriorating. The entry o f a few large banks on the SME market improved overall access (credit to SME
increased 40 percent in 2005-2008 and now represents a fifth o f banks’ loan portfolios), but key segments

remain underserved such as those concerning small enterprises and long term finance, and a more difficult
economic environment may jeopardize recent achievements. Furthermore, despite successful efforts to
strengthen the soundness o f systemic institutions, recent growth has generated new financial stability
issues (e.g. asset and liability management, exposures to the real estate sector, linkages within the
financial system). Finally, the potential for growth o f some activities such as long term market finance
has not yet materialized.

70.
The authorities have requested a second Financial Sector DPL to support second generation
reforms. Their four pillar program aims at increasing both breadth and depth, while enhancing
27

financial stability. Government’s first objective i s to foster access to finance for households. In this area,
the Bank will accompany the government’s actions to enhance the viability o f the Microfinance sector building on IFC’s strong program in the sector and the set up o f a postal bank. The second objective i s to
strengthen access to finance for SMEs. Here, the Bank group will contribute to the establishment o f a
strong credit infrastructure (modern credit bureau industry and partial credit guarantee scheme). The third
objective i s to further strengthen financial stability and ensure that financial sector development can be
sustained. To this effect, and building on the existing framework, the Bank will assist the authorities in
the preparation o f new tools to monitor risks and ensure that supervisors have adequate independence to
take action where necessary. The fourth objective i s to foster capital market development. In this area,
Bank support will be geared towards improving the liquidity o f the benchmark yield curve, which will
help harness institutional investors’ potential.

71.
I F C will continue to support government’s goal in the financial sector via its advisory
services as well as through strategic investments in financial institutions, including microfinance
institutions and possibly SME finance instruments. On the investment side, IFC will continue to look
for opportunities to invest in financial institutions that aim at developing low income banking and to
support the emergence o f some banks as regional players. In terms o f advisory activities, technical
support to strengthen the credit information infrastructure will continue to be provided to the central bank
and possibly to specific banks. Other potential advisory activities include capacity building to financial
institutions in risk management, modern SME lending techniques and credit scoring.
Program Area I ,3 Skills and Employment
Government Goal: Achieve a better match between supply and demand o f labor market skills through
improved access to and quality o f higher education and vocational education and training (VET) system,
better labor market information systems and extended active labor market programs.
CPS Outcomes
1 : Better match between labor market needs and higher education and vocational education /training

(VET) schemes
2: M&E system o f labor market policies and programs established
3 : Introduction o f income protection mechanisms to improve labor mobility

72.
Morocco’s labor market i s characterized on the one side by high unemployment among
higher education and VET graduates and on the other by skills shortages in strategic sectors. The
skills mismatch i s due to rigid hiring and firing procedures, high severance payments, and highly taxed
wages, as well as the large proportion o f the labor force which i s poorly educated and employed in lowpaid jobs.
73.
The World Bank Group aims to help government address these challenges through a multisector operation supporting policy reforms in the areas o f higher education, vocational training,
and social protection. I F C could play an complementary investment role. This operation will
include: (i)supporting reforms for improved relevance o f higher education and possibly vocational
education and training to labor market needs; (ii)strengthening labor market M&E systems and
institutions; and (iii)facilitating labor mobility through improved regulations and income protection
mechanisms. Because labor market information i s poor and inadequate to inform policies, an AAA
program i s also envisaged to complement existing analyses. Subject to the adoption of an appropriate
legal framework increasing the creation o f private universities offering accredited diplomas, IFC would
consider potential investments in the education sector.
I

28

Program Areas under development within Pillar 1
Program Area 1.4: Urban Development

74.
I n light of Morocco’s continued and rapid urbanization, government aims to improve the
capacity of cities to respond strategically to challenges, in order for them to withstand the pressures
they will increasingly face. Government has requested the Bank to consider possible support to manage
the urbanization process through actions aimed at: (i) improving the coherence o f municipal projects with
the national land use planning strategy, and the development o f long-term integrated urban area projects;
(ii) fostering the effective application of unified management systems, the establishment o f contractual
agreements and pooling o f resources for implementation o f city projects as well as the rapid adoption of
the new Urban Development Code; (iii)building awareness among the elected representatives as regards
land-related issues,,the modernization of the territorial civil service, management and training o f human
resources and the more systematic involvement o f civil society in development plans; and (iv) supporting
the mobilization of local resources, the identification o f new revenue streams, and an investigation o f the
potential for loans as part o f the overall financing o f urban needs. Finally, the Bank through i t s recently
launched Marseille Center for Mediterranean Integration, will provide TA under the theme “Strategic
Urban Development” focusing on: (a) regional and urban planning; (b) urban land management; (c) urban
expansion and renewal.
Program Area 1.5: Information and Communication Technology

75.
Government i s planning second generation reforms to restore Morocco’s lead in ICT.
Despite the success of the first round o f reforms, significant challenges remain. First, prices in both the
broadband and mobile sectors remain high, limiting access. Second, ICT-based exports remain well
below those o f comparator MICs. Third, Morocco’s immature broadband infrastructure hampers the
development o f domestic software and I T industries. Fourth, Morocco faces an undersupply o f trained I T
workforce. Support to government’s reforms would aim at enhancing ICT competitiveness. Engagement
would take place along two main axes: (i)supporting a new phase o f telecommunicationsand broadband
reform; (ii)enhancing the emergence o f a business process outsourcing - I T enabled services (BPO/ITES)
industry through skills development. Under the first axis the main objectives would be to increase
competition and foster market structure reform through regulatory and institutional reform. To reduce the
skills shortage, the Bank would provide support to the development o f an adequate Curriculum for I T
Skills to accompany the launch o f training courses that match industry needs. The instruments discussed
with government include: a program o f technical assistance in the areas o f e-government and I T
development and continued policy dialogue on telecommunications reform. A new DPL operation could
potentially emerge from this process. The skills development component would be integrated in the new
education and skills development projects.
Program Area 1.6: Justice Sector reform

76.
Justice sector reform i s at the center o f government’s agenda and among the top priorities
for the current legislature Major issues include: (i)poor quality and lack o f transparency o f judicial
decisions; (ii)lack o f qualifications and specialization o f magistrates and auxiliaries o f justice; (iii)long
delays in case management and unreliable enforcement o f court decisions; (iv) uneven access to justice
and to legal and judicial information; and (v) weak budget and human resources management capacity at
the ministry and court levels. A strategy for the reform o f the justice system has not been finalized but it
i s expected to materialize in the coming months. Government has requested Bank support in supporting
the reform of the justice system to improve service delivery to citizens. The Bank i s ready to support
government efforts starting with the finalization o f the strategy through tailored AAA such as topicspecific advisory services, quality o f service delivery surveys, and sharing of international best practice.
29

Once in place, the strategic framework could be supported by a sector DPL to accompany reform
implementation. The IFC will maintain and strengthen its advisory activities supporting the Ministry of
Justice in the area of alternative dispute resolution.
Program Area 1.7: Trade and competitiveness

77.
Government’s trade policy aims to boost growth and job creation by expanding markets for
Moroccan goods and services and transform Morocco into an investment and production platform
for global investors. However, current efforts have not yet led to robust export performance nor
accelerated significantly the structural transformation of the economy. Furthermore, the preferential
stance in trade liberalization i s increasing tariff dispersion leading to trade diversion and providing
incentives for fraud. To address these challenges, Morocco i s reducing trade and investment barriers and
i s pursuing deeper preferential integration. WBG support would focus on six areas: (i) facilitate tariff and
non-tariff reforms on an MFN basis; (ii)facilitate further investment climate reforms to enhance the
capacity of SME to exploit opportunities offered by the global market; (iii) encourage a further reduction
of barriers to trade and investment in services and regulatory convergence with the EU in selected areas
of Morocco’s interest; (iv) support export promotion and (v) enhance the modernization of Morocco’s
innovation system; (vi) improve the performance of trade logistics. Support could be extended through
two main instruments: (a) a CompetitivenessDPL with a substantive trade and integration component; (b)
continued TA to improve technical capacity and the development of new tools to monitor the trade strategy. The
Bank will continue technical support in the areas of trade logistics and trade in agriculture. IFC will consider
potential investments in ports activity or logistical platforms in Morocco with a view to improving the trade
logistics infrastructure and will complement IBRD activities through its advisory support in the business
environment area.
78.
The IFC will continue to focus on developing investment and lending opportunities in
support of the new industrial and agriculture strategies o f Morocco. Morocco’s industrial and
agricultural strategies aim at anchoring the country’s strategy to supporting the emergence of world-class
firms in a select number of sectors where Morocco’s comparative advantages are deemed substantial: (i)
agribusiness; (ii)light automotive and aerospace manufacturing; (iii)fisheries; (iv) business process
outsourcing; (v) electronics; and (vi) industrial “handicrafts”. Modernization of these industries to
become internationally competitive could offer investment opportunities for IFC.
PILLAR 2: SERVICE DELIVERY TO CITIZENS
79.
Reducing social disparities and closing the gap between efforts and results requires a closer
attention to the effectiveness of the public administration and the outcomes of public policies and
investments. Activities under the second CPS pillar aim to support the government’s objective to
enhance access to and quality of service delivery for all citizens. Under this pillar, the Government has
invited the Bank Group to center its program on the eight Program Areas presented below, of which the
first seven are already fully defined, while the remaining one i s still under preparation.
Program Area 2.1: Public Sector Management

Government Goals: Develop an efficient administrationcapable to contribute to enhancing the
competitiveness o f the national economy and the sustainable development o f the country while promoting
investment through the new sectoral strategies and ensuring the medium-term viability o f the
macroeconomic framework.

CPS Outcomes
1 : Multiannual budgetary planning integrated with the process o f preparation of the Budget Law;
2: Key HR policies ready to be adopted : e.g. new standard job classification;
3: The wage bill i s in line with the government medium term target o f 10 percent of GDP;
4: E-government i s introducedto simplify PA procedures including for service delivery.

30

80.
Increasing the efficiency of the public sector i s crucial to the successful implementation o f
the economic and social reforms needed to improve economic performance and achieve sustained
growth. The government i s engaged in an ambitious Public Administration Reform (PAR) program since
2002. The reform aims at ensuring the viability o f the macroeconomic framework by improving the
efficiency o f public expenditure and the optimal allocation of budgetary resources. Support to PAR
remains a key element o f the Bank- government partnership. The Bank has engaged in PAR since its
launch, jointly with the EU and the AFDB. In the future, support to government will firstly focus on the
implementation of a new results-oriented budget system which includes public policy evaluation
mechanisms for enhanced service delivery. Second, the Bank will support activities that will facilitate the
adoption o f new HR policies to improve HR management by: (i) simplifying civil service employment
regulations; (ii)adopting an efficient and transparent remuneration system and (iii) introducing promotion
mechanisms based on merit, competence and probity. Third, the Bank will help improve public wage bill
management in key ministries so as to maintain the current Government medium term target o f a wage
bill at 10 percent of GDP. Finally, the Bank will support the on-going introduction o f e-government to
simplify administrative procedures and to improve public service delivery thus contributing inter alia to
the integrity and transparency of relations between the administration and users. Bank support will
involve a mix o f advisory and lending services centered on the new Public Administration Reform Loan
(the fourth phase o f the Bank's DPL support to Morocco's public administration reform program- PARL
W ) , as well as Programmatic ESWs.
8 1.
Looking forward, a third series o f interventions i s envisaged to support further the next
phases o f reform. The Program Administration Reform agenda will evolve on several dimensions, such
as: (i) finalization of the draft Organic Budget Law (OBL); and .(ii) completion of the deconcentration
strategy and conclusion of preparatory work and subsequent implementation of the current phase o f the
HR reform. The Bank i s prepared to design a new series of lending operations to support the next
Program Administration Reform phase and further strengthen the results orientation o f the program for
enhanced service delivery. In addition, the new series would further reinforce donor harmonization as it
will be developed in full coordination with the next EU and AfDB program.
'rogram Area 2.2: Quality and Access in Education
Government Goal: Achieve universal compulsory basic education by 20 15, promote initiative and
excellence in upper secondary and higher education and improve system performance (teaching,
management and stewardship).
CPS Outcomes
1: Increased net enrollment rates for primary and lower secondary education;
2: Reduced repetition rates for primary and lower secondary education;
3: Improved education quality with a focus on restructuring teachers' training and learning evaluation;
4: Improved management capacity and increased accountability o f results within the context o f

decentralization.

82.
Government aims, via its Education Emergency Plan (EEP) 2009-2012, to ensure that
students leave the formal education system with the knowledge and skills required by the Moroccan
economy and society. The EEP presents a program o f reforms and actions with four strategic objectives:
(i)universalize basic education by 2015; (ii) promote initiative and excellence in secondary and higher
education; (iii)improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship); and (iv) mobilize
the necessary resources. The Bank has been instrumental in forming an innovative consortium o f five
major donors that will support the government's EEP implementation through a set of parallel financing
operations and analytic work, all underpinned by a shared program matrix and a common monitoring
system. The Bank's own Development Policy Lending program will focus on measures that: (i)
rationalize the supply of, and strengthen the demand for, basic education (including pre-school education)

31

through the development and refinement o f planning, targeting and monitoring tools, and (ii)enhance
overall system governance especially at the critical regional level.

’rogram Area 2.3: Health Sector Reform
Government Goal: Reduce the burden of major health conditions, reduce inequity in access to services
affecting poor and rural populations, and improve governance of the sector.
CPS Outcomes
1: Integrated management of non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and treatment at primary
provider level;
2: More comprehensive nutrition activities integrated in the provision o f maternal and child health
services;
3: Increased transparency and equity in budget allocation, and improved capacity o f regions to manage
and deliver services;
4: Good quality and affordable pharmaceuticals are accessible to the population in public health
facil it ies.

83.
Morocco is at the center of a demographic and epidemiological transition. Despite progress
in increasing overall l i f e expectancy, reducing average infant mortality, reducing average fertility rate and
reducing the spread o f communicable diseases, the country faces health challenges. Specifically,
maternal mortality remains high, particularly in rural areas, and major inequalities in health status and in
access to care persist. The Health Action Plan 2008-2012 translates the government’s long term vision
presented in Sante, Vision 2020 (2008) into four operational pillars: (i)revising role and responsibilities
o f the various stakeholders in the health sector; (ii)development o f a care package that i s easily
accessible, adequate in quantity and quality, and well distributed on the territory; (iii)planning and
implementation o f specific national plans for prevention and control o f diseases; and (iv) strengthening o f
health surveillance and hazard management systems.
84.
The Bank will support government’s health reform through a combination of lending and
AAA activities, in coordination with other donors (e.g. EU, AFD, AfDB and Spain). Support will focus
on the following objectives: (i)improve maternal and child nutrition and chronic diseases prevention
through inter alia better prevention, detection and treatment at the primary care level, as well as
communication; (ii) facilitate the regionalizatioddecentralization o f health services through the
establishment o f Etablissements Publics de Sank!; and (iii)reform o f the pharmaceutical sector to
improve drug availability and reduce costs through the establishment o f the national pharmaceutical
agency. In addition, the Bank w i l l support the transversal governance pillar o f the Health Action Plan
2008-20 12 including budget preparation and execution processes, financial and human resource
allocation, health management information systems, and the implementation o f systems fostering better
accountability.
Government Goal: Reduce poverty, social exclusion and vulnerability by empowering poor and
vulnerable groups and particularly women and youth.

CPS Outcomes
1: Improved access to basic infrastructure, social services and economic opportunities by poor and
vulnerable groups, including women and youth;
2: Sustainable and improved quality of services to vulnerable groups;
3: Better coordination of national policies and institutional mechanisms to reduce vulnerability;
4: Consolidation o f participatory approaches to ensure that basic infrastructure and socio economic
services with the needs o f the poor and vulnerable groups, including women and youth.

32

vulnerability. INDH relies on bottom up participation and planning to improve living standards and give
greater voice to the poor in targeted communities. The program also aims to promote better coordination
of poverty alleviation policies and implementation mechanism across government agencies. Expected
outcomes include: (i) reduction of poverty, social exclusion and vulnerability; (ii)consolidation of the
participatory approaches to local service delivery planning; and (iii) improvement of the access to basic
infrastructure, social services and economic activities by poor and vulnerable groups. The Bank will
continue its support to INDH, focusing in particular on (a) consolidation o f participatory approaches for
bottom up planning of interventions; (b) supporting increased access to basic infrastructure service
delivery, basic infrastructure and economic activities; and (c) facilitating interagency coordination of
policies and interventions. The Bank will consider supporting the second phase of INDH, currently
planned for the period 201 1-2015 based on a thorough evaluation of the experience to date and the
proposed way forward. Specific support to the Government’s youth and gender agenda will continue
through dedicated analytical work. One AAA activity i s under implementation on youth inclusion with
the following objectives: (i) identify the key factors leading to the social and economic exclusion of
young people aged 15 to 29 years; (ii) support the national youth strategy that i s currently being
formulated by the Ministry of Youth and Sports; and (iii) provide an investment roadmap for youth
inclusion in a variety of dimensions across sectors. Regarding gender, analytical activities would be
developed in line with government’s demand. These could take the form of TAs in relevant sectors, or
pilot interventions based on sound analytic work. For example, the positive experience in supporting
gender budgeting could be continued in the coming years; the data effort associated with the youth AAA
can lend itself to specific analytical work on gender issues that would inform sector strategies or specific
programs as appropriate.
Program Area 2.5: Transport
Government Goals: Increasethe rural population’s access to all-weather roads and improve urban transport
by reducing congestion.
CPS Outcomes

1: Increased accessibility o f rural population to all-weather roads - from 65% (2009) to 80% (2012);
2 : Sustainable maintenance o f unclassified roads;
3: Efficient planning and management o f the urban transport sector;
4: Financial support allocated to urban transport projects with high economic returns.

86.
Improving access of rural dwellers to basic transport infrastructure i s among the key goals
of the government’s 2020 Rural Development Strategy. The first National Program of Rural Roads
(NPRR-1) was launched in 1995 and finished in 2006, with impressive results: over 11,000 kilometers of
unpaved roads were rehabilitated, with proven positive repercussions on the net enrollment ratio of girls
in primary school and the price of some staple foods. Following the positive experience with NPRR-1,
government requested Bank support to NRRP-2, which aims to expand access to an all-weather road by
relying on a strong participatory process, vertical coordination among government levels, and a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system. The Bank, with other donors, i s co-financing the
NRRP-2 whose overall estimated cost i s US$l.8 billion. Given the satisfactory progress of the program,
the government requested an additional financing. Through i t s support to the NPRR, the Bank i s
contributing, together with the government and a number of other donors, to the gradual extension of the
rural network coverage to increase rural populations’ access to all-weather roads. In addition, the Bank
and other donors are supporting the government to ensure sustainable maintenance of the unclassified
rural roads by facilitating the setting up of an agreement between the local communities, the Ministry of
Interior and the Ministry of Equipment to ensure that maintenance i s carried out and i s appropriately
funded.
87.
Government i s also engaged in addressing emerging problems in urban transport. With the
growth of cities and rapid development of motorization, urban transport has become a severe problem and

33

its improvement i s a priority for local governments.
Increasing congestion i s affecting the
competitiveness o f cities and the population’s access to jobs and services. Since 2006, the WBG has
supported the government’s efforts at improving the efficiency o f urban transport in the country’s large
cities. An extensive AAA program has allowed the Government and the Bank to jointly identify key
issues and formulate the main strategic reforms needed to address these issues. government has requested
Bank support to the design and implementation o f urban transport reforms through a series o f
development policy loans. The focus will be on: (i)improving the planning and management o f the
sector and, (ii)developing systems and incentives so that public and private resources flow to investments
and activities with the highest social and economic returns. More specifically the proposed Urban
Transport DPLs would contribute to: (a) reduce transport costs and improve the mobility o f people and
goods, therefore improving the cities’ competitiveness, and creating the proper framework for follow up
employment and growth stimulating investments; (b) improve the quality and efficiency of urban
transport services; and (c) improve sustainable development by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The
proposed DPLs would also contribute to reinforcing important cross cutting themes such as regional
development, governance, and public private partnerships.

Program Area 2.6: Agricultural Sector Reform
Government Goal: Increasedcompetitiveness and diversification o f the agricultural sector to sustain
stronger agricultural growth and employment.
CPS Outcomes
1: Improved integration o f smallholders into domestic markets;
2: Improved irrigation water management;
3: Improved public sector support and services to smallholders.

88.
Government recently launched the Plan Muroc Vert (PMV), an ambitious agricultural
reform program. The PMV aims to turn agriculture into a source o f growth and employment creation.

Investments will aim at increasing productivity, improving food security, and encouraging climate change
adaptation. The PMV’s two pillars (the first focused on developing high added value commercial
agriculture and the second on increasing incomes o f smallholder farms) will be supported by institutional
reforms aimed at creating an enabling business environment. The Bank will help government to: (i)
improve integration o f smallholders into domestic markets, by piloting public private partnerships in the
construction and management o f municipal agricultural and animal markets, slaughterhouses, and fresh
fruit and vegetable markets; (ii)improve irrigation water management, by facilitating the delegation o f
irrigation management responsibilities to private operators, implementing the National Irrigation Water
Management Program, and enhancing coordination among government stakeholders; (iii)improve public
sector support and services to smallholders by introducing transparent, competitive, and participatory
procedures in the identification and implementation o f PMV pillar I1 projects. In supporting
government’s agricultural reform agenda, the Bank will particularly aim to:
a) Improve integration o f smallholders into domestic markets, by piloting public private partnerships in
the construction and management o f municipal animal markets, slaughterhouses, and fresh fruit and
vegetable markets, with a view to improve access o f smallholders to quality market infrastructure,
improve price formation, as well as enhance the overall safety and quality o f domestically marketed
food;
b) Improve irrigation water management, by facilitating the delegation of irrigation management
responsibilities o f the Public Agricultural Development Agencies (ORMVA’s) to private operators,
implementing the National Irrigation Water Management Program, and enhancing coordination
among government stakeholders. More efficient use o f irrigation water will additionally be
encouraged through improved water pricing and irrigation management, and enforcement o f controls
on ground water extraction;

34

c)

Improve public sector support and services to smallholders by introducing transparent, competitive,
and participatory procedures in the identification and implementation o f PMV pillar I1 projects, in
line with the recent reforms undertaken by government to regionalize and streamline the delivery o f
agricultural services.

Program Area 2.7: Social Protection Reform
Government Goal: Design and implement a more equitable, efficient and coherent package o f social
protection programs and reform the oil and food subsidies programs.
CPS Outcomes
1:A more coherent, equitable, and sustainable supply o f social protection programs for poor and

vulnerable groups;

2: More efficient and effective social protection operational systems, including targeting and M&E;
3 : Expansion and diversification o f social security coverage.

89.
Government has intensified its efforts at building efficient social safety nets and social
insurance schemes in the past years but the system still faces important challenges. These include
the need to increase coverage, improve targeting, increase the adequacy of interventions to the needs o f
the poor and vulnerable, and strengthen coordination at both central and local levels. Government i s also
trying to progressively reduce the predominance o f untargeted oil and food subsidies as the main safety
net, and to develop targeted social assistance programs promoting the insertion o f poor and vulnerable
groups in the economy. Following the exchange o f international experience on oil and food subsidy
reforms in 2008, government has requested the Bank’s help with social protection reform. Bank support
will focus on the design and implementation of a more equitable, coherent and sustainable package o f
social assistance and social insurance programs. This will be achieved through the completion of the
ongoing Targeting and Social Protection Strategy, and a mix o f lending and complementary AAA to
facilitate the implementation o f its recommendations. The strategy under preparation analyzes: (i)the
match between the needs for and supply o f social assistance and social insurance programs with a view to
identify gaps and overlaps; (ii)targeting systems; and (iii) the institutional framework for social
protection. The analysis may lead to scaling up promising programs or setting up new ones which will
require stronger systems and processes (e.g. targeting, beneficiary registry management & maintenance,
payment systems, M&E, communication,). In parallel, the Bank will continue to provide TA on social
security expansion and diversification, and may initiate AAA where critical program gaps are being
identified under the ongoing work such as Early Childhood Development.
Program Areas under development within Pillar 2
Program Area 2.8: Leveraging PPPs for

infrastructure investments and service delivery

90.
Public Private Partnerships represent an opportunity to enhance the effectiveness o f
government’s future investments i n infrastructure and service delivery. Morocco has developed
valuable experience in PPPs during the past decade. Yet, use o f PPPs remains ad hoc, lacking a strategic
vision and constrained by a number of shortcomings. Government can significantly benefit from
additional usage o f PPP, given the country’s substantial infrastructure needs, its need to maintain fiscal
balance, and the potential efficiency gains involved. World Bank Group support to PPP initiatives could
be either sector-specific, via a component o f an investment lending operation or a AAA activity (in the
infrastructure sectors for example), or crosscutting and focused on helping the government address the
PPP agenda at institutional level, for instance through TA support to a new central PPP unit.
91.
The growth o f PPP transactions in Morocco offers opportunities for IFC to play a role
either as an investor in specific project, o r as an advisor. In the energy sector, the anticipated
liberalization o f the power sector and in particular, plans for independent power generation and renewable
35

energy could present key opportunities for IFC. In the transport sector, opportunities are also likely to
arise from the large government-led infrastructure projects such as the Tangier Med Port or from urban
transport projects for large cities such as Rabat or Casablanca. In the area of solid waste management
where recent reforms open new opportunities for the private sector, the IFC could support PPPs in new
waste management plants, at the municipal level.

PILLAR 3: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN A CHANGING C L I M A T E

92.
Morocco’s future economic development i s vulnerable to energy supply disruption and
price volatility, water scarcity and natural resource depletion. Climate change impacts are already
felt today. Activities under the third CPS Pillar aim to support government’s renewed attention to long

standing environmental sustainability issues and future challenges brought about by climate change.
Government has solicited the Bank’s support
on four program areas, of which one i s currently under
..
development.
Defined Program Areas

Program Area 3.1: Water Management
Government Goal: Promote water resources conservation and protection and improve water service
coverage and efficiency.
CPS Outcomes
1 : Reduced water losses and better control o f groundwater abstraction;
2: Increased urban sewerage and wastewater treatment coverage;
3: Better knowledge o f CC impacts on water resources;
4: Increased access to and efficiency o f WSS services;
5: Better coordination between ministries involved in the water sector.

93,

Government recently launched its new water sector strategy. Although its details remain
unpublished, it i s announced to focus on: (i)accelerated investment in development o f conventional and
alternative water resources; (ii)new policy emphasis on demand management and water savings in
irrigation and utility service; (iii)continued support to resource protection and wastewater management
programs; (iv) development o f flood control works; and (v) institutional reforms. In the water supply and
sanitation (WSS) subsector, government remains committed to achieve equitable WSS access in rural and
periurban areas, upgraded urban sanitation services and increased utility service efficiency.

94.
Building on the gains and lessons of a substantial water program under the 2005-2009 CAS,
the 2010-2014 CPS will seek to strengthen the Bank- government partnership in the water sector. It
will maximize the cross-cutting contribution o f water to Morocco’s economic growth, social
development, and climate change adaptation needs. The diversity, complexity and evolution of water
challenges across the water resources management, irrigation, and water supply and sanitation subsectors,
call for a flexible and strategically targeted application o f Bank instruments. Policy and investment
lending appear most relevant in subsectors such as irrigation and WSS with clear impacts on the
economic growth, social development, and water demand management agendas. Policy reform and
investment needs in water resources management, including strategy optimization in light of climate
change impacts, may best be addressed through policy lending, TA and ESWs, as well as through selected
investments in resource development.
95.
Accompanying the government’s efforts in promoting PPPs in the water sector, I F C will
consider opportunities in water and sanitation concessions in new cities or in desalination projects.
Investment in the water and sanitation sectors might also offer opportunities for IFC subnational lending,
36

along the lines o f its investment in a sanitation project in a local utility in the city o f El Jadida in FY08.
Finally, it could also provide advisory support in specific PPP transactions as it successfully did in the
irrigation sector, in the Guerdane region.
’rogram Area 3.2: Low Carbon Energy Policy and Energy Sector Restructuring
Government Goal: Enhance energy security and ensure availability o f energy to all Moroccan

households and businesses at competitive prices, while protecting the environment and mitigating
climate change.

CPS Outcomes
1 : Reduction o f energy intensity and increased penetration o f renewables to transition the energy system
to a low carbon path;
2 : Price reform implementation, to reduce the budget burden o f price subsidies and ensure the financial
viability of energy operators;
3: Establishment o f institutions and financial mechanisms to successhlly implement energy sector
reform;
4: Development o f a local manufacturing capability for renewable technologies and energy efficient
equipment-a green stimulus package-therefore contributing to job creation.

96.
T o address the challenges o f energy security, sustainable development and competitiveness,
government formulated a new strategy in 2009. The objectives are: energy security, availability of
energy to all Moroccan households and businesses at competitive prices, energy demand management,
promotion of national expertise and development o f technological know-how and environmental
protection and climate change mitigation. To achieve these objectives, the key elements o f the strategy
are: (i)diversify and optimize the energy mix around reliable and competitive energy technologies, in
order to reduce the share o f oil to 40% by 2030; (ii)develop the national renewable energy potential, with
the objectives o f increasing the contribution o f renewables to 10-15% o f primary energy demand by 2012;
(iii)make energy efficiency improvements a national priority; (iv) develop indigenous energy resources
by intensifying hydrocarbon exploration activities and developing conventional and non-conventional oil
sources; (v) integrate into the regional energy market, through enhanced cooperation and trade with both
other Maghreb countries and the EU.

97.
Government has requested Bank lending to help address these challenges and make the
energy sector an engine of sustainable growth and competitiveness. To address the objectives of
energy security, competitive energy supplies and low carbon intensity, it i s essential to improve the
operational and financial performance o f the sector and strengthen its governance. To that end, the CPS
will support actions in a number of areas: (i)energy efficiency and renewable energy (“maitrise de
l’e‘nergie’’); (ii)technology promotion for local use and exports, with a view to improving domestic
environmental sustainability and increased performance o f the national economy but also help
government contribute to global climate change mitigation; (iii)sound operational and financial
performance o f the energy sector; (iv) management o f energy price subsidies, so as not to burden the
economy, while at the same time not penalizing the most vulnerable populations (through targeted
subsidies); (v) governance o f the energy sector, to enable the necessary institutional and sector reforms to
improve sector performance.
98.
IBRD will support these outcomes through a mix o f instruments. First, a DPL built on three
pillars: (i) security o f supply, while ensuring a sustainable energy future, (ii) competitiveness o f energy
supplies and (iii) capacity building for strong operational and financial performance. Second, investment
lending and credit lines are being provided to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, as part o f
the investment plan recently approved by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) to access concessional
resources for low carbon investment. This will help improve energy efficiency in all end-use sectors industry, buildings and transport, including railways - and increase the penetration of renewable energy in

37

the power sector. Third, a GEF grant supports the construction o f a solar assisted combined cycle power
plant in the North east o f the country. Fourth, the concentrated solar power scale-up initiative calls for
use o f CTF financing for the large scale development o f solar based power generating capacity. Morocco
plays a key role in the development o f the vast untapped Maghreb solar potential. The Bank w i l l also
finance essential basic infrastructure necessary to exploit the region’s solar resources: transmission within

the country or cross-border, storage (for instance thanks to pumped storage) and other required
transmission and balancing investment. Finally, the Bank w i l l support regional integration, in particular
the construction o f the Maghreb common energy market and the integration into the EU market (in
particular through exports o f green electricity).

99.
IFC will pursue investments in viable renewable energy projects. It will support investments
in privately sponsored wind generation plants and w i l l also consider investments i n solar generation

projects.

Box 1: Concentrated solar power in Morocco - A Bank-Government partnership for energy security,
sustainability and growth
Renewable energy (RE) i s central to the energy dialogue between the World Bank Group and the government o f
Morocco. Examples include the Bank-financed low-carbon energy supply strategy, the development of the
contractual framework for wind self-generation, the GEF grant for the Ain Beni Mathar integrated solar combined
cycle power plant, the various provisions contained in the Energy DPL for a law on RE, an implementationplan for
wind power promotion, and price reform to promote energy efficiency (EE) and RE. The CPS will support
government’s objective to enhance the role of the energy sector as an engine of equitable growth, while ensuring
sustainability.

On November 2nd 2009, a US$9 billion solar plan was announced that aims to install 2,000 M W of solar power
generation capacity by 2020. With this plan, the equivalent o f Casablanca’s electricity consumption - 4,500 GWh
annually - w i l l be produced from Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). This ambitious goal requires transformation o f
the energy sector and has economy-wide implications. It will orient industrial development and the research
community (e.g., through publicly-financedresearch centers) towards RE. I t will foster low-carbon development of
the energy sector and enhance energy security. I t will stimulate large investments, enhance Morocco’s
competitiveness and define it as an ‘early mover’ on a promising green technology. Both construction and operation
o f the projects would provide major employment opportunities.
The Bank will support Morocco’s solar plan through the Energy DPL, concessional financing proposed through the
Clean Technology Fund, and possible investment lending operations and technical assistance. I t could also serve as
a ‘pilot’ for the PPP work envisaged by the Moroccan government together with both the World Bank and the IFC.
I t i s intended that CSP projects currently planned will be privately owned and operated. The scale of the initiative
requires public support, concessional financing from donors, and implementation o f an enabling regulatory and
institutional framework to make CSP competitive enough to attract private investment. If Morocco succeeds in
combining the CSP know-how with the right domestic regulatory environment, RE has the potential to export large
amounts of CSP-power to Europe and to become a major long-term driver of green growth in Morocco. The PPP
approach, to be tested in this CPS, offers promise in making this happen.

Program Area 3.3: Solid Waste Management

I Government Goals: (i)effective establishment of integrated municipal solid waste systems based on a I
sound legal and institutional basis; (ii)enhanced sustainability through the introduction of financial
mechanisms and incentives; (iii)improve the environmental and social performance o f the solid waste
sector through the upgrading and operationalizationo f the existing EIA system.
CPS Outcomes
1: Effective inter-ministerial coordination of the National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and
strengthened regulatory framework through the enactment of executive regulations for Solid Waste
Management (SWM) planning, norms and standards

2: Better financial sustainability through: (i) allocation o f financial resources consistent with the sector
policies and programs; (ii) improved cost effectiveness o f private sector operators involved in
providing SWM services; (iii)additional sources o f revenues generated through Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM);
3: Disposal practices complying with international social and environmental standards, by establishment
o f an Environmental Impact Assessment system.

100. Morocco’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Management Sector faces major performance
constraints. These include: (i)poor waste disposal practices with huge environmental and social
negative impacts; (ii) domestic M S W production increasing exponentially; (iii) a weak legal and
institutional framework; (iv) poor cost effectiveness o f services; with weak long-term financial
sustainability; (v) urgent need for integrated and modernized solid waste management systems, which will
mitigate negative economic, environmental, and social impacts o f the existing systems; and (vi) limited
and inefficient allocation o f financial resources and missed opportunities available under international
climate change mechanisms.
101, The Bank will support government in the key steps taken towards reform o f the S W M
system. After the passing o f the Solid Waste Management Law 28-00 in November 2006, government
launched a 15-year, 3-phase National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program to restructure and
modernize the sector. Firstly, the Bank will support the Government objectives o f putting the sector on a
sound institutional footing by supporting effective interministerial coordination and a strengthened
regulatory framework. Secondly, the Bank will support financial sustainability by ensuring that financial
allocations are consistent with the program objectives, by devising measures to enhance the cost
effectiveness o f private sector operators and making sure that additional sources o f C D M revenues are
leveraged. Thirdly, the Bank w i l l help government in ameliorating the environmental and social
performance o f the sector, by upgrading the EIA system and ensuring that environmental and social
constraints are considered at various stages o f the decision chain.
Program Areas under Development

Program Area 3.4: Climate Change
Government Goal: Improve resilience to climate variability and change through the integration of
adaptation actions across and within sectors and explore new avenues for mitigation.
CPS Outcomes
1 : Improved inter-agency coordination and policy coherence on climate change;
2: Defined adaptation and mitigation planning in key sectors;
3: Adaptation pilots launched in selected areas;
4: Development o f tools and mechanisms to increase resilience and alertness.

102. Government intends to strengthen the country’s ability to cope with current and future
climatic variability and longer-term change, while at the same time lowering emissions. There i s
increased awareness o f climatic vulnerability and interest in opportunities offered by low carbon growth.
The National Climate Change Council and the National Scientific Committee for Climate Change are
increasingly active. A number o f recent sector strategies attempt to address climate change implications,
such as the new agriculture strategy, Plan Maroc Vert. I t focuses on efficiency in the use o f water, as
sustainability o f water resources i s a national priority. Mitigation efforts are already under way in the
energy and solid waste sectors. The transport, urban, and agriculture sectors are identifying further
prospects. A consolidated strategy i s needed to resolve the trade-offs posed to public policy.
103. Government has requested the Bank’s support to address climate change. First, building on
Morocco’s second national communication to the UNFCCC, the Bank will support the preparation o f an
39

integrated adaptation and mitigation strategy. Second, the Bank will contribute to adaptation and
mitigation planning through ESW in areas such as integrated risk management, coastal cities adaptation,
transport (both mitigation and adaptation), integrated coastal zone management and climate-induced
migration. Third, the Bank will support the design and implementation of adaptation pilots, for instance
in the agricultural sector, combining investment, policy lending, ESW and GEF resources. Fourth, the
Bank will support the development of climate information tools and analysis, to help build the knowledge
base required to inform policy. Going forward, the Bank will remain open to increase i t s support to
Morocco’s adaptation and mitigation needs and investments across all sectors.

CPS - Crosscutting Beams: Governance and Territoriality
Governance
104. The W B G will support the government’s governance approach and program. Government’s
ambitious development outcomes require addressing critical governance issues, such as low internal and
external accountability on results, and lack of sufficient feed-back loop on the incidence of public
expenditure. It has been agreed with government that governance i s therefore a crosscutting theme
affecting engagement in the entire Bank program. Entry points for governance work will be assessed at
the concept stage of all instruments. The Bank will seek to maximize value for money in public
expenditure and improve the delivery of public services. The C-GAC analysis completed in 2009
provided Bank teams with a platform to identify such entry points. Specific attention will be devoted to
efficiency gains to maximize the impact of public spending in the delivery of key services particularly in
health, education, water and sanitation and social protection, and to strengthen the institutional framework
in selected sectors.
105.
The Bank will support institutional development at the national and local levels. The public
administration reform DPL will support budgetary and HR efficiency. The Solid Waste and Urban
Transport DPLs aim to support more effective regulatory frameworks, as do engagements in the water
and energy sectors. The Bank will help strengthen the new National commission for investment climate
reforms. Dialogue on urban development aims at improving the institutional coherence of municipal
projects and to align them with the national land use planning strategy.

106.
Improved public expenditure will be pursued through capacity to measure results and
orient service delivery to outcomes.’ IBRD i s contributing to the development of more efficient and
I t supports the
effective social protection operational systems, including targeting and M&E.
government’s Education Emergency Plan (2009-20 12) to focus on improved education quality by
restructuring teachers’ training and learning evaluation and increasing management capacity to account
for results. It i s conducting a user survey on health sector facilities and services. The Skills Development
DPL will support government to establish an M&E system on labor market policies and programs. The
Bank will develop tools for economic impact analysis and monitoring and evaluation for measuring
progress of investment climate reforms. The Bank will consider accompanying other initiatives, such as
helping to pilot the use of new accountability tools and supporting key governance institutions. This
could be done through non lending support to the new anti-corruption agency (Instance Centrale de
Pre‘vention de la Corruption, ICPC), MIS capacity building to enable easy access to development
outcomes information (key service delivery statistics, results/achievements) by citizens, particularly in
social sector, and piloting the use of citizen’s report cards and users’ surveys. Finally, the Bank’s
commitment to increase the use of country systems in the delivery of i t s program also constitutes an
opportunity to improve institutional performance in a range o f public financial management, procurement,
social and environmental areas.
40

Territoriality

107. The Bank will support the government’s objective to foster spatially inclusive development,
and to increase the role o f local government, i t s performance, accountability, and empowerment.
First, effective spatially inclusive development programs, such as those aimed at facilitating the
integration o f lagging areas with growth-pole regions, require the establishment and development o f
institutions and policies that respond to local needs and demands. Government’s spatial development
agenda aims at a better regulation of land, labor, and product markets; the provision o f quality basic social
services; and investments in connecting infrastructure through territorial-based interventions. Second,
achieving these results depends on a further definition o f roles and responsibilities o f the central and subnational governments and a stronger link between the envisaged deconcentration and decentralization
reforms. Improved capacity and accountability mechanisms at the sub-national level, and an appropriate
distribution o f fiscal and human resources are then required. The Bank will seek to further discuss the
choices and implications of a greater reliance on levels below central government in order to support a
vision of “territoriality” and use the Bank program to support its realization.
108. Numerous entry points exist and provide a foundation for further support. The PAR Loan
and its related ESW address some of the challenges o f the deconcentration agenda, such as reforming HR
and budget policies. The Solid Waste Management DPLs support devolved decision-making authority
and management functions to the communes, together with increased financial capacity and authority.
Bank financial support for implementation of the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV) will help readjust the balance
between central and local level decision making in the agricultural sector. Lending and AAA activities
support increased transparency, efficiency and equity in budget allocation, and improved capacity o f
regions to manage and deliver services in the health sector. The Bank supports increased local capacities
and better coordination o f national policies and institutional mechanisms in the National Initiative on
Human Development (INDH). Other examples include rural roads and various operations (urban
transport and solid waste) to facilitate direct private sector contracting by the communes. Going forward,
the Bank will broaden the dialogue through additional AAA products and will consider requests for
financial support for the second half o f the CPS program period.
D.

Lending Volumes

109. Government has requested an annual IBRD lending envelope of US$600 million which i s
more than twice the average annual lending volume during the FY06-FYOg CAS period. The
interest to borrow more from the Bank reflects both a wish to benefit from Bank support on an expanded
reform agenda and a debt restructuring strategy that would see a greater proportion o f external financing
on favorable terms. Three main factors underpin the strategy to increase the proportion o f multilateral
financing. The first i s linked to the public debt maturity structure. The average maturity has fallen in
recent years, and i s expected to fall further given that the central government mostly financed its needs
through issuing T-bills o f up to one year in the domestic market. The authorities therefore wish to
lengthen average maturity. The second relates to the higher balance o f payments needs. The third i s to
accommodate the current higher borrowing requirements from the budget in a context of tightening
liquidity o f the domestic financial markets after a long period of an over-liquid money market.
1 10. The Government’s reform agenda i s reflected in a strong pipeline o f operations for the next
two fiscal years. Table 10 below shows a tentative lending program o f $600 million in each year. Most

operations listed for FY 10 are in the final phases of preparation. The operations listed for FY 11 have
been the subject o f a formal request by the government, and are currently under preparation. Current
indications are that this level o f demand will continue beyond FY 11, A l l operations are intended to
support the most critical reform programs, with a particular focus on the six priority sectors identified, as
well as the transversal themes o f governance, territoriality, and public administration reform.

11 1. The proposed FYlO IBRD lending envelope o f $600 million i s confirmed. Around half i s
expected to be in the form of development policy lending. The lending envelope for FY 1 1 and beyond i s
indicative at this stage and i s conditional on IBRD’s overall lending capacity.
E.

Principles and Rules of Engagement

1 12. I n Morocco’s rapidly evolving reform environment, a client owned program requires
flexibility. During the last programming cycle, the Bank avoided straitjacketing i t s action within the rigid
contours of the CAS program to effectively address the country’s shifting needs and remain relevant.
This CPS addresses the issue directly by developing a clear medium term business plan (24 months) of
defined operations, while maintaining leeway to adjust the program based on the results of dialogue in the
remaining program period. Equally, the Results Matrix shies away from specifying outcomes and
indicators for operations that are currently under development. The midterm CPS review will provide the
opportunity to do so while developing the definitive .business plan for the second half of the program.

113. Ensuring a flexible and client owned program will also require particular attention to
selectivity issues. To maintain a focus on the Bank’s mandate, while ensuring client ownership, future
interventions will have to go through a simple three-question test: (i) I s there a need? (ii)I s there a clear
government demand? (iii) Does the Bank have a comparative advantage in bringing or brokering
capacity? If the answer to any of these questions i s “no”, then there will be a case for staying out.
F.

Instruments

1 14. CPS implementation will be supported by the full range o f IBRD instruments. The choice of
instruments will be determined by three criteria: status of dialogue, demand from the government, and
the characteristics of the specific operation.
1 15. DPLs have so far been central to the lending program, reflecting the reform nature o f
engagement. O f the ten lending operations delivered during the previous CAS (2005-2009) for a total of
$1.127 billion, six were DPLs, representingtwo thirds of commitments. The DPLs supported sector-wide
structural reforms with substantial development impact in areas such as: (i)increased efficiency of public
administration; (ii)increased efficiency of the financial sector and improved access to finance; (iii)
42

enhanced energy security, increased energy efficiency, and an improved framework for renewable
energies development; (iv) increased access to low-income housing; (v) improved water management
and increased access to drinking water and sanitation services; and (vi) more efficient and safer nationwide management o f solid waste. The reform content o f Bank-financed S I L s and SWAps has also been
substantial, as in the education sector and the National Initiative for Human Development. DPLs are the
preferred instrument o f the Government. In addition to providing flexibility, they provide an adequate
conduit for the kind o f structural challenges that sector-wide reforms entail. If necessary, the Bank will
consider increasing the volumes o f i t s DPLs to respond to these preferences in line with the nature o f the
proposed program. To the extent possible, the Bank will consolidate DPL interventions based on
synergies and sector compatibility.

116. The Morocco portfolio has seen significant changes in recent years. As the Bank has
responded to government’s preference for the DPL instrument, the investment lending portfolio has
declined considerably in number o f projects from 14 in FY07 to 6 today. The aggregate size o f the
portfolio has remained relatively large as the program i s consolidated into fewer but larger-size projects.
The portfolio amounts to $433.7 million in commitments, o f which $237.8 million i s undisbursed. The
performance of the portfolio has been strong with one unsatisfactory project (currently being restructured)
that accounts for just 6% o f overall commitments. Portfolio performance indicators on realism,
proactivity and disbursement are all good. Looking forward, government has requested the Bank to
develop further investment projects in the coming two years in rural roads and water and sanitation.
These are sectors where the implementation track has been strong.
I 1 7. The Bank has a large trust fund program. I t supports 36 discrete activities in the aggregate
amount of $64 million, in ten sectors aligned with government priorities. It i s guided by the principles of
country ownership, alignment with CPS objectives, being complementary to other Bank activities, broad
dissemination o f findings, and selectivity in deployment. It i s mainly focused on analytic work, much o f
which i s linked to policy-based lending. Key areas supported are public sector management, energy,
water, education (innovative testing of Conditional Cash Transfer pilots) and climate change. Appendix 7
provides more details on the role of trust funds in the program.
1 1 8. The Bank’s role as knowledge partner in Morocco will depend both on maintaining the
quality of its AAA products as well as alignment with demand. ESW will continue to play a particular
role in increasing awareness as in the analytical work program proposed on poverty, youth and gender. I t
will also be deployed to build consensus on how to approach important challenges, as in social protection,
economic integration, business environment, agriculture and climate change. AAA products will also be
developed to support large and complex operational engagements as in public sector reform, enhanced
service delivery, water and energy.

1 19.

Analytical products will provide the starting point o f engagement in areas where dialogue i s
recent. This includes areas such as public-private partnerships, areas where there i s uncertainty about the
impact o f a first generation reform or where there are reputational risks o f engagement through financial
support. However, in order to enhance its knowledge leverage, the Bank will need to consolidate the
ESW portfolio to make it less fragmented, and reflect on its approach to mobilizing trust fund support,
with a view to align it on client’s demand.

120. One key challenge i s to increase capacity for monitoring and evaluation to deliver
increasingly complex policies, ensure the reduction of social disparities and reduce lower exposure
to risk. In the context o f increasing decentralizationo f decision making and implementation and the need
to build capacity across key agencies the Bank will concentrate on assisting Morocco overcome key gaps
in the data on economic vulnerability and the impact o f risks on living standards. The value added of

43

Bank involvement i s to improve quality o f nationally-owned capacity, facilitate better coordination in a
decentralized system o f data collection and evaluation, and support greater openness and participation o f
civil society.

12 1. I F C will focus on investments with demonstrated additionality and strong development
impact. This will include for instance large financing needs, exceeding the capacity o f domestic banks,
or those requiring longer maturities, foreign currency financing or complex structuring that are not
available locally. Through the use o f equity, quasi-equity and structured finance products such as
guarantees, IFC will also consider smaller investments in strategic sectors (e.g. agribusiness, education
and health sectors, wind projects) where it can add value. IFC’s advisory program will continue to
complement investments, with activities focused on the business climate and PPP advisory-based
transactions in infrastructure.
122. MIGA’s stands ready to support pillars I and I 1 of the CPS. First, building on
trade liberalization and increasing trends o f Moroccan direct investments abroad, MIGA stands ready to
accompany private sector competitiveness, by supporting the international development of Moroccan
enterprises mainly into sub-Saharan Africa. Second, MIGA could support government’s efforts to
improve the delivery o f local services by supporting international investors considering infrastructure
investments at the sub-sovereign level.

123. I n the context o f its Arab World Initiative, the Bank will work with the Moroccan
authorities to capitalize on the opportunities o f better regional and cross-border cooperation.
Initiatives include:
The regional Concentrated Solar Power initiative (supported by concessional financing from the
Clean Technology Fund).
AAA products addressing barriers to economic integration both in terms of trade and FDI. The
Bank has developed a substantive knowledge program on financial integration and works closely
with the Arab Monetary Fund and the IMF.
In the area of regional transport, the Bank i s playing the role o f facilitator and knowledge partner.
In addition to contributing to the EU ‘Regional Transport Action Plan for the Mediterranean
Region 2007-20 13’ in partnership with the EU, EIB, AfDB and other donors, the Bank i s scoping
opportunities to further dialogue on logistics efficiency for intraregional trade through a portfolio
of ESW products.
On employability, the Bank i s active in the development o f a regional qualification system,
activating a regional labor market, and improving social protection and labor management for
migrants.
Morocco i s the focus o f several ESW products, TA and capacity building activities addressing
regional dimensions o f climate change adaptation. These address issues such as the impacts on
climate change on coastal cities, internal migration, the role o f climate change for the ecosystems
o f the region, technical support to planning and capacity for waste water treatment and a regional
analysis o f the economic and social impacts of climate change on agriculture).
In the water sector, MENA supports capacity building of institutions such as the Arab Water
Council, and activities such as the Arab Water Management Initiative, Regional Water Initiative
and a regional Institutional Development Fund grant in Public Engagement in Water
Management.
Morocco i s one of the founding members o f the Marseille Center for Mediterranean Integration
(MCMI) together with Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. The Center targets the strategic
territory o f upstream knowledge management, by facilitating joint learning across the
Mediterranean. The MCMI work builds on program clusters directly in line with Morocco’s

44

objectives. These include: (i) Skills, Employment and Labor Mobility, (ii)(Environment) and
Water; (iii) Urban and Spatial Development; (iv) Knowledge Economy, Innovation and
Technology. As a founding member, Morocco i s both set to benefit from and play a key role in
the success of the MCMI regional program.
124. The I F C will continue to support south-south investments and cross-border flows. Building
on i t s recent investment in BMCE Bank which targeted the bank’s expansion in 11 Sub-Saharan African
countries, IFC will continue to support Moroccan companies expansion at the regional level, namely in
the Maghreb and Africa. IFC will also pursue investments in Morocco with emerging regional players.

G.

Alignment, Harmonization, and Use of Country Systems

125. Donor financing has increased substantially during the past ten years. In 2006, total net
ODA and official aid reached $1,046 million (equivalent to 1.6% of GNI, or $34 per capita) up from $419
million (1.2% of GNI and $1 5 per capita) in 2000. The level of IBRD disbursements between 2005 and
2008 averaged $275 million per year, making it the second largest donor after the EU. Notwithstanding
i t s increasing level, ODA accounts for a relatively small proportion (less than 5%) o f total annual
government expenditure. Appendix 6 provides more details on donor’s deployment.
Donor coordination has improved, helped by strong national programs and the active role
126.
of government. Donors are working to ensure greater upstream coordination in country programs and
sector activities. This was visible in 2009 when four of Morocco’s main donors - World Bank, AfDB,
AFD and EU - initiated a process of mutual collaboration in the development of their respective new or
updated strategies. Cerfain areas such as INDH, public administration reform, education, have seen
particularly strong collaboration, with systematic use of joint missions, harmonized results frameworks,
and shared disbursement conditions. Others, like the rural road access program, have brought several
donors together around a sector-wide approach. Donors increasingly recognize their respective areas of
comparative advantage.

127.
The Bank Group i s committed to greater collaboration and harmonization. It stands ready
to provide support to the EU advanced status agreement, should the government want it. IBRD and the
EU are currently engaging jointly in five key areas, education, health, INDH, public administration
reform and rural roads, for a cumulatedjoint total financing estimated in excess of $900 million. In other
areas, such as justice, energy, and agricultural reform, parallel interventions are currently envisaged. This
collaboration i s expected to increase as the content of the advanced status agreement gets further defined.
The IFC will also continue i t s close coordination and collaboration with other donors and partners such as
AfJJB, EIB and Proparco, particularly in the infrastructureand financial markets sectors.
128.
Country systems are already the main channel for delivering donor support. Government’s
progress on the overall fiduciary framework, i t s efforts to improve i t s systems, and the degree of
transparency and openness to external validation it has demonstrated has led to increased reliance on
country systems to deliver donor financing. According to the 2008 Survey on the implementation of the
Paris Declaration, about 80 percent of donor financing was disbursed into what can broadly be described
as national systems. Budget support contributed significantly to this result.
129.
Morocco’s country systems, and its commitment to further strengthen them, underpin the
national development. program and the environment for donor support. Improvements in public
financial management, procurement and safeguard procedures form part o f the government’s overall
objective of improving the quality of the administration and reinforcing the competitiveness of the
national economy. I t confirmed i t s interest to be considered a candidate country in the piloting program
45

in the use of country procurement systems under Bank-supported operations. Following a CPAR (2007),
it i s undergoing further evaluation of i t s national procurement system. It also agreed to undergo external
bench-marked evaluations of its financial management systems (CFAA, 2003 & 2007, and PEFA in
2009). These assessments noted that Morocco’s systems are relatively strong and present low fiduciary
risk. They also identified areas needing improvement. Government has expressed a willingness to
address these, and in many cases has already agreed to the establishment o f improvement plans.
Appendix 5 provides more details on the status of the use of country systems in financial management,
procurement, and environmental and social safeguards.

130. Government has requested the Bank and other donors to make increased use of country
systems, in line with their commitments to do so in the Paris Declaration (2005) and Accra Agenda for
Action (2008).8 It wishes to see tangible progress toward this objective during CPS implementation.
Building on the processes described above, the Bank will sustain i t s partnership with the government to
assess systems, identify directions for improvements, invest in capacity building and accompany change
implementation, with the objective of progressively increasing the use of country systems.
VI.

RISKS

13 1. Two issues threaten the objectives of this Country Partnership Strategy. First, the short term
growth outlook i s subject to systemic and exogenous risks. Morocco i s confronted with uncertainties on
the timing, speed and shape of the recovery from the global crisis. While there are encouraging signs of a
possible end to the crisis, it i s too early to predict how the global economy will emerge from the
recession. It i s yet unclear to what extent Morocco will continue to be confronted with the impact of the
economic slowdown on i t s exports, remittances, ability to attract FDI and sustainability o f its public
stimulus program. Morocco’s track record of strong macroeconomic management suggests that it i s well
placed to face the uncertainties arising from the current crisis. The Bank will help mitigate the associated
economic risks through continued monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on the overall
macroeconomic context, as well as analysis of options for remedial measures as eventually requested by
the government.
132. Second, the successful implementation o f government reform agenda hinges on political
economy factors. Once second-generation reforms are rolled out, the resistance of vested interests will
add to the complexities of implementation. Possible outcomes include the derailing of reforms’
objectives, a stalling o f the reform process, and a decline of the credibility of the reform agenda in the
eyes o f public opinion. Government’s recent emphasis on deep governance reforms, such as that of the
justice sector, i s a key factor in the mitigation of these risks. The Bank Group will offer appropriate TA with, if requested, a specific focus on political economy constraints - to support the operationalizationof
sector strategies.

* Paragraph 15 o f the Accra Agenda for Action states that “Donors agree to use country systems as the first option for aid
programs in support o f activities managed by the public sector [. . .] Should donors choose to use another option and rely on aid
delivery mechanisms outside country systems (including parallel project implementation units), they will transparently state the
rationale for this and will review their positions at regular intervals.”

Appendix 2

Appendix 2: PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Lines of engagement of the World Bank and the IFC over the CPS 2010-2014 period
Private sector development, competitiveness and the structural transformation of the Moroccan
economy:

I.

Private sector development in Morocco: progress in reforms, the new sectoral approach and the
persistence o f old challenges

1.
Over the past decade, Morocco has made a lot o f progress in business environment reforms.
The private sector has responded to these reforms, but productivity, export diversification and
technological intensity lag other emerging countries. The needed structural transformation of the
Moroccan economy i s not yet happening. Since the business environment reforms accelerated in the
mid-nineties, private investment rates increased from 15 percent to 22 percent currently - a rate that
compares to the ones in the most dynamic economies. The attractiveness of FDI has also been strong.
However, most of this rise in private investment has occurred outside of the manufacturing sector (figure
A2.1) - mostly in real estate, tourism and services. In fact, 72 percent of manufacturing value-added and
77 percent of exports in 2008 were of low technological intensity. Even if entrepreneurship has flourished
over the past years - business entry rates increased from 8 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2007, most of
it i s either in low-value added activities or in non-tradablereal estate, services and construction sectors. In
manufacturing, fewer f i r m s are created than was the case twenty years ago, fewer export (20 percent in
2007 compared to 27 percent in 1995), and new f i r m s are less productive than older firms. The
concentration of private investment in lower value-added activities explain why Morocco lags other
countries in labor productivity: in 2007, it represented only 20 percent o f the average labor productivity in
manufacturing in the OECD, and about 50 percent of that in middle-income emerging countries.

All these are symptoms o f weak creative destruction in the Moroccan economy, and therefore weaker
economic and productivity growth prospects. N o emerging economy has been able to sustain high growth
of long periods of time, without a profound structural transformation of its economy made of increased
manufacturing exports and a more diversified and more technologically sophisticated private sector. This
transformation i s not yet happening at a large scale in Morocco.

62

Appendix 2

2.
Such structural transformation of the private sector requires a comprehensive and
coordinated set o f policies in many areas: a stable macroeconomic environment; an improved business
environment - including in the area of infrastructure and in regulatory institutions that level the playing
field; a trade policy that supports the competitiveness o f Moroccan products; a financial sector that better
serves smaller firms; a labor force that i s better trained and effective social protection and labor market
institutions. While progress in all these areas i s notable, there i s a strong need to increase the impact o f
reforms and the response o f private investors to these reforms. Weaknesses remain in the business
environment, especially in those areas like regulatory reform - that require a lot o f public agency
coordination, and where a gap remains between the laws as they appear on the books and how they’re
applied to individual investors. While export development plans are in place (Emergence and Maroc
Export) and Morocco adopted an ambitious FTA agenda, some areas of the trade policy - including trade
logistics and trade finance - remain weak. Financial sector reforms have been impressive in Morocco, but
there i s room for these reforms to trickle down to domestic SMEs that remain credit constrained. Finally,
the employability of Moroccan workers in a changing environment remains a critical problem in the labor
market: firms which need to move up the value chain to remain competitive require better trained workers
currently a scarce resource according to business surveys. In face o f this scarcity, the reform o f the
education system i s only slowly improving the employability o f new job seekers. Improving the skills of
the labor force, the functioning o f labor market institutions and the effectiveness o f social protection i s
paramount to help the structural transformation o f the Moroccan economy.

-

3,
The global crisis and its impact on Morocco’s balance o f payments i s also a reminder o f the
need to diversify and enlarge the country’s export base. Manufacturing exports have grown at 8
percent per year on average since 2002 - half the performance of emerging middle-income countries. The
contents of exports i s also symptomatic o f the slow structural transformation of the Moroccan economy:
out o f its 20 most important exports, only one was in an activity growing in global trade and where
Morocco i s gaining world market share. Also, exports are not diversified enough: Morocco exports 42
products per one million inhabitants, compared to 130 for Tunisia and 160 for Malaysia (figure A2.2).
Yet, this trend has improved lately with the growth o f exports o f services and new niches in electronics
and car parts.
4.
The new industrial strategy in place bets on further growth of these emerging sectors
(offshoring, electronics, aeronautics, car parts) and other, more established exports (e.g. textile,
agribusiness, tourism) - hence its name, Emergence. To increase private investment, exports and job
creation, the government has launched a series o f sectoral plans (most notably in tourism and industry).
These consist mainly o f tax incentives to specific sectors, combined with dedicated infrastructure
investments. The roll-out o f the 2005-2008 Programme Emergence has been mainly focused on the
offshoring and textile sectors. I t has also given strong signals to the automobile and aeronautic sectors
which have benefited from notable foreign investments over the recent years.

5.
Looking forward, the challenge will be in the implementation and coordination o f all the
policies that affect private sector development-in particular to address persistent transversal
constraints in the business environment that affect mostly domestic SMEs. The success of all the
sectoral programs (in industry, trade, agriculture, tourism, skills development, etc.) will depend on the
ability of the government to coordinate, implement and evaluate policies at various levels and through
various agencies. This has proven to be especially difficult in the past when strong inter-agency
coordination i s required. A l l these interventions and support plans are also heavily constrained by
remaining transversal issues in the business environment: the availability of skills; access to land and
finance for SMEs; rules and regulations - and especially their implementation by the administrations in
charge - that are cumbersome and often arbitrarily and inconsistently applied; and a weak judiciary.
Recently, the new ambitious public-private Pacte national pour 1 'Emergence Industrielle was
launched to address these transversal issues and sectoral plans in a coordinated manner. New interministerial commissions have been created to improve coordination. As with previous plans and
commissions, the main challenge will be in their implementation.
11.

World Bank Group support for a more competitive private sector in Morocco

6.
Over the CPS horizon, the World Bank and the I F C will continue to support-in
a
coordinated and complementary way - the Moroccan government in its private sector development
policies, specifically in the areas of business environment, trade, financial sector development and
public-private partnerships. This support will take the form of: (i)technical assistance and policy
advice by both institutions - some of it done jointly; (ii)policy-based lending by the World Bank; and,
(iii)investments and lending by IFC to private entities, and possibly transaction-based advice in the area
of public-private partnership. This joint appendix describes the challenges o f private sector development
in Morocco, focusing on the four areas above. In view of the Government current policies, it also
describes the type of cooperation and support that will be provided by both arms o f the World Bank
Group during the duration o f the CPS.
7.
The guiding principles o f the World Bank Group engagement in the private sector
development are consistent to the pillars and overall approach o f the CPS: It will be flexible to be
responsive to government requests and emerging priorities; and selective, by focusing on higher impact
activities that are in line with the most important business environment issues facing the private sector.
64

Appendix 2

The Bank-IFC activities will also be consistent with the strategic pillars o f the CPS. Supporting private
sector development by improving the trade and business environment i s at the core o f the
competitiveness-growth-employment challenge of the Moroccan economy (pillar 1). Similarly,
supporting the development o f public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the social sectors will contribute to
improving the delivery o f social services to citizens, as to improving access to financial services o f the
poor (pillar 2). PPPs in the infrastructure sectors will also help the Moroccan government in responding to
the infrastructure needs of its economy (in water, energy and transport for example), in a sustainable way
(pillar 3). As will be argued in section 3 below, governance issues-a transversal theme that i s common
to all three pillars o f the CPS, appear prominently in the private sector development agenda.

111.

IBRD and IFC complementary roles in investment and advisory projects

8.
The successful experience of cooperation between the two institutions over the past years
will be carried on during the next CPS period. The Bank has usually taken the lead in strategic
analytical exercises (like the investment climate assessments) or policy advice, while the IFC - through its
Advisory Services activities - has been focusing on more operational assistance, supporting the
implementation o f reforms. The key has been a joint involvement at the initial stages o f every
engagement, and close coordination during every TA or ESW project, including at the design stage. Bank
staff involved in analytical work has systematically been involved in the initial conceptual phase o f
advisory projects. Inversely, IFC was systematically consulted and involved in the preparation o f
analytical pieces by the World Bank.
During the next CPS period, such collaboration will continue to target areas of strategic
9.
focus. In particular, IFC’s investment strategy in Morocco will complement the Bank’s strategic priorities
in the infrastructure sectors. In the area of public-private partnerships-an area where WBG support has
been requested by the government, the Bank will support the government in the development o f an
adequate legal framework (in specific sectors, or at the.broader level). The IFC could provide advisory
support in specific PPP transactions, or be an investor itself in public-private ventures. This support could
be provided along the lines o f IFC’s landmark PPP advisory transaction in the irrigation sector in the
Guerdane region in Morocco.

A.

IFC’s engagement in Morocco and current strategy

10.
I F C has significantly picked up its activities in Morocco and currently has a committed
portfolio o f USS272.5 million in 12 companies. During the period FY08-09, IFC committed a record
US$255 in seven projects in multiple sectors in Morocco, such as commercial banks, microfinance,
wastewater public utilities, investment funds for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), property
development in low income housing and building materials sector. While IFC has historically had a
selective approach in Morocco due to the availability o f alternative sources o f financing, IFC has stepped
up its activities and been positioning itself on strategic investments and partnerships, with clear
additionality and role. IFC’s engagement i s predominantly in financial markets (53% o f total
commitments), including microfinance providing much needed access to finance to the poorer segments
o f the population and in general manufacturing (35% o f commitments).
11.
IFC has also developed a sizeable advisory program in Morocco, with a focus on (a)
promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to improving the business environment - with the
Ministry of Justice; (b) helping identify public-private partnerships in key infrastructure sectors - with the
Ministry of Finance; (c) simplifying business creations starting with the city o f Casablanca; and (d)
strengthening credit information and SME finance, through the establishment o f a private credit bureau -

65

Appendix 2

with the Central Bank. In addition, IFC i s providing advisory work to Morocco’s microfinance sector as
part o f i t s investment packages.

12.
Despite competitive market conditions and availability o f other sources o f financing, IFC
can still play a significant financing role for large investments exceeding the capacity o f domestic
banks or for innovative projects requiring complex structuring through the use o f equity, quasi-equity and
structured finance products. IFC’s value-added also lies in i t s global expertise combined with a good
local presence and image in the market. With a more vibrant private sector environment and important
developments in key sectors, IFC has increased opportunities and can play a key role in the financial
sector, in infrastructure, and in the manufacturing, and agribusiness sectors.
13.
Looking forward to the CPS period, and in line with the principle o f additionality and role,
IFC’s investments will focus on the infrastructure sectors (power, ports, renewable energy,
transport, and utilities sectors), financial sector (microfinance and SMEs) as well as select
investments in manufacturing, agribusiness, education activities and municipal/local finance. This
investment strategy will be aligned with the priority activities o f the World Bank in these sectors and will
complement the technical assistance and financial support the Bank intends to provide along the three
pillars. IFC’s potential infrastructure investments in energy, utilities or the ports, as well as selected
investments in Emergence’s sectors, would contribute to the growthhompetitiveness agenda of the CPS
(pillar 1). Potential investments in the education and microfinance sectors would help in improving
financial and education services to citizens, especially the most disadvantaged (pillar 2). Finally, the focus
on potential investments in renewable energy and the power sector will contribute to reaching the
objectives o f the third pillar of the CPS for sustainable development and the climate change agenda (pillar
3).
14.
IFC will also continue focusing on South-South investments and building strategic
partnerships with regional players. Given that Morocco i s increasingly investing in the region, namely
in West and East Africa, IFC would like to accompany Moroccan companies’ expansion in AfricdIDA
countries, along the lines of IFC’s recent investment in BMCE Bank, targeting the bank’s expansion into
11 Sub Saharan African countries.
15.
I n complement to its investment activities, IFC’s Advisory Services in M E N A will also
continue to provide advisory services to improving the business enabling environment, building
capacity of financial intermediaries to lend to MSMEs and encouraging public private partnerships in
infrastructure.

Getting specific: priority areas of engagement

Improving the business environment for all firms and leveling the playing field

Current challenges and policies:
16.
Diversifying the economy will require improving the business environment through
complex and in-depth reforms of the legal, regulatory and administrative frameworks, which
restrict access o f new entrants to the market while favoring established incumbents. The ability of
the government to carry on complex investment climate reforms will be essential to address this
challenge. Despite the many reforms carried on over the past decade, there seems to be a growing gap
between the government ability to launch and adopt new legislations and regulations, and its ability to
design adequately and implement key reforms that could actually make a difference for the private
sector. Several key constraints in the business environment remain problematic for firms. Access to land
66

Appendix 2

remains a pending and binding constraint to firm growth-and more so for exporters, as i s tax rates. In
spite of several reductions, Morocco has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world and the
existing tax regime penalizes the recruiting of skilled workers-a scarce resource according to firms.
More generally, administrative procedures and the judicial system lack transparency and need to be
better managed to avoid corruption (a growing constraints for a representative panel of businesses
interviewed both in 2004 and 2007-one that affects disproportionally more smaller domestic firms),
discretion and privileges to connected businesses. A consequence of a constraining business
environment, corruption and poor property rights enforcement, i s the uneven playing field in the
business place-competition from the informal sector and monopolistic situations of a few large
incumbents hurt the development of some sectors and the emergence of new industrial players. These
issues are consistently rated in firm surveys as the most important constraints to businesses (figure
A2.4).

Many o f these constraints-corruption, administrative uncertainty, enforcement of the
rules and the judiciary-relate to issues o f governance of market institutions. Whether it i s with the

judiciary, the discretionary enforcement of regulations by the public administrations, the independence
and efficacy of market regulatory institutions-in particular in ensuring fair competition and a leveled
playing field; or the control of corruption, the private sector development agenda i s fundamentally
charged by governance challenges. The link with other priority topics of the CPS where the government
have requested Bank support i s clearest in the area of judicial reform. The judicial system, through
commercial courts, should play a key role in the development of commercial transactions by providing a
predictable and reliable mechanism for the resolution of commercial dispute. Since commercial courts
have been established in 1997, progress towards a professional and secured judicial system has been slow.
Morocco i s among the middle-income countries where businesses complain the most about the judiciary

being a constraint to growth (figure A2.5). Most o f them perceive the system to be unfair and the
enforcement o f the rules and regulations to be unclear and subjective (figure A2.6).

18.
Willing to address cross cutting constraints in the investment climate, the Moroccan
government has launched several reform initiatives supported by ad hoc inter-ministerial working
groups o r committees. The results have been mixed. The efficiency o f this institutional structure to
foster reforms o f the business environment has remained relatively weak. These committees tend to suffer
from a number o f recurrent weaknesses such as the lack o f a clear mandate, unclear political commitment
and leadership, weak capacity, and absence o f methodology and monitoring tools.

68

Appendix 2

19.
Recently, the government has developed a new comprehensive approach to private sector
development, that aims at addressing past weaknesses in the conduct of partial, uncoordinated
reforms. By formally adopting in February 2009 the “National Pact o f Industrial Emergence - Pacte
National pour I ’Emergence Industrielle (PNEI, Contrat Programme 2009-2015”, the government has
established a public private agreement aimed at undertaking 11 1 specific commitments over the period
2009-20 15, taken both by ministries (Justice, Interior, Economy and Finance, Agriculture and Fishing,
Education and research, Labor and Training, Industry, Commerce and New Technologies, International
Trade, Economic and General Affairs) and representatives o f private sector organizations (CGEM, Banks’
Professional Organization GPBM) signatories to the Agreement. These commitments are gathered under
10 different pillars: Off-shoring, Automobile, Aeronautic, Electronics, Textile and Leather, AgroIndustry, SME Competitiveness, Investment Climate, Training, Industrial Zones).

20.
The government’s strategic plan for private sector development is a mix between sectorspecific policies and comprehensive investment climate reforms. Its first axis o f measures i s sectorspecific, and focuses on the sectors previously identified in the Emergence 2005 program. The second
axis i s aimed at addressing cross-cutting constraints under the “Investment Climate” PNEI pillar. Under
this second axis, the government i s establishing a Public Private committee for business environment
(“Comite National de I’Environnement des Affaires” - CNEA) in charge o f identifying economic reform
projects and overseeing their actual implementation through improved inter-ministerial coordination
mechanisms. This committee i s headed by the Prime Minister. Its participants and working groups follow
a common methodology and approach to the reform, in order to address the coordination issues that
plagued the ability o f previous reform committees to deliver on otherwise well-designed action plans.

World Bank engagement:
2 1.

The objective of the Bank support in the area of private sector development is to promote a
business environment favorable to new entrants, in particular to small and medium domestic firms.
To this end, for the duration o f the CPS, the Bank will assist the government in reducing the current
unpredictability and opaqueness o f the legal, administrative and judicial aspects o f i t s business
environment, which tend to favor well-established investors. Promoting transparency and accessibility o f
laws, regulations, circulars, and procedures that shape the Morocco’s business environment will therefore
be a priority of Bank’s assistance. An action plan o f priority legal and regulatory reforms has recently
been adopted by the CNEA Committee and the government has solicited World Bank Group support to
the different reform teams in charge o f implementing it. This action plan will form the basis o f the
cooperation between the World Bank Group and the government o f Morocco in the area of investment
climate reforms.

22.

I n addition, the Bank will assist the government in setting up an organized, efficient and
participatory reform process. This assistance will aim at developing a well-managed use o f consultation
mechanisms and economic analysis for preparing projects. U s e o f monitoring and evaluation tools will
also be promoted as essential tools for measuring progress o f investment climate reforms. Consultation
process, economic impact analysis and monitoring tools will be used and designed to measure the
satisfaction o f end-users on government’s policy and administrative services.

23.
I n line with these priorities, several technical assistance activities are envisaged for the CPS
period:
0

Continuing the current activity aimed at assisting the MAEG in coordinating and implementing
reform processes in the business environment area, through the development o f the CNEA, and
focusing on the 20 - item investment climate action plan.
69

Appendix 2

Assessing and prioritizing the reform needs of the business environment - The Bank will assist
the government in preparing detailed and prioritized annual reform programs for private sector
development.
0

Launching a regulatory simplification project - A project aimed at identifying, analyzing and
simplifying all administrative and regulatory procedures for businesses. This technical assistance
project, based on a specifically-tailored regulatory simplification approach developed by the Bank
and other international institutions, could have a major impact on the quality o f administrative
services and the easiness to do business in Morocco.
Improving the governance o f enterprises - Following the adoption o f a non-binding code o f
corporate governance for enterprises, next steps could focus on a detailed assessment o f
governance framework and practices for listed companies. This assessment would allow
disseminating international best practices for corporate behavior and initiate reforms aimed at
further developing the use o f financial markets by private sector.

24.
I n addition to the technical assistance activities, a comprehensive approach to the trade and
competitiveness issue could take the form o f a Competitiveness Development Policy Loan that would
integrate an investment climate pillar as well as a trade and competitiveness pillar. Such a project would
support the different policy initiatives that are ongoing in Morocco, and which aim at increasing and
diversifying the export base in face o f the structural deterioration of the balance o f payments.

I F C engagement:
25.
The I F C will continue to focus on developing investment and lending opportunities in
support o f the new industrial and agriculture strategies of Morocco. Morocco’s industrial and
agricultural strategies aim at anchoring the country’s strategy to supporting the emergence o f world-class
firms in a select number o f sectors where Morocco’s comparative advantages are deemed substantial: (i)
agribusiness; (ii) light automotive and aerospace manufacturing; (iii) fisheries; (iv) business process
outsourcing; (v) electronics; and (vi) industrial “handicrafts”. Modernization o f these industries to
become internationally competitive could offer investment opportunities for IFC.
26.
I n the area of advisory activities, IFC’s Advisory Services in the M E N A region, will
continue to support business environment reforms, in close coordination with the World Bank. The
IFC will focus on areas that require field expertise in regulatory reform, and process reengineering for
regulatory simplification. IFC’s support will be selective reflecting availability o f donor financing and
additionality. Moreover, in support to the second pillar o f the Judicial Reform Ian o f Morocco (this six2009), IFC’s Advisory
pillar major reform was announced by King Mohammed V I on August 20,‘
Services in MENA will further its support to the development o f alternative dispute resolutions systems
(as arbitration and mediation), starting with capacity building o f a mediation and arbitration center in
Casablanca.
B.

Improving trade and competitiveness to rip the gains o f openness and FTAs

Current challenges and policies:
27.

Morocco strives to use trade policy to boost growth and job creation by expanding markets
for Moroccan goods and services and transforming Morocco into an investment and production
platform for global investors wanting shift production processes to competitive and logistically efficient
sites. However, current efforts have not yet led to robust export performance nor accelerated significantly

70

Appendix 2

the structural transformation of the economy. Furthermore, the preferential stance in trade liberalization i s
increasingtariff dispersion leading to trade diversion and providing incentives for fraud.

28.
Export performance i s below expectations, leading to forgone growth and job creation
opportunities. Export grew by only 93% between 2000 and 2008 against more than 300% for the MENA
and East Asia regions in the same period. Because global trade grew robustly in that period, Morocco lost
world market share in merchandise exports. Despite the signing of a large number of preferential trade
agreements, the geography of export destination has not changed significantly yet. Morocco s t i l l ships
75% of i t s exports to the EU, only a few percentage points lower than in 2000. Exports to MENA, SSA
and the USA are still low. Overall, producers tend to be small and medium enterprises facing many
constraints in their environment that make them ill-prepared to take advantage of the opportunities offered
by the global market. These constraints include access to finance, unfair competition with the informal
sector, macroeconomic instability, etc. Exporting i s a sustainable activity for only a fraction of SMEs in
Morocco.
Lackluster export performance led to worsening trade balance. The trade deficit increased
29.
from $3.2 billion in 2000 to $14.1 billion in 2007. However, Morocco has been able to maintain current
account surpluses thanks to strong

economy. A sign of this i s that
relatively fewer firms have engaged in
exports over the past years (figure A2.7).

30.
The pace of structural transformation/ diversification i s indeed slow. The technological
content of export i s progressing(32% o f total in 2008 against 22% in 2000) but Moroccan exports are still
highly concentrated in low-value added or primary export products (60 percent). The little in the way of
increase in technological content of export i s due to rising FDI in aeronautics and mechanical
engineering. However, FDI to industry remains limited (5% of the total in 2008) as the bulk of foreign
investment in Morocco goes to construction (30%), tourism (19%) and banking (13%). The extent of
diversification i s highly dependent on FDI and in the years to come, Morocco should strive to attract more
FDI in industries. This would be an important instrument to reduce unemployment of educated and highly
skilled would-be workers. Without a shift in labor demand in favor of highly qualified jobs, trade
integration will not be able to help employment.
3 1,
Tariff dispersion is creating distortions and increasing incentives for fraud on the origin of
goods. Morocco’s commitment to further opening of its market, notably by implementing the Association
Agreement with the EU, results in widening tariff gaps across import origins. The preferential
liberalization will reduce import tariffs vis-a-vis the EU, and bring the overall average of effectively
applied duties further down. However, the MFN tariffs towards third countries will not automatically

71

Appendix 2

follow the path o f the EU and phase-out schedule agricultural tariffs will only be marginally affected, as a
result of their limited coverage in the Euro-Med Agreement. The increased wedges between agricultural
and manufacturing tariffs, as well as disparities between manufacturing products originating in the EU
and those originating in non-preferential trade partners may create trade diversion and fraud on origin.
The latter would increase unfair competition in the domestic market and could undermine investment.

32.
T o address the above challenges, Morocco i s reducing trade and investment barriers and i s
pursuing deeper preferential integration (Le., including some degree o f regulatory convergence) with
external anchors through its Association Agreement with the EU (75% of Moroccan trade) and a Free
Trade Agreement with the USA. Shallower preferential agreements were signed with a large number o f
partners, including the Arab League under GAFTA, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan under the AGADIR
Agreement, Turkey and other bilateral partners. Significant progress i s being made in improving transport
and logistics and the efficiency o f backbone services (ports, air transport, telecommunications and
financial services). More recently, Morocco has elaborated sectoral strategies to attract foreign investment and
strengthen production in key strategic sectors such as aeronautics, offshoring of services, automobile components,
etc.

World Bank and IFC engagement:
33.
The World Bank Group intends to support Morocco’s above trade integration policies, and
will focus on five interdependent outcomes/results: i)tariff and non-tariff reforms on an MFN basis; ii)
further investment climate reforms to enhance the capacity o f SME to exploit opportunities offered by the
global market; iii) hrther reduction o f barriers to trade and investment in services and regulatory
convergence with the EU in selected areas o f Morocco’s interest; iv) export promotion and v)
modernization o f Morocco’s innovation system. These areas are crucial if trade integration i s to foster
greater competitiveness and job creation and to contribute to a transition to a knowledge-based, skillintensive and technology-based economy.
34.
I t i s important to view these five pillars of the trade integration strategy as integrated and to
attempt to make progress in all o f them to maximize impact. The whole i s greater than the sum o f i t s
individual parts. One o f the key potential benefits o f Bank’s involvement will be to help better integrate
the different elements o f Morocco’s trade and investment strategy.
35.
Effectively supporting Morocco in the above five areas could be done through two main
instruments. First, through the potential Competitiveness Development Policy Loan, which could
include a trade and integration pillar that would support, in an integrated fashion, measures to:
Reduce trade transaction costs through tariff reforms, convergence to EU product and quality
standards and reduction o f time and cost to trade through selective and streamlined technical
controls o f imports and e-governance o f trade procedures;
Improve trade finance and trade insurance to facilitate the penetration of new markets
Assist in implementing the services trade reforms scheduled in the Morocco-USA Free Trade
Agreement
Further encourage investment and trade in services by reducing the regulatory and policy
bottlenecks faced by firms in emerging exporting sectors.
The development o f new export promotion instruments, the modernization and streamlining o f
trade-support and innovation-support institutions.

72

Appendix 2

36.
Second, it will be important to continue Bank support to build adequate technical capacity and
tools to support and monitor the trade strategy. The Bank's capacity building efforts in recent years
successful helped strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Foreign trade. However, while the tools recently
developed by the Ministry have increased their capacity to inform policy (the IMPALE MODELE), fbrther
support i s needed for the current models to address emerging issues such as the impact o f the Emergence Plan
and the structural transformation o f the economy. Additional technical assistance to improve the IMPALE
MODELE (Ministry o f Foreign Trade) and enhance capacity in other relevant Ministries i s warranted. The Bank
will also continue its technical support in the areas o f trade logistics and trade in agriculture.
37.
The IFC's will complement World Bank activities in the trade area through its advisory support
in the business environment area. Also, potential investments in ports activity or logistical platforms in
Morocco would also contribute to improvingthe trade logistics infiastructure of the Kingdom.
C.

Support to financial sector reform

Current challenges and policies:
38.
Morocco's primary objective in the financial sector is to ensure an efficient and stable
financing of the evolving needs of its economy Following a major modernization effort spearheaded
by the Moroccan authorities, the financial system appears well positioned to address upcoming challenges
thanks to i t s development (with assets totaling almost twice the GDP), the existence o f key market
mechanisms, a good diversification among sectors compared to regional peers and a restructured stateowned financial sector. The Moroccan financial system i s increasingly opening up and building ties with
neighboring economies. Financial institutions have not been directly affected by the global financial
crisis.

39.
While improving access o f poorer households and smaller firms to modern financial
services. Morocco's commercial banks are among the more sophisticated in MENA and offer a wide
range of financial services through specialized subsidiaries. However, they are mostly geared towards
serving big corporations, a segment which i s reaching saturation. A large portion o f the population i s not
being served by this banking system (bank penetration rate stands at a low 25-30 percent). Similarly, in
the corporate world, despite the progress o f the recent years in terms o f firm access to credit, too many
73

Appendix 2

SMEs remain credit-constrained, and large proportions of them consistently rate “Lack of access to
finance” among their top constraints - even if that proportion declined since 2004 (figure A2.8).
40.
The financial sector first challenge is to keep improving its provision of financial services to
all Moroccan economic agents:
Meeting growing needs for long term finance (investment projects, housing etc.). Banks have
been active in providing long term loans in the past few years, when funding was easy. They still
bear most of these long term risks, which reduces their leeway to make new loans, and face a
more challenging funding environment, as the financial system i s less flush with liquidity.
Moreover, although the size of Moroccan institutional investors bodes well for the potential
development of long term instruments (long term bonds, securitization etc.), this potential i s not
yet tapped on a large scale, either by financial institutions or by other companies.
Ensuring that SMEs as well as a wider proportion of Moroccan citizens can have access to
financial services ( e g about a third of Moroccan individuals have access to banking products).
SME finance i s critical for the Moroccan economy considering SMEs’ contribution to growth and
employment. Additional progress i s still needed (in terms of availability, advice, venture capital
etc.).

41.

A second challenge relates to the ongoing modernization of the financial infrastructure,
including the supervisory framework, to sustain the development of the financial sector while
preserving i t s safety:
Ensuring that capital market and insurance sector’s supervision can be carried out at arm’s length,
from the government and from the industry. In a more complex, globaly integrated and market
driven environment, the independence of the insurance and, to a lesser extent, securities
supervisors need to be bolstered. They would provide strong foundations on which to improve the
regulation and supervision of these industries,
Implementing the new Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML /CFT) regime across the financial sector.

The Moroccan authorities prepared a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges.
42.
In a speech delivered in July 2008, the Minister of Economy and Finance presented this strategy, which
includes second generation reforms after state-owned financial institutions were restructured, banking
supervision dramatically improved and key financial infrastructure modernized. I t incorporates
recommendations made during the 2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP):

Bolstering the provision of long term finance by (1) the promotion of long term savings
(especially by individuals), (2) more efficient market mechanisms (long term benchmark yield
curve, revised securitization framework etc.) and (3) a better coordination among state-owned
financial institutions. More risk sensitive regulation for the insurance and pension sectors may
also increase their demand for long dated products, making it easier to place long term debt,
Promoting access to finance for individuals and improving further SME finance thanks to: (1) a
revamp of public support mechanisms for SME finance, (2) the modernization of the financial
services of the Post office, so that it can offer a broader range o f services to its many customers
(13% of Moroccans), (3) the set up of a credit bureau which will be fully operational by
September 2009, and (4) a review of the framework applicable to the microfinance sector,

74

Appendix 2

Modernizing securities markets with (1) the creation o f an organized market for derivative
products, designed to help economic agents hedge their financial risks, (2) a diversification o f the
shareholding o f the stock exchange beyond brokers , (3) a reform o f the regulatory framework for
asset management and (4) the strengthening o f the securities supervisor’s independence,
Creating a fully independent insurance supervisor (in lieu o f the current division o f the Ministry
of Economy and Finance),
Implementingthe AML /CFT regime across the industry,
Continuing the international opening o f the Moroccan financial sector. Contemplated measures
include (1) a further liberalization of the capital account, (2) an increased flexibility o f the
exchange rate and (3) more financial integration with Maghreb countries as well as other
neighbors (European Union, African countries etc.).

43.
These measures should also help enhance the resilience o f the financial system, thanks to (i)
better regulation and supervision, (ii) improved risk management possibilities (development o f long term
compartments, new market etc.) and (iii) enhanced operational coordination among financial sector
authorities.

World Bank engaRement:
44.
The World Bank will continue to support the authorities in addressing these challenges.
Beyond the assistance provided at the time o f the first financial sector Development Policy Loan (DPL,
2005) and during the latest FSAP (2007), the World Bank i s working with the Moroccan authorities on:
(1) identifying key areas in the securities sector where progress could be made to meet the best
international standards; and (ii)on strengthening financial stability arrangements.
45.
The World Bank i s also exploring the possibility o f providing additional lending through a
new financial sector DPL which would support the authorities’ reform agenda. In this context, the World
Bank will provide assistance in the form o f analytical work to help design the specifics o f the reform
agenda.

46.
The contemplated financial sector DPL is a key element of the CPS program. It would be
built around four pillars:

IFC engagement:
48.
Consistent with the overall financial sector reform agenda of the Government, I F C will
continue its support via its advisory services as well as through strategic investments in financial
institutions, including microfinance institutions and possibly SME finance instruments. On the
investment side, IFC will continue to look for opportunities to invest in financial institutions that aim at
developing low income banking and to supporting the emergence o f some banks as regional players. In
terms o f advisory activities, technical support to strengthen the credit information infrastructure will
continue to be provided to the central bank and possibly to specific banks. Other potential advisory
activities include capacity building to financial institutions in risk management, modern SME lending
techniques and credit scoring.
D.

Public-private partnerships for more efficient service delivery and responding to
infrastructure needs

Current challenges and policies:
49.
Morocco has developed a valuable experience in PPPs during the past decade. In many
aspects, it has been a pioneer in the use of PPPs in the MENA region. Sectors as diverse as power
generation, water and electricity distribution, urban transport, waste management, container terminals,
irrigation, among others, have seen one or more PPPs developed and implemented. In contrast to other
developing countries where for instance water concessions were canceled or renegotiated soon after
approvals, water and electricity distribution concessions in Morocco have passed the test of time and have
performed well in achieving their development objectives.
50.
The number of public-private partnerships involving municipalities significantly increasedg
over the past decade, even though the government did not establish a modern PPP framework until
2005. Urban transport concessions were issued to private bus companies in Casablanca, Rabat,
Marrakech, and Agadir by the end o f the 1980s. This surge o f interest in private participation in
infrastructure was driven by two main consideration: (i) tighter fiscal space constraints significantly
limited the central government ability to cope with the growing infrastructure needs o f the economy and
the society; and (ii) the decentralization agenda that led to the consolidation o f municipalities as primary
responsible entities for the delivery/supply o f local public infrastructure services such as water and
electricity distribution, sewage, solid waste collection and management, streets lighting, urban transport
services to municipalities. In this regards, municipalities can opt to deliver these services through
municipal owned utilities or by contracting out to private sector.

51.
However, despite this breadth o f experiences, Morocco’s use o f PPPs remains an ad hoc
process, lacking a strategic vision and constrained by a number of shortcomings. Morocco’s use o f
PPPs remains significantly below potential. As of to date, the implementation o f PPPs projects have been
highly fragmented and decentralized. It i s crucial to move from this piecemeal approach into a more
comprehensive and integrated approach that aims to the development of a vibrant PPP market in
Morocco. The development of PPPs in Morocco remains constrained by:

Water and electricity distribution: Casablanca (l997), Rabat (1999), Tanger and Tetouan (2002). In Solid waste management:
around 15 collection service contracts (5 years duration), and few BOT contracts for landfills management. In urban transport numerous service concession agreements are in place for urban bus transportation services in cities.

76

Appendix 2
Lack of a clear PPP visionary approach - it has now become urgent that the government
prepares and publishes a PPP policy paper that outlines its visionary approach about PPPs and
how it intends to strengthen the existing PPP framework, and implement the next generation o f
PPP projects.
Incomplete PPP legal and regulatory framework - bylaws and executive regulations o f Law
54-05 have not been issued four years after its enactment. Further, law 54-05 has provided
Morocco with a modern PPP legal framework which applies specifically to PPP projects
undertaken by municipalities and state owned enterprises (ONEP, ONE, RAM, etc.).
Unfortunately, Law 54-05 does not apply to PPPs that could be initiated directly by the central
government.
Institutional weaknesses in contracts oversight and enforcement - For instance: (i) most
municipalities still lack capacity to prepare high quality PPP transactions and are dependent on
the support mobilized by the Interior Ministry; (ii)municipalities are still ill equipped to exercise
their oversight over PPP contracts and effective regulation o f PPP/concession contracts i s uneven
depending on project; (iii)the sanctity o f the PPP contracts i s often breached by granting
authorities therefore weakening the balanced commitments agreed in the contracts; (iv) in some
sectors such as solid waste management, granting authorities often fail to appropriate adequate
budgetary resources to service their payment commitments with the private operator; (v) tariffs
are not automatically adjusted according to indexation formulae agreed in the contracts; and, (vi)
PPP contracts as any other administrative contracts are subject to the external audit o f the “Cour
des comptes” whereas modalities for such audits have not been defined.
Weak coordination mechanism and lack o f a framework to manage PPP fiscal risks - The
implementation o f PPPs i s highly decentralized whereas there i s a need to strengthen coordination
in project preparation to ensure consistency o f contractual arrangements across sectors. The
absence o f a dedicated PPP unit makes the whole process inefficient, non predictable and time
costly.
Absence of a reliable dispute resolution mechanism for PPP contracts - with the
multiplication o f PPP contracts, there i s a need to establish a dedicated dispute resolution
mechanism for PPPs besides the tribunal administrative.
Multiplicity o f counterparts on the public party end (municipalities, Ministry o f Interior,
Ministry o f Finance, etc.).
e

E.

Regulatory uncertainty in regards o f transfer of staff when there i s a change o f the equity
investor (private party) in a given PPP/concession project (e.g.: renewal o f solid waste collection
contracts for Agdal-Ryad in Rabat or El Jadida).
The Case for PPPs

52.
The central argument in favor of PPPs is that of efficiency gains. This essentially means that: (a)
for new (greenfield) projects, a significant reduction of construction risk - delays and cost overruns,
estimated t o affect up t o 30% of publicly procured projects; (b) for existing (brownfield) projects,
improved quality of service and better value for money, by leveraging the know-how of private sector
operators. Additional arguments for PPP include:

77

Appendix 2
Better risk allocation: well structured PPPs can substantially transfer project risk to the private
sector (construction, traffic, environmental.. .etc.).
More accurate project costing for better decision-making: publicly-procured projects often benefit
from embedded subsidies that are seldom accounted for in the decision-makingprocess.
0

Lower transaction costs for grantors: PPPs replace multiple contracts (construction, management,
financing., .etc.) with a single concession agreement.
Lower total project costs: greenfield PPP projects avoid significant upfront cash outlays while
brownfield ones allow the monetization o f existing assets. Depending on the Government’s
discount and reinvestment rates, this can lead to lower project cost (on an NPV basis).

53.
Empirical studies conducted by the Bank and other institutions (OECD, 2007) suggest that
as a Low Medium Income Country in the M E N A region, Morocco should allocate around 9.2
percent of its yearly GDP to meet the infrastructure demand needs” o f its economy and society.
This effort i s required to expand and upgrade the existing infrastructure stock as well as to ensure its
adequate maintenance. Expanding, upgrading and maintaining infrastructure systems i s made necessary
by demographic and urbanization trends as well as by the transformation o f the economy. Assuming a
2008 GDP of MDH689 billion”, we estimate that Morocco will need to invest about MDH64 billion’*
yearly in infrastructure. Available information in Morocco suggests that the public and private sectors
This represents approximately 75
currently invest around MDH48 billion a year in infra~tructure’~.
percent o f what i s needed to sustain growth prospects. Therefore, Morocco faces an infrastructure
investment gap o f about MDH20 billion a year, and the question facing the authorities i s how such a gap
can be bridged without deepening public deficits?
Given: (i) the country’s substantial infrastructure needs; and (ii) the need to maintain fiscal balance, the
government can significantly benefit from a well-designed PPP initiative. I t would allow to:
Avoid the large upfront costs of greenfield infrastructure projects (e.g.: in power generation);
0

Optimize the use o f public resources: not all projects are appropriate for private participation. A
PPP initiative would allow the government to focus public spending on essential but none
commercially viable projects.
Reap the efficiency gains the private sector can provide: these would be decoupled from the
government’s efforts to upgrade/modernize the country’s public sector.
In the social sectors, stepping up Government’s efforts: PPPs in education or health allow the
government to focus i t s resources on the provision of education and health services, not the
construction and operation o f facilities.
Improve the management and maintenance o f certain public infrastructure facilities, and reduce
the distortionary role of State-ownership in certain markets. For example, access o f firms to

supply and sanitation. This assessment excludes other important economic and social infrastructure.

This represents approximately half o f the total public investment projected in 2009.
13
This ballpark estimate i s computed with data from the Ministry o f Finance but should be treated with caution, as a more robust
analysis i s needed to estimate current infrastructure spending in Morocco. At first glance, available data shows that the public
sector represents around 90% o f infrastructure investments in Morocco.

industrial land remains a key constraint to business in Morocco, despite the public investments in
numerous industrial zones across the country (Morocco i s the middle-income country where this
access problem appears as the most severe in business surveys-figure
A2.9). Expanding
successful PPP transactions to more industrial zones should help reduce this constraint.

Unlocking the potential of PPPs: contours o f a Morocco PPP Initiative

54.
T o unlock the potential of PPPs, addressing the above constraints i s key. However, PPPs
also require learning by doing and accumulation o f experiences. With this in mind, a dual-track
approach could be thought of:
A ) In the short-term: the establishment of a small PPP screening unit, at the level o f the Ministry o f
Finance to jump-start the. This unit’s mission would be to identify straightforward, plain vanilla
projects that are appropriate for PPP financing, in coordination with the implementing ministries
or agencies. In this first phase, the objective should be to restrict public financing only to those
projects that really warrant it. This unit can also centralize some essential support functions
(contracting o f financial, legal and technical advisors).
B) In the medium to lone; term: the central PPP unit’s role and ambition may be extended further to
include: (a) long-term infrastructure needs assessment for better planning; (b) PPP Policy
formulation, i.e., the definition o f criteria for identifying projects suitable for PPP financing; (c)
central support role for implementing agencies and municipalities; (d) identification and
implementation o f the required reforms o f the country’s regulatory and fiscal frameworks to
enable PPPs and (e) expanding the PPP frontier, in particular to the social sectors.

World Bank engagement:
55.
World Bank support to PPP initiatives could be sector-specific and part of a project o r
AAA activity (in the infrastructure sectors for example). I t could also be transversal and focused on
helping the government o f Morocco address the PPP agenda in a comprehensive manner, through a
central PPP unit. Specifically, if the government decides to systematize the use o f PPPs in certain sectors,
the World Bank could support it via:

address these needs. I t would explore strategic infrastructure projects that could be developed
through PPPs, and provide recommendations for policy, legal and institutional changes to allow
for the development o f more PPPs.
A similar assessment o f potential leads for PPP operations, but in the social sectors (health or
education).
0

Technical Assistance to build capacity at the level o f the central government (in particular in the
Ministry o f Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Interior), or in sectoral ministries (like
transport or energy) to improve the ability o f the public sector to identify opportunities for PPP,
negotiate their terms, conduct economic analysis, supervise the service delivery and the partner’s
compliance with the terms o f the PPP transaction. For example, in the Solid Waste sector, it could
build on the ongoing pilot, initiated with the Solid Waste DPL, to support the preparation o f a
draft National standard bidding documents. The technical assistance could also take the form o f
support to specific projects or transactions, in the upstream analysis. I t could also include support
to improving the PPP legal and regulatory framework.

IFC engagement:
56.
The growth o f PPP transactions in Morocco offers many opportunities for I F C to play a

role either as an investor in specific projects, or as an advisor. More specifically, investment leads
have been identified in a few areas and may concretize over the CPS period:
0

In the energy sector, the anticipated liberalization o f the power sector and in particular, plans for
independent power generation and renewable energy could present key opportunities for IFC.
Examples o f projects that could potentially benefit from PPP transactions include the thermal
power station o f Terfaya, the potential Liquid natural gas terminal, the regionalization o f the
electricity market with the development o f independent power production or power purchase
agreement arrangements. Moreover, the anticipated development of wind power-generation
plants could offer opportunities to extend the concession projects realized in the North of
Morocco and in the Essaouira plant.
In the education sector, opportunities could develop in the health and education sectors if the
legal framework i s reformed. Specifically, the higher education sector could offer important
opportunities for IFC investments, but important legal and regulatory constraints remain which
limit the creation o f private universities that can offer officially recognized diplomas in Morocco.

0

0

In the transport sector, opportunities are also likely to arise from the large government-led
infrastructure projects such as the Tanger Med Port.
In the water sector, new concessions are expected in a number o f cities (like Oujda or Beni
Mellal), to extend the experiences of Tangiers, Casablanca and Rabat. BOTSare also expected for
desalination plants. A l l should offer opportunities for IFC investments, in particular in terms of
sub-national lending.

57.
Finally, the recent reforms o f the regulatory framework for solid waste management will
offer opportunities for I F C support to PPPs in certain cities for new waste management plants. The
IFC could also provide advisory support in specific PPP transactions along the lines o f IFC’s successful
PPP advisory transaction in the irrigation sector in the Guerdane region in Morocco.

Introduction

1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) reviews the World Bank
Group’s program in Morocco for the FY06-09 period. It reviews implementation of the planned
program set out in the CAS document, as well as new activities introduced during the period. The
flexibility introduced in implementation made important contributions to Morocco’s development. The
experience of implementation provides lessons which inform the new Country Partnership Strategy for
FY10-13I4.
11.

National Development Objectives and CAS Relevance

2.
The CAS was based on government’s reform agenda that had been formulated in 2002.
This agenda focused on employment-generating growth and the reduction of poverty and exclusion. It
had the following focus areas: (i) continue implementing the ongoing Public Administration Reform
Program; (ii) reduce geographic disparities and the rural-urban divide; (iii) capitalize on the rapid
emergence of a restructured and resilient financial sector; (iv) intensify efforts to attract foreign direct
investments in manufacturing, tourism and agro-industry; (v) continue to focus on the successful
convergence program with the European Union; and (vi) mitigate rising social pressure linked with urban
exclusion and rural isolation and expand the benefits of growth to the population at large, particularly the
young with school degrees and those living in extreme poverty.

3.
The CAS reflected broad consultation with government at central and decentralized level,
academia, private sector, civil society representatives and development partners.
These
consultations continued during implementation, fostering an environment of adaptation o f the program to
evolving national priorities. They became a vehicle for communication and knowledge exchange, in
particular with civil society, including with the opening of Public Information Centers outside of Rabat.
The CAS was founded on four pillars: (i)improve competitiveness and the investment climate; (ii)
increase access to basic services for poor and marginalized people; (iii)improve the educational system;
and (iv) strengthen the management of water resources, access to drinking water and sanitation services.
Governance was the main cross-cutting theme in support of the institutional reforms needed to improve
the transparency, accountability and inclusiveness in the public sector.
4.
Morocco’s development agenda took on a broader mandate when a new government was
appointed in October 2007. I t s vision was one of faster progress on growth, poverty eradication and
social conditions. Over the following 18 months, it identified sectoral and structural constraints,
developed a set of sector strategies, and allocated budgetary funding to these priorities. The result i s an

The CAS Progress Report” sought to align the program with the government’s new vision.
It confirmed that the overall CAS objectives and pillars remained relevant and aligned with the country’s
program. It highlighted the importance of selectivity and flexibility and adapted the program to meet
Government requests in various sectors. This led to increased interest in engaging the Bank Group,
leading to an increase in the number and diversity of requests to complement the government’s own
resources and those of other development partners. Among the new activities supported by the Bank
were the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), solid waste reform, energy sector reform,
initial work on climate change, and early work to introduce conditional cash transfers in education. These
areas have become major opportunities to contribute to national development outcomes through both
lending and non-lending activities. The mix of lending and non-lending interventions adapted
accordingly. Lending was increasingly channeled through budget support, with Development Policy
Loans (DPLs) reaching 67 percent of total financing over the implementation period. Programmatic ESW
was used to provide the analysis underpinning the reforms supported by the DPLs. IFC adapted i t s
program to respond to the new opportunities, particularly notable being a large increase in investments
from $4 million in 2002-2004 to $244 million in 2008.
6.
The I F C also significantly stepped up its activities in Morocco, achieving a turnaround o f its
investments and reaching record levels o f commitments. Commitments were distributed through
commercial banks, microfinance, wastewater local public utilities, and investment funds for SMEs and
property development in low income housing. On the advisory side, IFC has broadened i t s efforts, by
supporting the government’s landmark PPP in the irrigation sector, and has been active in supporting the
business environment by developing commercial mediation, business simplification and improving credit
information infrastructure.
7.
I n summary, while the document was not formulated as a Country Partnership Strategy,
implementation of the strategy saw adoption of the essential features of a CPS. It laid the foundation
for a genuine partnership approach that emphasized broad consultations as an input to priority setting, the
flexibility to adapt the program to new country conditions and government priorities, and commitment to
improved responsiveness and diligence, as well as improved coordination on respective processes.

Summary of World Bank Group Program

8.
During the CAS period July 2005 to June 2009, the Bank delivered ten lending operations
for a total o f $1.127 billion, an average of $280 million per year (see Table A5.1 below). This was
within the CAS proposed financial envelope of $250-350 million per year. The Bank’s lending included
six DPLs and four investment projects, with the DPL proportion representing two thirds of overall new
commitments. Total disbursements were $1,088 million, averaging $272 million per fiscal year. The
overall quality o f the portfolio remained strong with problem projects accounting for less than 10 percent.
9.
The Bank Group’s program remained focused on the four pillars o f the CAS. It was adapted
to respond to changes in the Government’s program and choice of lending instruments. The Bank
delivered new lending operations in each pillar, with the exception of pillar 3 where the Basic Education
project (PARSEM) had just been approved in FY05 before the CAS was finalized. New areas of
engagement - energy, solid waste, the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) - were added
to the lending program, building on other elements of Bank engagement in these sectors. For example,
the government re-engaged in energy sector dialogue with the World Bank in 2005, which led to Bank

support for a technical assistance program in energy, and subsequently led to the formulation o f a
comprehensive energy sector reform program. In this context, the energy DPL (FY07) and an energy
investment lending operation (FY08) were approved and became a core part of the Bank’s support to the
first CAS pillar of increasing Morocco’s competitiveness. Similarly, at the end of 2006, the government
embarked on a new reform program in Solid Waste Management. Bank support encompassed AAA, trust
funds, regional reports and data gathering. A Solid Waste DPL was delivered in FY09, the first o f i t s
kind in the sector for the Bank. Support for the MDH was introduced into the program as it became the
main poverty-focused program of the government and involved multi-donor support to i t s
implementation. The INDH i s fully aligned with the second CAS pillar o f increasing access to basic
services by the poor and marginalized.

Relevant experience for its demand-driven, bottom-up community approach had already been collected
and lessons learned under the Bank-supported Social Development Agency project (implemented from
2003-2008) and through the two rural projects - Irrigation-Based Community Development project
(implemented between 2002 and 2008) and Rainfed Agriculture Development (under implementation
since 2003).
The choice o f lending instrument evolved, with increased demand for development policy
10.
lending (DPL) reflecting both the policy-nature o f the reform program and the government’s
financing preferences. The PARL, series, supporting public administration reform, remained a
cornerstone o f the Bank’s DPL support. The positive experience from the Housing DPL (approved just
before the CAS was finalized in FY05) and the Financial Sector DPL (FY06) further solidified the role o f
DPLs in the Bank’s financial support. The CAS-proposed investment lending project in.the water sector
evolved to become a DPL and the new DPLs for energy and solid waste were approved. Overall, the
larger use of the DPL instrument was based on long-term dialogue and solid analytical work, often in the
form o f complex programmatic ESW (see below for discussion on AAA). DPLs allowed for a deeper and
more productive dialogue on difficult reforms, and aligned Bank resource transfers to concrete actions
required to launch or continue reforms in each sector. DPLs were supplemented by new investments in
infrastructure, notably in supporting rural roads, water supply and sanitation.

11.
The AAA program comprised 59 pieces of analytical work of which 35 were economic and
sector work and 24 were technical assistance activities. The flexible, on-demand approach facilitated
responsiveness to key areas emerging in the dialogue, analysis o f new priorities and complex crosscutting themes, and knowledge services that were aligned with the requests o f the client. At times, this
approach came at the cost of selectivity and resulted in some fragmentation. Technical assistance and
policy advice efforts have been most of the time demand-driven and o f high quality, although not always
timely.
12.
I F C has played an important role in Morocco during the CAS period with its presence on
the ground for advisory services, i t s entrance into the local capital markets, and a record
investment program. During the CAS period, IFC’s portfolio expanded substantially, in sharp contrast
with the previous CAS. In FY09, IFC’s total committed portfolio in Morocco reached US$272.5 million
in 12 companies, making it the fifth largest exposure in the MENA region. From zero commitments
between 2002 and 2005, IFC’s investment activities started to increase sharply in 2006 and reached
US$244 million in FY08. These commitments, ranging from investments in banks, microfinance
institutions, water & wastewater utilities, investment funds for small and medium companies, to
construction sector and property development in low income housing, were the result o f IFC’s refocus on
investment activities and in line with the WBG strategic objectives.
13.
Supporting the financial sector (Pillar I)has been the centerpiece o f IFC’s strategy and
program, particularly as it supports the development o f SMEs and financial services to the poorer
segment o f the population. IFC has been active in supporting investment funds bringing much needed
capital and expertise to over 25 high-growth small and medium companies in Morocco. IFC has also
worked with leading Moroccan banks to help them develop profitable SME banking operations. IFC also
undertook various initiatives to develop the country’s financial and credit information infrastructure, and
helped establish jointly with the Central Bank a best practice private credit bureau. IFC’s support to the
microfinance sector has helped over 500,000 small borrowers’ access much needed financial services.
Moreover, IFC’s investment in BMCE Bank, has helped strengthen the bank’s capital and expand in 11
Sub-Saharan African countries. In infrastructure, IFC played a key role in advising the government on
structuring and implementing the first public-private partnership globally for irrigation, and helped
mobilize commercial funding for local water & wastewater utilities. On the Treasury front, IFC issued a
bond in Morocco denominated in dirhams - a transaction that was the first domestic bond offering by a

85

Appendix 3

multilateral institution in Africa as well as in the Middle East - thus contributing to the broadening o f the
financial markets in the country.

IV.

Progress on CAS Pillars and Bank Group Contribution

14.
The CAS Results Framework provides a structure for assessing the contribution of the
Bank Group (see Appendix 1). Implementation experience yielded a number o f lessons which are being
reflected in the new CPS. The four pillars were underpinned by 12 outcomes and 112 indicators.
Experience has shown that this framework was too specific and, in some cases, lacked sufficient realism.
A more appropriate framework would allow for greater flexibility both over time and to respond to new
needs and opportunities. I t would also acknowledge that Moroccan institutions and stakeholders are the
principal drivers o f country development outcomes, as the Bank i s a relatively modest sized player in this
context, and that Bank performance i s better evaluated by a sense o f “contribution” to results rather than
firm “attribution”.
15.
Morocco made substantial progress in many areas during the CAS period. In particular, it
made progress under Pillar 1 (improve competitiveness and the investment climate), Pillar 4 (improve
water management and access to water and sanitation), and - to a lesser extent - Pillar 2 (increase access
to basic services by the poor and marginalized). More modest progress was made under pillar 3 (improve
education system’s efficiency). Morocco’s achievements under each CAS pillar are discussed below and
the Bank’s contribution i s assessed.

Pillar I:Improve competitiveness and the investment climate

16.
This pillar had five focus areas: (i)maintain macroeconomic stability; (ii)increase efficiency of
public administration; (iii)improve the investment climate; (iv) increase efficiency of the financial sector
and access to finance of businesses; and (v) increase competitiveness of small and medium-sized
agribusinesses.
A.

Maintain macroeconomic stability during the CAS period

17.
Morocco sustained solid macroeconomic performance. Growth averaged above 5% annually
with certain sectors such as tourism, telecommunications, finance, insurance, and construction recording
levels of between 6 and 10 percent per year on average over the past four years. Since 2005, Morocco
maintained sound fiscal policies and continued to address fiscal risks, leading to the consolidation of
public finances. As a result, the budget ran surpluses in 2007 and 2008 and again in the first half o f 2009
(averaging 0.3 percent of GDP), and central government debt steadily declined to 47 percent of GDP in
2008 from 62 percent in 2005. In addition, it pursued appropriate monetary policy geared toward
maintaining low and stable inflation (an average 2.5 percent since 2005) and enhanced financial sector
supervision. The external position i s solid, with the current account in surplus for six consecutive years
over the period 2001-06 and in quasi-balance in 2007. Public finances continue to be well managed with
effective fiscal reforms pursued over the past few years. The most striking structural change was the
shrinking o f the share of the primary sector by 3.5 percentage points of GDP at factor cost to reach an
average of 15.7 percent over the period 2001-08, a share that i s still high compared to leading transition
economies. As a result, GDP growth and macroeconomic stability became more resilient to the variability
of the agricultural sector. The services sector grew by 4.3 percentage points to average 56.1 percent of
GDP, driven by the telecommunication sector and other services provided to businesses and households.
Manufacturing has declined to an average 16.5 percent of GDP since 2001, down from 18.8 percent in the
1990s.
18.
The Bank provided analytical support as it engaged in continued monitoring o f the overall
macroeconomic situation in close coordination with the IMF. Medium term issues have been
nourished with a series of formal and informal AAA and TA activities. A CEM on Morocco’s growth
challenges was delivered in 2006; a TA on trade issues, still on-going, has strengthened inter alia
Government capacity to evaluate the impact of planned and on-going bilateral trade agreements; a series
of in-depth policy notes, informally shared with Government, have been developed to guide the overall
economic dialogue and the preparation of the new CPS. In addition, issues of specific relevance to the
macroeconomic stability of the country have been addressed in the sectoral policy dialogue developed
around the design and implementation of DPLs and related accompanying TAs. For example, issues of
public sector HR reform and wage bill management have been tackled by the PARL series and the
associated TA (programmatic ESW). Finally, the Bank’s Treasury Department provided advisory
services in debt management, as Morocco was one of the earliest clients to sign a Master Derivatives
Agreement with the IBRD.
B.

Increased efficiency o f the public administration

19.
Government carried out a broad range o f reforms that led to improvements to the efficiency
o f the public administration. Civil service reform contributed to a reduction of the wage bill from 1 1.7
% in 2005 to 10.2 % of GDP in 2008. Measures included a voluntary retirement program, a limit to new
recruitment, cancellation of vacancies, and geographic and sectoral refocusing of human resources.
Government established a Medium Term Expenditure Framework in 9 ministries, together with the
dissemination of a methodological guide. Five additional ministries are expected to complete their
MTEFs by the end of 2009. Limited progress was made on deconcentration, with the creation of ad hoc

87

Appendix 3
functions at decentralized level and performance-based contracts with external services at regional level
in a few sectoral ministries. Important progress was made in introducing an e-Government and
information society framework, and high impact measures introduced on-line administration. Successful
e-Government applications were developed in the area o f custom processing (the "Badr" platform), eprocurement, tax reporting and payments, and externalization o f key IT processes.

20.
Since 2002 the World Bank, the EU and the African Development Bank have supported
Government with a mix o f financing and advisory activities. The key objectives of the public
administration reform program (PARAP) are: (a) improving Government efficiency in the management o f
budget resources through greater transparency, accountability, and performance measurement; (b)
improving Government efficiency in the management o f human resources; and (c) consolidating and
controlling civil service payroll evolution and (d) developing e-Government. A series o f three
Development Policy loans, called Public Administration Reform Loans (PARLs), has accompanied the
reform process (FY05, FY06, FY08) with PARL IV scheduled for FY 10. The PARLs mostly addressed
results (outputs) in terms of reform implemented and modernized tools adopted by the various public
entities, mostly on a pilot basis. A programmatic ESW (P-ESW) was delivered in parallel with its focus
designed to accompany the reforms pursued under the PARL agenda. The PARLs are considered to have
been satisfactory on meeting their objectives (June 2009 ICR for PARLs I and I1 and the on-going
assessment o f PARL 111). Government showed commitment to implementing the program and donor
coordination among the Bank, EU and AfDB was strong throughout and played a major role in program
success. The Index o f the Quality o f government o f the Bank's Economic Development Prospects report,
which i s a percentile rank relative to other countries o f the world, was 74 in 2007 (100 meaning best
environment) compared to a rating o f 58 in 2000. See Table A3.3 below for outcomes.

Improve the Investment Climate

2 1.
Morocco experienced good investment performance. Gross investment reached 36.3 percent
o f GDP in 2008 and FDI increased by 8 percent per year over the last five years, reaching $4.5 billion or
6 percent o f GDP in 2007. Most o f the FDI happened in five sectors: telecommunications (22 percent o f
the total), new industry sectors (20.9 percent), tourism (17.8 percent), real estate (16,5percent), and
banking (5.9 percent). Most o f these sectors posted high growth rates over the period 2001-08, of which
88

Appendix 3

telecommunications (up 12.4 percent), real estate and construction (up 7.6 percent), financial services (up
6.9 percent), and mechanical and electrical industries (up 6 percent). Liberalizing transport and energy,
investments in transport infrastructure, strengthening the financial sector, and selectively opening the
trade regime have further contributed to the diversification o f the economy, especially since 2004. This
progress, together with good macro management, contributed to Morocco achieving investment grade
status in 2007, which further reinforced the confidence o f investors, both domestic and foreign.

22.
Important investment climate reforms have been introduced over the past four years. The
corporate governance framework for joint stock companies (socie'te's anonymes) was reformed, an
arbitration and mediation law was introduced, and the corporate tax rate was decreased. The business
simplification project with the Regional Investment Center was instituted in Casablanca in 2007, with
support from IFC, which helped accelerate business start-up procedures. As part of the decentralized
management o f investment, powers were vested in regional Walis in relation to consensual
transfers/conveyance or rentals of State-owned land for investment projects; a procedural handbook and a
national committee for investment-related procedures were set up to simplify these procedures. Some
progress was made on the legal authorization to freely enter into contracts for a limited duration, and on
the review o f the 2003 Labor Code, applicable to dismissals based on technological, structural, or
economic reasons.
There remains a need to increase the impact of reforms. In particular, the business
23.
environment continues to present challenges, especially in those areas-like regulatory reform-that
require coordination across public agencies, and where a gap remains between the laws as they appear on
the books and how they're applied to individual investors. Morocco's ranking in the annual Doing
Business report i s largely static, at 128'hglobally, and 13th under the Middle East and North Africa region
Doing Business ranking.

24.
The Bank Group provided analytic support to the most urgent reforms in transport,
logistics, fiscal reform and the investment climate. Analytical work included a study on Land Reform
which identified regulations in industrial land as one o f the issues to be addressed and two Investment
Climate Assessments (ICAs), in 2005 and in 2008. Debate on Morocco's Doing Business ranking led to a
request from the main business organization (CGEM) to reopen negotiations with unions to bring more
flexibility to labor regulations. The Bank was asked to provide technical assistance to organize an
efficient public-private mechanism for identifying reform needs, and support the establishment o f a
national committee to monitor and facilitate reforms among different ministries. IFC developed a
sizeable advisory program to strengthen the investment climate and support private sector development.
I t s advisory program focused on (a) promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to improving
the business environment - with the Ministry o f Justice; (b) helping identify public-private partnerships in
key infrastructure sectors - with the Ministry o f Finance; (c) simplifying business creations starting with
the City o f Casablanca; and (d) strengthening credit information and SME finance, through the
establishment of a private credit bureau - with the Central Bank. Overall, the Bank Group's program was
considered to have made a satisfactory contribution. See also Table A3.4.

Increase Efficiency of Financial Sector and Access to Financing for Businesses

25.
The financial sector became more stable and liberalized during the past four years. The
Ministry o f Finance and Central Bank exercised strong leadership throughout. The Central Bank - Bank
AI-Maghrib (BAM) - i s equipped with modern surveillance mechanisms. Banking supervision i s largely
compliant with a majority o f Base1 I1 principles. The supervision o f insurance companies, not covered by
the BAM, i s also largely compliant with international principles. There have been advances in capital
market supervision. The banking sector i s stable, profitable, sufficiently capitalized, and more resilient to
shocks as indicated by the significant decrease in the share in total credit o f nonperforming loans from
18.3% in 2004 to less than 6% in 2008. Since 2008, Bank AI-Maghrib and other supervisory agencies
have embarked on a program aimed at strengthening national financial stability, a priority highlighted by
the 2007 FSAP. The financial sector has been marginally affected by the global financial crisis owing t o
i t s l o w exposure to external shocks.
26.
I n FY06, a Financial Sector DPL ($200 million) helped strengthen the legal and institutional
environment for financial intermediation and risk management, and to increase the private sector’s
participation in the provision of financial services. All targets o f the operation were met and the
January 2008 ICR rated the operation satisfactory for Development Objectives and highly satisfactory for
Implementation Progress. It concluded that the government’s performance was Highly Satisfactory. The
new framework has provided more autonomy to the Central Bank in conducting monetary policy and
banking supervision, while including a strengthened mandate to intervene in financially troubled
commercial banks. I t broadened the scope o f banking supervision to cover institutions (CDG,

90

Appendix 3

microfinance, postal services and associations) previously excluded from regulatory oversight. Progress
on regulation and supervision o f the insurance sector was less significant. The Bank and the IMF carried
out a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) review in 2007 which underpinned the reforms
supported by the DPL. The government reforms supported by the DPL and FSAP have reduced financial
sector vulnerabilities, especially as a result o f the restructuring o f ailing public specialized financial
institutions. Concerns over stability have eased and policy attention has now been directed increasingly
to core financial system development issues. The formerly state owned banks are in an advanced state o f
restructuring and are in compliance with prudential requirements. They have redefined their strategy,
business plan and market niche. The share o f government involvement in the banking sector has dropped
from 40% in 2002 to 23% by 2008. On April 2009, the four authorities with responsibilities for the
financial stability o f Morocco’s financial system (Ministry of Economy and Finance, Central Bank,
Securities Ethics Council and Department o f Insurance and Social Welfare) participated in a financial
crisis simulation exercise sponsored by FIRST Initiative and the World Bank. The exercise was designed
to test how the authorities would work together to manage a potential systemic crisis within their financial
system.

27.
The IFC has been very active in banking, micro-finance and investment funds covering.
This included (i) the establishment o f the Credit Bureau; (ii)advisory work to Morocco’s microfinance
sector as part o f i t s investment packages; and (iii) support to the expansion o f BMCE Bank into 11 SubSaharan countries, therefore contributing to strengthen South-South Cooperation. IFC has also been
active on the Treasury front. In FY05, it issued a bond in Morocco denominated in dirhams. This
transaction was the first domestic bond offering by a multilateral institution in the country and in the
MENA region. The transaction contributed to develop the domestic capital market, provide a new top
quality investment opportunity, introduce “best practices” in the domestic capital market, and provide
Morocco with a market visibility throughout the region. The 7-year bond o f US$I 17 million equivalent
was distributed to more than 20 Moroccan institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual
funds and pension funds. IFC also financed several investment projects per year between FY06-FY09
which provided critical credit financing to micro-finances institutions or delivered equity financing:
US$3.3 million partial credit guarantee to Fondep, a microfinance institution, allowing it to
mobilize US$6.6 million in local currency funding;
US$ 12.3 million in a regional private equity fund, Maghreb Private Equity Fund 11, targeting
SMEs in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia;
US$22 million financing package to Jaida, Morocco’s newly established microfinance fund. The
financing i s in the form of 100% sovereign-linked guarantee to allow Jaida to raise subordinated
debt in local currency from Moroccan banks;
US$2 1 million financing package to A I Amana, Morocco’s leading microfinance institution. The
local currency financing package i s composed o f subordinated and senior debt, in the form of a
local currency loan and credit guarantees. The subordinated debt was designed with the features
o f Tier I1 capital, to help the MFI increase its capital base. This i s also IFC’s first local currency
debt to a microfinance institution and also the first subordinated debt to an MFI in Morocco;
U S $ l 10 million quasi-equity investment (Upper Tier I1 capital) in BMCE Bank to support the
bank’s international expansion, namely in Sub Saharan Africa through the acquisition o f Bank o f
Africa;

91

Appendix 3

US$8 million equity investment to Capital North Africa Venture Fund, a private equity fund
managed by Capital Invest, an affiliate of a Moroccan bank, which will target high growth SMEs
primarily in Morocco;

US$7 million investment in Altermed, a private equity fund targeting SMEs with small
capitalization needs in Morocco;
28.
I n summary, Morocco’s strong commitment to carrying out financial sector reform and the
Bank Group’s support to the financial sector overall are judged as satisfactory. (See also Table

A3.5).

Increased Competitiveness of Small and Medium-sized Agribusinesses

29.
The agricultural sector in Morocco continues to face daunting challenges. I t i s characterized
by a dualistic nature with, on the one hand, a predominant rain-fed sub-sector where 70 percent o f the
poor live characterized by low productivity levels, and on the other hand, a small, competitive, exportoriented, irrigated sub-sector. Both large and small producers are constrained by inter-locking incentive,
institutional and investment environment issues. Domestic price and market liberalization i s not complete,
nor i s trade liberalization. More progress i s needed in land rights tenure systems and water management.
An institutional framework compatible with demand-driven commercial and competitive agriculture i s yet
to emerge. The recent launch o f the government’s new and ambitious four year strategic framework for
the agriculture sector (the “Plan Maroc Vert”) constitutes a concerted response to this challenge.
Government i s currently mobilizing support to this plan’s implementation, including from the World
Bank and other donors.
30.
The Bank Group contributed to this pillar through a range o f mainly cross-cutting
interventions.I6 It continued to implement two on-going integrated rural development projects - the
Development o f Rain-fed Agriculture Project (known by its French acronym DRI-MVB) and the
Irrigation Based Community Development Project (known by its French acronym DRI-PMH). The
objectives o f these projects were to improve incomes and quality o f l i f e o f rural communities and to pilot
new institutional arrangements to ensure greater community participation and integration o f sectoral
programs. The DRI-PMH was focused on irrigation and closed at the end o f 2008 and the DRI-MVB i s
focused on rain-fed agriculture and i s still under implementation. Implementation experience from these
projects demonstrates the difficulty in piloting new and innovative approaches. The community-driven
approach was a relatively novel idea to Morocco and the projects took a long time to get off the ground
and put the necessary institutional and human capacity in place. Thereafter, implementation accelerated.
l6 The

Water sector DPL focused attention on the sustainability o f hydro resources and i s described in more detail

later in this document under Pillar I V for Water Sector.

92

Appendix 3
Government agencies are demonstrating capacity to implement and fiscal decentralization i s proving to
aid the approach. The ICR o f the DRI-PMH highlights that the project demonstrated that participatory
community-based planning and integrated local level investment programming are feasible in rural areas
of Morocco and add value in terms both o f ownership and impact. The model adopted by the project has
been transferred and scaled up in other parts of the country, and nourished the design o f the nation-wide
poverty reduction program INDH (see Pillar 11). The integration of investment programs at provincial
level under the coordination of the governors has been effective although more needs to be done to ensure
the effective implementation o f these programs. Lessons learned from these two projects are furthermore
useful for the design o f the new Bank operation requested by the government to support the Plan Maroc
Vert’s component that targets the poorest rural areas and farmers.

3 1.
The Bank Group had an active AAA program. This included an ESW report on land tenure
and a policy note on the implementation o f public-private partnerships contracts to improve agricultural
competitiveness and strengthen quality and vertical integration o f four sub-sectors. The IFC, with the
Bank’s support, advised the government on structuring and implementing the first public-private
partnership (PPP) in irrigation worldwide. The project was for the construction and operation o f the
irrigated perimeter o f Guerdane (1 0,000 hectares), which aims to increase the availability of irrigation
water for about 600 citrus producers, thereby increasing and stabilizing their production and revenues,
with benefits for more than 10,000 people. IFC - with the support o f a technical assistance grant from
France’s Fonds D’etudes et D’aide au Secteur Prive and the Bank’s technical expertise in the water sector provided the government with advice on structuring and implementing the Guerdane PPP to deliver highquality, accountable and financially and environmentally sustainable public service to end-users. IFC also
worked with the government to ensure a highly competitive and transparent bidding process for the
transaction. The CAS indicators for this sub-component are shown in Table A3.6.

Energy Sector and Climate Change

32.
Although not foreseen at the time o f CAS preparation, the government resumed an active
energy sector dialogue with the World Bank, leading to unplanned program activities. The Bank
provided technical assistance focused on energy security and efficient management o f resources. It led to
the government formulation, in coordination with other development partners and particularly the EU, of
a comprehensive energy sector reform program. At a time o f fast increasing energy prices, the Bank
judged engagement important to the CAS objectives of improving competitiveness and increasing access
to services could not be achieved without due consideration to a well performing energy sector. In
response, during CAS implementation, the Bank delivered three financing operations (Energy DPL for

93

Appendix 3

$100 million, an investment loan to the electricity company ONE for $150 million, and a GEF grant for
$43 million for a solar assisted gas-fired combined cycle power plant). The DPL operation aimed to
support security of supply, while ensuring a sustainable energy future; competitivenessof energy supplies
through cost reduction and improved sector performance in order to be able to reduce subsidies, building
capacity building for strong operational and financial performance.The Bank delivered extensive analytic
work in energy sector studies, policy notes and technical assistance (P-ESW). Against the background of
the Bank analysis and support, the new government undertook a strategic study o f the sector in the fall of
2007, reformulated its energy strategy and launched new thinking on reform of the compensation
mechanism.
33.
Toward the end of the CAS period, work was initiated to address climate change issues.
The government and the Bank, in partnership with the African Development Bank, formulated an
investment plan to access resources of the Clean Technology Fund to finance investment that would
lower the carbon intensity of the Moroccan economy. Morocco i s also part of the regional investment
plan to scale-up use of solar thermal energy through the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology to
meet the energy needs of both MENA region and European countries. Regional integration i s a key
element of these different activities, as it would help achieve the objectives of enhancing energy security
and reducing the carbon intensity of the energy system.
Pillar 11: Increase access to basic services for poor and marginalized people

34.
Poverty in Morocco fell from 15.3% in 2001 to 9% in 2007”, with a decline from 25.lo/o to
14.5% in rural areas where 43% of Moroccans live. The economic recovery in the 2000s has
increased employment, reduced poverty, and improved social outcomes. Unemployment rates have been
falling constantly and were, before the crisis, at a 30-year low. However, they remain high at around 9
percent (estimated figure as of first half of 2009) and questions remain over the quality of the jobs
available. The reduction in unemployment i s due to slower labor force growth rather than employment
creation. There i s broad national consensus on the need for growth acceleration over the next decade.
Morocco will need to continue to pursue reforms that accelerate the economic transformation toward
higher value added and more diversified products and rely more on trade in world markets as an
additional source of growth.
35.
The Bank Group provided a broad range o f support to this goal. The overall assessment i s
that important achievements have been made, with clear progress on housing, poverty reduction, and
monitoring. Some of the areas of engagement proposed in the CAS - such as new integrated rural
development projects - did not materialize as planned because the country context and the Government’s
program evolved as described elsewhere in this report.
A.

Reduce the Number of Households Living in Slums by 60%

36.
This CAS goal built on the Government’s housing sector reform which started in 2003 with
support from the Bank on the sector institutional setting and needed reforms. This engagement
supported the formulation of a national strategy highlighting urban poverty reduction, cultural
conservation and local economic development objectives associated with the rehabilitation of the
medinas. In support of this national strategy, in June 2005, a $150 million, two-tranche Housing DPL
was approved whose objectives were to: (i)strengthen the institutional, regulatory and fiscal environment
for a well-functioning housing market and for the emergence of market-based solutions to the country’s
housing sector constraints; and (ii) increase the access of low-income and severely disadvantaged
” This i s the national poverty figure in Morocco. I t i s based on a poverty threshold o f $2 per day per person in new PPP which i s
a level far below what other countries at the same level o f GDP are using.

households to more affordable and higher quality housing. The ICR concluded that the project was
satisfactory in reaching its development objectives and in its implementation progress. Progress on
institutional and regulatory reforms (the project’s first development objective) was stronger than that
recorded on the second objective (focused on low-income and disadvantaged households), although both
were rated satisfactory. Government strengthened the national slum upgrading program, set aside public
land for social housing and contracted on-site infrastructure to the private sector. However,
implementation difficulties meant that just 28 percent o f slum households benefited from the low-income
housing program and 2.5% o f households are still located in slum areas (an improvement over the
project’s baseline o f 4%, but less than the ambitious CAS outcome goal o f 1.5%). The Bank’s urban
AAA work continues to analyze key issues and contribute to reforms and policies. The Bank delivered an
ESW in FY08 on Historic Cities Rehabilitation, followed by a policy workshop in FY09. I t provided
analytical support in Urban Transport and Transport Logistics, with studies and technical assistance,
including preparation o f the Urban Sector Strategy study. This has recently crystallized into a formal
request for an Urban Transport DPL that i s under preparation for FY 10 delivery.

37.

I F C invested $75 million in Mixta, a Spanish property developer focusing on affordable
housing (targeting low and middle income households) in Morocco and Africa. This was a further
innovative investment by IFC in a new area of business. IFC’s investment has provided Mixta with longterm financing to develop affordable housing namely in the North o f Morocco, addressing the unmet and
rising demand for affordable housing units, both in the lower and middle-market segments. The CAS
indicators (Table A3.7) for this sub-component capture some of the progress recorded during the CAS
period.

Road access o f the rural population exceeded the CAS target (see Table A5.8). The
38.
government’s national program for rural roads was supported in a harmonized way by the Bank and other
donors with each donor providing parallel financing, with some similarities to a SWAP approach. Donors
agreed to collectively finance investments with the government for rehabilitating 15,000 kilometers of
rural roads, providing coordinated technical and financial support, and assessing progress around an
integrated results framework. Investments in the secondary road network had a major impact on access to
services where these were coordinated with efforts in schools and water supply, building on participatory
approaches with provinces and local communities. The impact of the first phase was tangible: in villages
that gained access to an all-weather road the net enrollment ratio o f girls in primary school rose from 28%
to 68% and the price o f some staple foods declined by 50%.

After the CAS was finalized, the government asked for the Bank’s financial support to the
National Initiative for Human Development (INDH). This was delivered in the form of a SWAP loan
of US$lOO million approved in December 2006. The program targets urban neighborhoods and rural
communes with multi-sectoral public infrastructure and revenue generating investments focusing on the
most vulnerable populations. It relies on bottom up participation and planning and gives a more central
role to elected local governments and to NGOs. The INDH approach built on the experience of three
earlier Bank-funded projects - the Social Development Agency (ADS) project which piloted capacity
building and community mapping; and the two rural projects - Irrigation Based Community Development
project and the Rainfed Agricultural Development project - which support bottom-up and demand-driven
community development. Support for INDH has become a major element of the Bank’s program under
this Pillar. There has been considerable progress in INDH implementation. Poverty in the communities
targeted by INDH f e l l from 36% to 21%.
40.
The Bank delivered a substantial AAA program. It built on the Miles Report on Skills and
Employment to build consensus around the need for a reform of subsidies and the potential benefits of a
cash transfer program. Budget issues related to the food and oil crises saw further Bank analysis and
advice on reform of subsidies and the Bank provided technical and analytical support to monitor poverty.
The Bank’s P-ESW instrument helped the government generate relevant information for policy decisions,
analyze the effectiveness of policies, and expose gaps in knowledge and data. Poverty maps introduced
with Bank support changed the way poverty was perceived and addressed in Morocco, leading to more
attention to poverty pockets in rich provinces. The use of poverty maps, and the Bank’s poverty work
more generally, have helped policy makers identify and implement social programs and have
strengthened the authorities’ ability to identify and monitor poverty. This poverty mapping also shaped
the design and targeting of the INDH.

41.
The Bank’s program provided some support to the health sector, focused on advisory and
technical assistance as well as the implementationof a trust fund in support of nutrition (GAIN program).
Through this trust fund, the Bank was able to support the preparation of the national strategy on nutrition.
Health coverage and efficiency of the multiple systems in place remain major concerns and the
government assessed in the fall of 2007 that the sector was in need of a fundamental reform. Since then, a
sector strategy has since been put in place. The European Union and the African Development Bank, as
well as other bilateral donors, are heavily engaged in the health sector and, to date, the Bank’s work has
been limited to technical support to complement the engagement of other donors in the area of assisting
with the targeting of the insurance scheme (RAMED) to the poorest. This scheme has been launched as a
pilot in November 2008 so it is, therefore, still too soon to see real progress. Bank support was small in
this area.

42.
I F C carried out a pilot landmark investment aligned with the objective o f improving access
to basic services. It provided a US$21 million structured finance package to Radeej, a
water/electricity/sewage utility in El Jadida. This was the first time ever in Morocco that a public utility
could access IFC financing and marked IFC’s 1” sub-national transaction in MENA. The guarantee
provided by IFC led to the brokering of long term commercial financing for Radeej’s wastewater
upgrading program. Such long term commercial financing would likely not have been forthcoming in the
absence of IFC and attests to the catalytic financing nature of IFC. This initial transaction opened the way
for other public utilities to access long term commercial funding, for needed investments in wastewater in
three major cities (Marrakech, Kenitra and Agadir).
43.
While Table A3.8 shows the positive achievement that the CAS outcome indicator for rural
road access was exceeded, it also shows that other indicators were not aligned with the actual
delivery o f the Bank’s program. The Bank did not provide support to health insurance, the poverty
96

Appendix 3
mapping work superseded the construction o f the database for social policies, and the decentralized
institutional structure that i s pursued under the INDH i s not captured by the indicator on ministerial

Solid Waste Management

44.
Not foreseen at the time of CAS preparation, the government requested support from the
Bank for the solid waste management program it launched at the end of 2006. Only 70% o f urban
solid waste i s collected and less than 15% o f collected waste i s disposed o f in an environmentally and
socially acceptable manner. A 15-year, 3-phase program prepared in 2008 set out objectives for the
modernization o f solid waste management with specific targets. The sector had been addressed in the
CAS under the water pillar but not specifically identified as a strategic objective. The Bank has been
engaged in a long-term program o f support that encompassed AAA, trust funds, regional reports and data
gathering. Following a government request, the Bank approved i t s first DPL in the solid waste sector in
March 2009 ($132 million). This path-breaking operation built upon the policy dialogue and advisory
role o f the previous five years. It focuses on improving the governance o f the sector, enhancing
sustainability o f services, building public-private partnerships and mainstreaming environmental and
social priorities. It also assists Morocco to take advantage o f the Clean development mechanism and gain
access to the carbon finance market through decreasing the emissions o f green house gases from open
landfills. A second DPL i s planned as part o f the new CPS.
Pillar 111: Improve the Efficiency o f the Education System
45.
Government devoted attention to primary and higher education for the past several years in
response to high geographic, demographic and gender inequalities. Access to education at all levels
has been expanded, with national net enrollment rates for primary education, middle school and upper
secondary all increasing. This increased enrollment has placed pressure on higher education and has led to
a substantial increase in student enrollment (about 25% between 1993 and 2006). Good progress has also
been made in ensuring equitable access to education for young children. The gender parity index in

97

Appendix 3

primary education between urban boys and rural girls aged 6-11 has narrowed from 1.5 to 1 in the past
decade. Nevertheless, serious enrollment disparities persist as children proceed through the education
system. Illiteracy rates remain high in rural areas and among women, unemployment among high school
and even university graduates remains high, and there i s a perceived disconnect between economic
growth and standards of quality in all levels of the education system. With the goal of facilitating a
comprehensive assessment of progress in education, the two CAS components under this pillar are
grouped together.
A.

Increase Access to and Quality o f Basic Education and
Increase Graduation and Employment Rates o f High School, Higher Education and
Vocational Training Students

B.

46.
There has been progress in improving access. The national net enrollment rates for primary
education have increased from 52.4% (1990-1991) to 93.5% (2007-2008). Between 2000 and 2008, net
enrollment in middle school increased from 17.5% to 43.4%, and in upper secondary education from
6.1% to 17.5%. Education completion rates have progressed but the prospects to meet the MDGs remain
uncertain. Primary school completion rate has increased from 57.8% in 2004 to 70.8% in 2007. The
disparity between girls and boys remains an issue. It i s not clear whether, at the current pace, universal
primary school completion can be achieved by 2015. The completion o f middle school education has
improved (from 43.7% in 2004 to 78.6% in 2007), with rates for boys (74.9%) lower in comparison to
that for girls (82.9%). Morocco has been less successful in balancing the observed increase in enrollments
with the required education quality and skills improvement. The internal efficiency of the education
system i s low at all levels. High drop-out and repetition rates are prevalent at most levels. Learning
achievements and external efficiency are problematic. Ensuring the financial sustainability of schooling
expansion and strengthening the overall sector’s governance are challenging.
47.
The Bank supported improvement of education access and standards, in particular through
a Primary Education loan (PARSEM 1). This project was approved in FY05 and implemented
throughout the CAS period (it closed in June 2009). I t was implemented along with financing from
several other donors. The principal objective o f PARSEM i s to support government efforts to provide
basic education and improving quality o f that education to all children ages six to fourteen in a financially
sustainable manner. To meet this objective, PARSEM contributed to the establishment of practices,
mechanisms, and approaches that will improve the education system on an ongoing basis. As well as
contributing to the enrollment outcomes mentioned above, concrete efforts were made through the project
to improve the governance of the sector by addressing fiduciary weaknesses, including with training in
procurement and financial management to staff of the AREFs (regional academies recently instituted) and
diagnosis on evaluation systems within the Ministry of Education. These include the decentralization
process (AREFs are gradually playing a key role in reform implementation), the strengthening of the inservice training program and the execution of learning evaluation.

48.
I n June 2008, the Education Emergency Plan (Plan d’Urgence 2009-2012) was finalized
which lays out an ambitious reform program that underscores government’s prioritization of the
education sector in Morocco’s development. Support to the preparation of this plan was provided
during preparation by donors engaged in the education sector (including the Bank through PARSEM).
Since June 2008, donors have been delivering their financial support to the Plan d’Urgence and the Bank
has a DPL under preparation in FY 10 in support of this.
49.
The Bank supported the Ministry of Education in putting in place a conditional cash
transfer program in rural primary education. Starting with technical discussions in early 2007, to the
launch o f the program in the fall of 2008, the Bank has been providing technical assistance through a
series of short technical notes and regular missions, to answer specific needs expressed by the Ministry of

98

Appendix 3
Education and the Higher Education Council at each step o f the pilot implementation. From the
preliminary design phase, to setting-up the whole information infrastructure and operational procedures,
the Bank provided just-in-time support for a pilot program that was set-up in record time by the
government. This was not an activity planned in the C A S but flexibility and responsiveness to an urgent
and strategic demand by the Government allowed the Bank to play a key role in setting-up this important
initiative. Today, the program called Tayssir benefits more than 40,000 households (close to 90,000
students) in 5 regions and 266 schools. It has the infrastructure o f a best-practice conditional cash transfer
program, and i s subject to a rigorous impact evaluation that i s being conducted with the support o f the
Bank. As o f September 2009, government i s considering the extension o f Tayssir to 6 new regions, to
benefit 160,000 new households. The originality o f the Tayssir pilot i s also that it i s designed to offer the
government a very reliable impact evaluation at the end o f the second year o f the program. The evaluation
has been designed using the most recent techniques by the Poverty Action Lab o f MITI8, in collaboration
and with the financial support o f various trust funds mobilized by the Bank.

50.
The CAS outcome indicators as shown in Table A3.9 below do not represent well the impact
o f the government’s program and the Bank’s contribution. In some cases, the goals were unrealistic
and overly ambitious. In others, there were no baselines provided, making it difficult to assess progress.
Furthermore, the outcome indicators did not match the goals in the results framework o f the Bank’s
education project (PARSEM) which were more realistic and should have been used as the basis for
assessing the Bank’s performance since they are directly linked to the Bank’s project. It’s also important

to emphasize the difficulties here between attribution o f outcomes and contribution to outcomes: the Bank
i s just one o f many development actors in the education system, and finances a relatively small amount o f
the overall education program, so it i s inappropriate to apply a standard o f attribution o f outcomes to the
Bank’s program.

Pillar IV: Improve Water (Resources) Management and Access to Potable/Drinking Water and
Sanitation Services

5 1.
Morocco’s water policies have long focused on securing scarce and unevenly distributed
resources for urban and agricultural needs. It has done this through the development of dams, large
scale irrigation perimeters, and urban water supply systems. While creating solid infrastructure and
capable institutions, this supply-driven focus also led to neglecting parallel investments in demand
management, water supply in rural areas, sanitation and pollution control. Starting in 1995 with the
promulgation of the Water Law, government has sought to bring about better resource management and
protection, as well as improved access and efficiency in the water sector. Reform progress has been slow
and Morocco’s water sector - understood as encompassing resource management, irrigation, and water
supply and sanitation (WSS) - remains in transition towards a more efficient resource management and
service. For all its infrastructure achievements, the sector faces pressing challenges, including large scale
degradation and depletion of water resources, substantial gaps in water supply and sanitation coverage,
and generally inefficient water usage. Such water-related constraints contribute to limiting economic and
social development opportunities across Morocco.

52.
Building on three decades o f water project partnerships and renewed policy dialogue since
2002, the government and the Bank agreed that the water sector would remain central to their
partnership. The water pillar of the CAS was conceived in this context. As highlighted in Tables
A5.10, A5.11 and A5.12, there progress has been made. During the course of CAS implementation, as
the government showed an increasing preference for DPLs, it requested the Bank to provide DPL support
to the water sector, to complement the investment projects underway or planned. In October 2005, the
government confirmed that the reform program would seek advances in sector governance, resource
management, irrigation, and water supply and sanitation (WSS), while ensuring continuity with previous
sector reforms and adjustment operations. The DPL was designed as a series of four loans
(Programmatic-DPL, or P-DPL) to sustain the incremental implementation over several years of the
government’s broad reform program. The reforms aimed at bringing about more efficient and sustainable
water management and service delivery. The program addressed central issues in sector governance and
financing, while supporting sub-sectoral reforms in resource management, irrigation, and water supply
and sanitation. It was guided by principles o f integrated resources management, as well as demand and
performance management. Goals and key measures included: (i)strengthened water sector governance,
financing arrangements, and policy coordination; (ii)enactment of integrated water resource management
(IWRM) towards sustainable water uses; (iii)improved service, asset management and usage productivity
in irrigation; and (iv) better access to water and sanitation services, and increased wastewater treatment
capacity. Following satisfaction of agreed actions in each of the four reform tracks, DPL-1 was disbursed
in June 2007. Despite good progress on the irrigation and water supply and sanitation reform tracks, DPL
2 could not be triggered as planned in 2008, due to delays in the implementation of sector governance
reforms and mixed results in the IWRM reform track. Accordingly the Programmatic DPL framework
expired in May 2009. Premature termination aside, the DPL process i s believed to have facilitated
meaningful policy and awareness gains, on the long path to sustainable management of water resources
and water demands. In support of the water pillar, programmatic ESW (P-ESW) was carried out as part of
a flexible, multi-year approach designed to support reform scoping and design, to promote interministerial
collaboration, and to benefit key institutional sector actors. Trust Fund support ($2.7 million) was
mobilized for studies and TA.

Adoption o f the National Sanitation Plan (PNA) for the period 2006-2009, and establishment o f criteria
for the allocation and management o f subsidies granted under this Plan; (ii)the development and launch

development o f rural water supply. Some critical institutional constraints were addressed, including
complexities and inefficiencies o f sector organization; breadth o f river basin agencies mandates exceeding
their financial resources; the slow enactment o f Law 10/95 on Water; the growing gap between water
demands and available water resources; and lack o f policies to manage demand. As highlighted in Table
A3.10, there was some good progress made in achieving the outcome indicators o f the CAS for this
component o f Pillar IV.

Increased Access to Water and Wastewater Treatment in Target Basins

54.
Concrete results were attained in increasing access to potable water and sanitation in rural
areas and poor peri-urban areas. The Bank supported through two interventions. In FY06, it approved
a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) project in the El Jadida and Safi provinces which supports
the national water operator - ONEP. The project development objective i s to support the government
program to increase sustainable access to potable water supply in rural areas, while promoting improved
wastewater management and hygiene practices. The project i s being implemented satisfactorily, although
with some procurement delays, and there i s a high demand from beneficiaries for the project’s services,
particularly for house connections. The project i s at i t s mid-term review point so i t i s s t i l l premature to
assess its impact. Preparation has recently started on a second ONEP Urban and Rural Water Systems
(URWS) project to meet urban and rural coverage and access goals in four provinces and pioneering a
household-connection service and sanitation strategy for rural areas.
55.
The second intervention, partially foreseen at the time o f the CAS, was to support an
innovative and successful large-scale pilot since 2007 in poor un-zoned periurban neighborhoods of
Casablanca, Meknes and Tangiers, to demonstrate Output Based Aid (OBA) mechanisms for the

101

Appendix 3
promotion of water and sanitation service connections in chronically un-served areas. Funded through a
$7 million GPOBA grant, this pilot program promotes innovative partnerships between private or public
operators, local authorities and the government, for the subsidized extension o f water service connections
in chronically neglected marginal areas. Progress and lessons learned to date on these pilots have been
very promising, and the principle of output-based aid as an efficient targeted subsidy mechanism has been
confirmed by the midterm review. The project i s aligned with INDH objectives and progress has been
such that, with due scale-up streamlining and adaptations, it can serve as a template for government to
achieve its stated INDH goals o f providing access to basic utility services in poor communities
nationwide.

56.
The Irrigation Based Community Development Project continued to be implemented
during the CAS period, reaching successfully local communities with small irrigation schemes and
strengthening bottom-up decision making mechanisms. This project was discussed above as regards
its achievements at rolling out a bottom-up participatory development approach but its impact on
irrigation and agricultural productivity merits discussion here. As noted in the ICR, the project’s
outcomes were considerable as it strengthened management of irrigation schemes in a participatory way
which lent to improved efficiency o f water use, greater agricultural productivity from better irrigation,
and ultimately improved incomes. The economic rate o f return on the irrigation investments surpassed
the project’s goal and the overall ICR rating was satisfactory (despite the problems with slow project
start-up and the lengthy implementation period).
57.
I F C has been very active in the water sector through several interventions: (i)a $40 million
equity investment and stand-by loan to Veolia Water International which was part o f a multi-region
investment; (ii)the Guerdane project, the first ever public-private partnership in irrigation, described
earlier; and (iii)the $2 1 million structured finance package to Radeej, a water/electricity/sewage utility in
El Jadida, also described earlier.

Water Sector Operator Performance

58.
The Ministry of Agriculture made progress in improving the performance o f irrigation
agencies. The irrigation tariff adjustment plan has been approved and i t s implementation has
begun. The collection rate for irrigation water bills i s now very good in most ORMVAs (Regional

102

Appendix 3
irrigation and agricultural extension agencies). Service delegation transactions (PPP) are under review
and ready to be rolled out for four ORMVAs. Public-public performance contracts have been developed,
with Bank assistance, between government and the ORMVAs. Gains are also reported in water supply
and sanitation service regulation (tariffs, performance), including a Service Delegation Law approved to
rule the selection and contracting o f service providers and their performance management. On the other
hand, limited progress was achieved for the design and implementation o f tariff policy reform and o f
regulation reform. I t i s too early to assess if Bank-supported initiatives to build capacity within water
resources management institutions or river basin agencies, will be conclusive. Despite the urgency, Bank
technical assistance for the development of sustainable aquifer management strategies and studies
conducted to forecast climate change impacts on agriculture and water resources management have until
now only benefited from partial government ownership, and have suffered data disclosure delays.

I n conclusion, the 2006-2009 CAS saw the Bank support important initiatives in Morocco’s
water sector. Results were seen in the irrigation and WSS subsectors, both determined in pursuing
reform, bridging infrastructure gaps and improving performance. Some progress has also been initiated
for WRM, but in this subsector however, government’s call for more effective policies and efficient
expenditure i s lagging, and depends upon a difficult switch to demand management policies and selective
pursuit o f new resource development. Nevertheless, the water sector partnership with the government
over the 2006-2009 period can be seen as productive. The Bank’s policy dialogue, investment lending,
policy lending and technical assistance have accompanied and supported several strategic and irreversible
transformations and gains.
V.

Other Cross-Cutting Elements o f the Bank Group’s Program in Morocco

Use of Country Systems

60.
The Bank has been in discussion with authorities in Morocco for several years to increase
the use of country systems in its program. The objective i s to help Morocco bring its national practices
in line with international good practices on financial management, procurement, as well as in the areas o f
environmental and social safeguards. The context i s that o f the commitments made in the Paris (2004)
and Accra (2008) Declarations on effectiveness o f development aid. Specifically, “donors agree to use
country systems as the first option for aid programs in support o f activities managed by the public sector”.
The government o f Morocco has encouraged the Bank to accelerate its efforts in this area.

103

Appendix 3

61.
The Moroccan government requested to be a pilot on the Use of Country Procurement
Systems. The assessment of the Moroccan procurement systems, as per the Pilot program’s
methodology, i s currently being finalized. It has concluded that Morocco has an overall solid public
procurement system. However, four areas of reform have been identified, which were discussed during a
National Symposium on Public Procurement organized by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in April
2009. According to the pilot program, a mid-term action plan i s to be agreed with the government in
order to confirm Morocco as a pilot country. The Bank expects to reach such an agreement before the end
of 2009. Morocco had also agreed to undergo external bench-marked evaluations of its financial
management systems (CPAR, CFAA in 2003 and 2007) and the PEFA in 2009. To date, the government
has demonstrated strong willingness to implement the action plans.
Important progress has been made towards adopting a country environmental and social
62.
protection system in World Bank-financed projects particularly regarding the strengthening of the
environment protection framework. During the preparation of the Solid Waste Sector Policy
Development Project, a fruitful dialogue started with the Moroccan authorities. An evaluation of the
environmental protection framework targeted to Waste Management was initiated and the differences
recorded have in great part been taken into consideration by the sector through convincing regulatory and
institutional measures, specifically through decentralization o f reviews and approvals of environmental
impact studies at the regional level, and also through preliminary public consultations.

Communications

64.
The program has main-streamed communications into Bank Group activities to support
reforms. This was facilitated by decision makers who were increasingly convinced of the need to open
up the dialogue on reforms to all socioeconomic actors. The Bank Group was recognized as a trusted
partner and a strong reform proponent. The communication activities aimed at promoting a better
understanding of issues, challenges and reform tradeoffs by all development partners to ensure increased
development effectiveness of Bank activities and programs.
65.
The communications strategy covering FY 2006-09 was based on the recommendations and
development challenges identified during the CAS preparation consultations. It was designed to
support Bank Group activities in order to achieve CAS strategic objectives. Through focusing on
promoting dialogue, building awareness and understanding of the reform process, communication
activities facilitated consensus-building for reform and contributed to public debate to generate more
proactive responses and leverage local ideas and inputs. It was implemented through four pillars - Media
Outreach, Civil Society Engagement, Knowledge Dissemination and Communication for Bank
Operations.
Box 1 -Client Feedback
Interviews o f selected government officials and development partners were conducted during the preparation o f this report.
Major points highlighted during these consultations include:
The World Bank Group i s sought after for its financing role, technical assistance, knowledge, and as an interlocutor,
convener and catalytic force o f other partners. It demonstrated great flexibility in implementing the CAS program,
showing very good responsiveness to Morocco’s needs and requests.
The World Bank Group has been instrumental, over the CAS period, in facilitating and accelerating the pace o f necessary
reforms in Morocco. Although the financial support i s appreciated, Bank Group i s considered as a key partner that brings
innovative solutions, catalyzes reforming ideas and helps bringing about change in Morocco. It i s also valued for its role
in voicing areas for improvement.
DPLs are very well appreciated as reform instruments. Although the overall quality o f ESW is viewed as high, some
remarks were made concerning the slow completion o f some o f the Bank products. There i s also some concern regarding
the supply-driven aspect o f some ESW that was undertaken during the CAS period.
There i s recognition o f the crucial role played by the Country Office in maintaining regular contacts with the government,
which allows for good coordination and ongoing evaluation o f the partnership strategy.
More formal consultations with government could be held regularly on the overall implementation o f the CAS program.
This would complement the CAS Progress Report that only allows for stocktaking o f the implementation o f the CAS
program at the midpoint period. There i s a perception that evaluation o f activities after completion is not sufficient,
especially in the case o f repeater projects, and does not allow assessing the ultimate impact o f projects in improving the
l i f e o f Moroccan citizens. Similarly, there i s some concern over the need for more and better monitoring and evaluation
by the government, in particular regarding the Bank Group’s program indicators.
There are high expectations on the use o f country systems, and it would be an important step forward in the relationship
with the Bank. On procurement in particular, issues faced in the INDH program have led the Bank to provide technical
support to their Moroccan counterparts, which has proven successful in improving Moroccan capacity and procedures.
This will be useful to the INDH but also more generally to other Bank projects in the country.
The Bank Group acts as a catalyst in many sectors. In education, donor coordination has been particularly successful, and
there are good prospects in the health sector for example. On the government side, discussions are underway in order to
improve the coordination framework for donor relationships.

Lessons Learned

Stratepic Enpavement

66.
Importance of Partnership. The implementation o f the CAS represented a shift in the nature o f
the relationship between the Bank Group and Morocco from one o f assistance to one o f partnership. This
shift was illustrated and greatly facilitated by broad-based country dialogue, which became more
pronounced during implementation. This led directly to adoption by the Bank o f a more flexible
approach on programming of activities and lending. Articulating this partnership more explicitly and
fully should be a priority o f the new CPS.
67.
Ensuring Both Continuity and Flexibility. Even with the flexible and client-responsive
approach that drove program adaptation, the four pillars structuring the CAS remained valid throughout
the program period. Engagement in on-going and new sectors were covered by the pillars. The Bank
Group’s flexibility was shown through adapting the scope o f the program (for example, engaging in new
sectors while doing less in others), as well as in timing and instrument choice (for example, with DPLs
assuming a greater than anticipated share o f lending becoming more important). The overall architecture
and on-going relevance o f the CAS four pillars were confirmed in the CAS Progress Report. They remain
a valid starting point in preparing the new CPS.
68.
Flexibility in Engagement. Flexibility and responsiveness were not new to the Bank Group’s
engagement in Morocco, but have now appropriately become the rule rather than the exception. From the
beginning o f CAS implementation, the Bank Group avoided a narrow interpretation o f its activities within
the somewhat detailed specifics of the initial CAS program. This was evident early in the CAS cycle
when opportunities quickly arose for fuller than anticipated in energy and solid waste sectors as well as in
the nation human development initiative. This flexible approach has allowed the Bank Group to make
greater contributions to Morocco’s development and has meant a better client-focused program, and
should continue to be a cornerstone o f the new CPS.
69.
Moving from Analysis to Advocacy to Action. The Government appreciated the Bank Group’s
partnership and flexibility and recognized i t s ability to provide support to areas with the potential for
path-changing, long-run impact. The Government had a good understanding of the Bank Group’s
comparative advantage and regularly confirmed where and how it wanted the Bank to play a role. The
nature o f engagement was one which moved from analysis, to advocacy and then action through a
sustained and incrementally larger package o f support (for example, as evident in the support to the
energy and solid waste sectors). This was a successful and appreciated approach and led to further
requests for increased financial support.
70.
Importance o f One World Bank Group. The implementation o f the CAS saw a very close
collaboration between IFC and IBRD. The broadened and expanded IFC program made important
contributions to several CAS pillars, aided by mutual knowledge and frequent communication. Joint
Bank-IFC involvement in the early stages o f analytical exercises or policy advice helped to secure impact.
The Bank has usually taken the lead in strategic analytical exercises (as with the investment climate
assessment) or policy advice, while the IFC-through i t s advisory services-has focused on more
operational assistance, supporting the implementation o f reforms. Bank staff involved in analytical work
have systematically been involved in the initial conceptual phase of IFC’s advisory services projects. In
the same way, IFC was consulted and involved in the preparation o f analytical pieces by the World Bank.
This collaboration provides a strong foundation for greater Bank Group synergies and should continue to
be a central element in the new CPS.

106

Appendix 3
Results

71.
Need for Greater Adaptation and Realism. The 2005 CAS result matrix was too specific. I t
contained detailed goals and multiple indicators that were over ambitious. The framework soon
provedobsolete, as experience quickly showed the need for program flexibility, with consequences for
changing planned outcomes and deliverables. Even in areas where the Bank did engage as planned, some
goals were seen as unrealistic and overly ambitious. In others, no baseline information was available,
making it difficult to assess progress. The CAS outcome indicators did not match the goals in the results
frameworks o f some o f the Bank Group’s projects (notably education) which were more realistic and
should have been used as the basis for assessing the Bank Group’s performance. The lesson learned i s to
ensure a more reasonable and practical results framework that accounts for the flexibility o f the Bank
Group’s approach. In this respect, the new CPS results framework should be simplified but dynamic,
with the intention that it should evolve as the program evolves.
72.
Joint and Dynamic Accountability. There i s a need to work more closely with the Government
to jointly assess progress and update results and indicators. Monitoring and evaluation of development
activities are currently insufficient and there i s a need for a stronger results orientation for both
Government and Bank Group programs. In the context o f a Middle Income Country strategy, the Results

’

Framework should allow sufficient flexibility to adapt to the evolving program. At the same time, it
should be used as a management tool for both the Bank Group and Government to build management and
monitoring capacity in Government institutions, including those supported by Bank Group programs.
This should be pursued through building the capacity o f Government agencies to plan, budget and
manage for results. The Bank’s project teams will also need to focus more on helping sectors develop
M&E systems which would in turn help project data collection and reporting. As the new CPS i s
implemented, the Bank Group and Government should jointly assess progress and update results and
indicators to reflect the increased specificity o f the program and to ensure continuedjoint accountability.

Attribution versus Contribution. The results approach in the CAS reflected an overly
73.
ambitious attempt to show direct attribution of Bank activities to country outcomes. As a provider of a
significant yet modest proportion o f international development finance to Morocco, the Bank Group’s
impact on core development indicators i s limited, making it difficult to measure impact. In some areas
such as public administration and education, the Bank i s just one o f many development actors and
finances a relatively small amount o f the overall education program, so it i s inappropriate to apply a
standard o f attribution o f outcomes to the Bank’s program. This needs to be taken into account going
forward.
Propram Activities

74.
Experience with DPLs. The DPL lending instrument became more important in the Bank’s
program during CAS implementation based mainly on the Government’s expressed preference for this
type o f support. The tranche or programmatic support o f DPLs created a dynamic o f institutional and
financial incentives which were conducive to the achievement o f the intended results. In some instances,
the Government used its commitment to the DPLs as a tool to concretize reforms and overcome the
administrative inertia and disagreements between responsible department^'^. In DPLs, the quality o f the
underlying technical analysis i s essential to a successful outcome2’. The success o f the DPLs was due in
large part because there was a strong underlying foundation o f technical analysis that underpinned the
policy dialogue and reform program. In particular, the Programmatic ESW (P-ESW) was used very
effectively in support o f the PARL, energy and water sector DPLs.
19

2o

This was a concrete lesson learned as outlined in the ICR for the Housing Sector DPL but also i s relevant to other sectors.
The ICRs o f the PARL and Financial Sector DPL provide details on this point.

107

Appendix 3
However, experience from implementing the different DPLs was mixed. In the case o f the
75.
PARL and the Financial Sector DPL, the Ministry o f Finance was simultaneously the champion of
reforms, the ministry responsible for their implementation and the direct beneficiary o f the DPL funds to
the national budget. This created a more conducive environment for effective implementation and hence
success. This was not the case, however, with the Energy, Water or Housing DPLs which involved
multiple ministries and agencies, thus complicating the reform environment. For a reform approach that
involves several actors, it i s essential to have the right level o f coordination and to have a shared
understanding o f the institutional incentives. Going forward, more attention needs to be placed on how to
strengthen that coordination.

76.
The success of a reform program i s due not only to legal measures taken but also to
strengthening o f the capacity o f the institutions involved in the reform. The importance o f
institutional coordination around reforms and their implementation i s also critical. Commitment and
goodwill alone are not sufficient and it i s essential to ensure the institutional capacity of implicated
agencies to implement their component o f the reform. In a MIC such as Morocco with a clear sense o f
the challenges ahead and strategies in place, the Bank Group’s program should focus less on the “what”
and more on the “how to”. This i s crucial to respond to the main challenges o f the reform process implementation and results.

77.
Donor coordination played an important role in project success and this needs to be further
reinforced going forward. In the case o f the PARL, Education and the Rural Roads projects, donors
provide support on the same program framework that benefited the client by building credibility for the
reforms but also focusing on a unified expertise from donors in support to a complex program o f reform
(particularly the case for the PARL). For the Bank and other donors, this has helped to mitigate the
reputational risk of some types o f reforms and has reduced the supervisory burden on each donor. Given
that there are now clear strategies in place for each sector, the onus i s on the donors to really follow
through on their commitment for greater harmonization through aligning themselves better around these
strategies and ensuring joint implementation o f reform programs and investments. Such efforts at
harmonization should be central to all areas o f Bank Group engagement for the future.
78.
The Challenge o f Service Delivery. The experience gleaned from Pillars I1 and 111 o f the CAS
highlights the long-term challenge o f strengthening service delivery to ensure shared prosperity and
greater equity. Results in the education sector were perhaps the most muted o f all the Bank’s
interventions and some of Morocco’s indicators in the social sectors give rise to concern despite the
attention and resources provided to address them. A strict focus on access to basic services comes often
at the expense o f enhancing the quality o f these services for all. There i s o f course no quick fix here but
rather this demands a second generation o f reforms that reorient service delivery on the users rather than
providers. Such a shift should underline future Bank Group interventions in this area.

79.
Importance o f a Longer-Term Framework for Certain Activities. Experience from
implementing the two rural projects (DRI PMH and DRI MVB) and from implementingthe INDH to date
have shown that bottom-up participatory approaches take time to get off the ground and demand a huge
amount o f careful preparation and capacity building up-front before investments can be rolled out.
Indeed, often the very creation o f a participatory approach and the necessary management and
coordination committees are achievements in themselves and can absorb the focus o f the first phase of
project implementation. This obliges a longer-tern focus o f support that continues the partnership
through this first preparatory phase and into future phases o f implementation and investment.

80.
Communications. The CAS launched a broad series o f consultations during i t s preparation and
this was further advanced during implementation. These consultations nourished priority setting and
knowledge exchanges and were mainstreamed into the communications strategy of the Bank Group which
108

Appendix 3

itself was designed to support the achievement o f the CAS strategic objectives. Through focusing on
promoting dialogue, building awareness and understanding o f the reform process, the Bank Group
facilitated consensus-building for reform and contributed to feeding the public debate in view o f
generating more proactive responses and leveraging local ideas and inputs. This has been a truly pathbreaking endeavor in Morocco and should be consolidated during the implementation o f the next CPS.

81.
Use of Country Systems. Morocco has high expectations for i t s eligibility on the use o f country
systems. It has considerably strengthened its public financial management, procurement and safeguards
procedures. Donors have increasingly assessed Morocco to be a good reformer in this regard, with more
than 80 percent o f donor financing now delivered through country systems, according to the estimate
made in 2007 in the context of the Accra process. It i s therefore important to continue and extend the
positive collaboration to date. This i s a challenge that must be reflected in the next CPS.

Appendix 4: CONSULTATION REPORT
Overview
1. . I n development, consulting i s essential at every step of the process. In Morocco, the World
Bank has been engaged for a long time in the regular process o f consultations with the government as
well as with numerous actors and stakeholders involved in the development o f the country. Consultations,
conducted in a variety o f formats, took place at strategic planning meetings, during preparation and
supervision phases o f projects, throughout the preparation and dissemination o f analytical work as well as
in the monitoring and evaluation phase of projects.
2.
The aim of this dialogue was to better understand the priorities, challenges and obstacles. It
also contributed to defining the perceptions, the consensus, as well as the divisions o f opinion and was an
opportunity to disseminate analytical reports and lessons learned. These consultations also shaped the
thought process and the approaches as well as the implementation o f programs in the different sectors.
Consultations for preparing the strategic partnership framework took place over an 18 month period and
included the following steps:
Technical meetings. They were primarily focused on sectors, contributed to shaping the
programmatic choices and guided the dialogue throughout the 18 month period.
Internal consultations at the World Bank. The meetings

at Kairouan (November 2008) and Annapolis (March
2009) facilitated a joint reflection and cross sectoral
coordination of the Bank teams and the IFC to attempt
to respond in a more concerted way to the needs o f the
country.

A strategic meeting between Moroccan government
representatives and a team from the World Bank
(Skhirat, April 2009) provided clarification and
recorded the expectations of the government in the
framework o f the partnership. Finally, a phase o f broad
consultations, directly focusing on preparing the CPS,
took place during the months o f May and June 2009.
This report summarizes this most recent phase o f
consultations.(See highlightst o the right).

this broad consultation:

The participation of more than 30 experts
from the World Bank Group, local and
international at different meetings.

To discuss the priorities and the role o f the World
Bank in Morocco: The consultations were structured so as to introduce the World Bank Group’s
approach to development in order to gather opinions on the development priorities in the country;
the themes proposed by the CPS (pillars and cross sectoral themes); the role o f the World Bank in
Morocco, perceptions relating to the efficiency of i t s activities and its impacts; and the aspects to
strengthen to better support the country.

audiences and the beneficiaries who have the least input in order to listen to their particular
visions and their perspectives on development priorities in ,Morocco. Particular attention was
given to youth, women’s NGOs, local NGOs (particularly in rural areas), young researchers and
students.
T o provide depth to the consultations on the sector specific themes. Thematic consultations
were conducted on the subjects and/or the sectors that emerged from the discussions during the
pre CPS consultations phase and that had to be approached through other tools for example:
gender issues, the knowledge economy, public-private partnership, or the stakes in development
in rural areas.

4.

The second part of the consultation phase organized in May and June 2009 was comprised
of 18 meetings. These meetings were organized according to a variety o f formats (roundtables, broadbased meetings, workshops, and brainstorming. Participation was at both local and national levels.

Participants were from different provinces, primarily Rabat, Fes, Casablanca, Tanger, and Marrakech and
came from rural, semi-urban and urban areas.

5.
These meetings were characterized by an atmosphere that encouraged free and open
dialogue and they were a rich and unique experience for the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region. Although the debates were at times passionate when discussing the means and activities
to implement to concretize the development objectives, there was a broad consensus on the strategic
direction that emerged from the first phase o f consultations. The criticisms and the suggestions were
constructive and focused on the future with a common interest to work for the successful transition o f the
country towards stronger human development and a place in the global economy. Additionally, the
debates facilitated a progressive and conceptual understanding of the CPS with the different audiences

Principal Consultations: Debates and Recommendations

Investment and development in the private sector

I.A.4 Consultations with representativesfrom the private sector:
6.
This meeting, jointly organized with the I F C brought together actors from the private
sector, several of whom worked quite far from the Rabat-Casablanca area. The open and
constructive debate assisted in forging a new consensus around two priorities considered by the
participants as being essential elements:

0

Importance o f maintaining economic growth as a necessary condition of development.
Necessity of developing a clearly articulated strategic vision of the Moroccan economy with
several projects o f reform.

122

Appendix 4
The efforts and the engagement of the government to improve the business environment was
acknowledged and emphasized in different discussions; however, several participants brought up the
persistence of certain obstacles to investment particularly concerning the financial sector and public
administration, specifically:

0

Difficulty of access to bank credit and particularly the slow nature of the process;
Lack of visibility on the State’s fiscal policy for the next 5 years;
Weakness in the correspondence of education to the employment market and the lack o f qualified
staff;
Slow nature of the decentralization process and the lack of transparency within the public
administration.

7.
Several recommendations were formulated and
particularly emphasized the importance o f reforms in the
judicial and education sectors. Several participants stated that

these reforms are essential conditions that cannot be ignored in
the development of the private sector. Several other suggestions
covering cross sectoral themes included:

0

Strengthening human capital through educational reforms
and professional training;
Accelerating the implementation of industrial policies already developed such as “Emergence” in
implementing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms;
Initiating a regular and sustainable dialogue with the different decision makers, the financial
sector and the economic operators;
Broaden the dialogue with employers in a manner that includes a l l regions of the country beyond
the Rabat Casablanca area;
Adapt the tax system to the specifics of the Moroccan economic fabric while taking into
consideration the world economic environment and i t s constraints.

The informal sector was also intensely discussed and brought out diverging points of view. For certain
participants, the issue i s of better controlling the informal sector that i s currently not subject to any tax
system. Others see the problem as an excess of taxes and controls that push businesses to the informal
sector.

II.A.4 Consultations on Public Private Partnership (PPP)
8.
This consultation brought together representatives from public establishments and private
enterprises who manage delegated services to discuss opportunities for and constraints to
developing public private partnerships in Morocco. Two principal elements were identified as areas
T
requiring considerable restructuring:
\

0

The legal environment to facilitate public private
partnerships in Morocco.
The problem of underinvestmentand lack of inclusion in
budgeting o f services.

Several activities and reforms designed to promote public private
partnerships were formulated:

123

“The legislative environment

Strengthen transparency in the grants process of public private partnership contracts;
Define and clarify the institutional plan of delegated management and establish the necessary

Analyze the budgeting systems for delegated public services, the proposed budgetary allocations
and the priorities determined by the government;
Revisit programming and strengthen the levels o f investments which remain insufficient;
Develop capacities of central and local civil servants for more efficient management o f public
private partnerships.
Most o f the participants also called for more consideration o f the social implications o f public private
partnerships. According to certain participants, an overhaul o f the labor law and management laws
delegated to the public authorities has become a necessity.

Consultation on the Knowledge Economy:
9.
This consultation brought private operators, academics and representatives o f the public
administration back together and began by discussing the significant progress that Morocco has
made in the domain of information technology and communication both in terms o f infrastructure
and regulation. The debates that followed the presentation o f the Impact Plan, which aims to implement
the necessary conditions to make the Knowledge Economy a motor o f economic development in
Morocco, identified the challenges that need to be met for the promotion o f a knowledge economy.
The participants unanimously agreed that while Morocco has strong potential for developing digital
content and strengthening human competencies, there are many obstacles that need to be addressed:

Seriously promote research and innovation that could help this sector create value and wealth;
Encourage private operators to do more to promote their activities, which would make this sector
to more attractive to young people.
Services to Citizens:

10.
The following three cross sectoral elements emerged from the discussions during the first
phase of consultations and the open debates in the meetings of the second phase of consultations as
key elements to improve the impact and consistency of the reforms.

124

Appendix 4
Involve all concerned parties in the development o f reform projects. Support from civil society
should be better channeled to increase the efficiency o f the reforms;
Economic policies to strengthen growth should take into consideration the most vulnerable
populations;

The different programs in the fight against poverty should be better coordinated for a
more comprehensive approach and execution.

Throughout the meetings, the different audiences who were consulted invited the Bank to provide a more
detailed analysis of the Moroccan economy in order to move towards quantitative indicators and an
examination of major structural impediments.

Consultations on the Education Sector
11.
I n all consultations, the education sector emerged as being at the heart of development
challenges in Morocco. In addition, the discussion with the civil society actors, the private sector,
academics, and public partnerships raised the following concerns:
The quality o f education i s very low and i s still more problematic in the context o f current
economic changes in Morocco.
Reforming the education system should be considered the highest priority in terms o f reforms and
particular attention should be focused on the quality of teaching and informal education.

12.
The debate on public education vs. private education
was characterized by several diverging views. Although several participants recommended regulation
of the private education sector, it was also suggested that both private and informal education alternatives
be encouraged, especially in rural areas. A third suggestion was made to strengthen partnerships between
the actors in the private and public sectors. As for higher education, the participants expressed their
satisfaction with the launching o f the Urgent Plan for the Acceleration o f the Implementation of
Education Reform and Training 2009-20 1 1. However, they insisted that i s necessary to emphasize the
value o f scientific research in Morocco and the importance o f including the university in the development
o f socio economic research. Several participants brought up the problem o f the territorial approach of
development and the importance o f considering the university community as an essential partner to
resolve specific problems o f development to each region.

Appendix 4

Consultations on reforming the judicial system
13.
Reform of the judicial system was brought up in the majority o f consultations as being a
development priority in Morocco. The different actors who were consulted shared similar points o f
view and there was an overwhelming consensus that reform o f the judicial system was an essential
condition for success and consistent reforms in the other socio economic sectors. The consultation session
on the judicial sector also invited back representatives from a network o f 10 Moroccan associations that
had introduced a memorandum calling for reform in the judicial sector in Morocco. Throughout the
discussion o f suggestions contained in the memorandum and the debate that followed, important elements
emerged as priorities in formulating a strategy for reform that would be both voluntary and ambitious:
Reform should be comprehensive in developing a strategy that strengthens the development of a
modern equitable judicial system;

Gender and Development
14.
Two consultations were organized around the crosscutting theme of gender. The first meeting
gathered representatives from development associations, economists and sociologists specializing in

these two meetings confirm that the advances in terms o f reforms for a better integration o f gender
aspects are undeniable, notably in the sectoral plan. However, the lack o f consistency and coordination o f
sectoral actions denotes the absence o f a national strategy incorporating gender. The following
recommendations were formulated as being necessary conditions to ensure an equitable and sustainable
development in all the,sectors:

Education reform and strengthening women’s access to
the judicial system (particularly thorough training) are
crucial to the empowerment o f women.
In dept, analyses and cross sectoral studies on gender
should be conducted to serve as the foundation o f a
comprehensive national strategy that could then be used
at the sectoral level.
Analysis of the impact of the global economic crisis on
employment and women’s role in the labor force should
be conducted immediately because the sectors that are
threatened are essentially those that will impact women in
terms o f business and employment.

Governance, Development and Basic Services

15.

The governance aspect in the sense of access to basic services by citizens was raised as an
issue. A wide consensus was reached in the consultations on the following axes:

0

0

Balance between economic and social issues needs to be maintained through better distribution of
the outputs of growth;
The success o f reforms i s measured according to the impact on the daily lives o f citizens.
Monitoring and evaluation o f results o f the reforms i s absolutely necessary;
Monitoring and evaluation o f results o f the reforms will bring improvement in poverty reduction
programs and should therefore serve as a reference to measure the results that show
accountability for funds.

This approach has a direct impact on the improvement o f governance.

Consultations on Governance and Citizen Services
16.
Morocco has a large variety o f associations that have an important role to play in the
development of the country in a dynamic and constructive approach. The consultations with the
consumer associations, who are an important component o f the Moroccan association community,
allowed for the gathering o f opinions on the obstacles that inhibit
performance in certain key sectors such as education, health and
the judicial system. The absence o f evaluation mechanisms and
ensuring accountability in public administration were recurring
points that emerged from the consultations. The importance o f
strengthening the mechanisms o f evaluation and transparency in
terms o f delegation o f management o f public services was strongly underlined.
The majority o f participants identified the problems o f governance at three levels:
0
0

0

The lack o f mechanisms and transparent procedures encourage abuse;

Inadequate access to information leads to a lack o f understanding o f rights and civic
duties;
The absence o f effective monitoring and evaluation takes responsibility away from the
managers.

These three elements demonstrate a close link between the
efficiency o f public and private services and good governance.

“Good governance is based on
sharing information. Unfortunately,
this is not happening. ”

Consultation on governance and local development
17.
This roundtable, comprised of representatives
of the association community from the north, focused on the following themes: The important
socioeconomic transformations put the governance at the core of the problem in local development. The
participants raised the point that the lack o f good governance i s an obstacle to local development and
produces a loss o f confidence o f the population in the public management. They a l l identified the need to:

127

The importance o f the “support” role that the World Bank Group can play in

strengthen the analytical field, the evaluation and debates on reform programs and in
collaboration with the different stakeholders in the development of the country (government,

civil society, and private sector).

The support o f the Bank should be cross sectoral and improve the consistency o f development
programs, particularly, in terms o f good governance in the key sectors- education, justice and the
financial sector.

Poverty and statistical information
24.
This question was widely emphasized by numerous participants during different
consultations. According to the participants:

0

More detailed impact analyses are necessary for the government to formulate policies that
respond to the challenges in the priority sectors, particularlyjustice, education and governance.
Support the efforts of the High Commission Plan to develop the statistics by gender in the areas
such as poverty, the standard of living, work of rural women and other areas for which there i s
relatively little statistical information.
Raw statistical disaggregated data should be accessible to actors in development, particularly to
researchers.

Implementation of reforms
This key theme continued to recur and was the subject of several discussion threads in the different
25.
meetings. The participants expressed the following points of view:

If the reports are objective and the strategies are defined, the actual challenge for the country i s
the effective and efficient implementationof reforms.
0
A cross sectoral consistency of reforms i s essential given the interdependence of sectors
Certain participants also expressed their wish that the World Bank Group improve their performance
indicators to facilitate the monitoring of reforms in which they participate.
0

Social protection and fight against exclusion
26.
This subject was raised in a recurrent and crosscutting manner throughout the
consultations. I t came up in most of the interventions in the framework of the following observations:
An analysis of results and real impact of programs in the fight against poverty i s necessary;
It i s necessary to introduce implementation of a real policy of social protection particularly in
extending the coverage of social security and in strengthening the mechanisms of the fight
against social exclusion (youth and women);
It i s important to consider the vulnerable segments of the population who can be affected by
reforms;
Specific studies should be conducted to better identify the needs of certain vulnerable categories
of society;
The changes which are directly discernable for the users should be placed at the heart of programs
of development in Morocco.

Appendix 5

Appendix 5: USE OF COUNTRY SYSTEMS
1.
This note summarizes the Bank’s overall view of country systems in Morocco today, the process
underway to improve such systems, and the direction for furthering the Bank/MOG partnership on use of
country systems during the CPS 20 10 to 20 13 .2’
I.

Country systems in Morocco today

2.
Financial management. The five main components of country systems are budgeting,
accounting and financial reporting, treasury management, internal controls and internal audit, and external
audit. The Bank’s experience in Morocco, the CFAAs (2003 and an update in 2007), and the PEFA
review (2009) indicate that the public financial management system i s governed by an elaborate legal and
regulatory framework including a strict control framework that has ensured a high degree of reliability of
the accounts and transparency. The public financial management cadre i s of good quality. In general, the
Moroccan public finance system i s considered to pose a low fiduciary risk. Bank-funded projects are
fully integrated in the government annual budget. Bank financed projects are also integrated in the
government accounting system. The Bank has long relied on the government treasury system for
effecting project expenditures. Bank funded projects are subject to the existing national internal control
system for control of commitments and payments. Annual audits of Bank-financed projects on the other
hand are carried out by the Inspection Ge‘ne‘rale des Finances (IGF) and reporting on donor funded
activities i s based on parallel systems.
3.
Procurement. The Moroccan public procurement system i s considered one of those in the M N A
Region most in line with international best practice, the results of a major reform process underway since
1998. The system comprises the framework of laws and regulations; procurement procedures, capacity
and staffing; how these procedures are applied in practice; and measures to ensure integrity. The
governing laws and regulations largely follow international practice, a view generally endorsed by the
administration, the private sector and civil society. Public finance, including procurement, generally
benefits from a strong and effective audit culture. Bank reviews, notably the CPAR (2008), PEFA review
(2009), and a further internal procurement review” all generally note that overall fiduciary risk i s low.
Bank evaluation of national systems has allowed use of relatively high thresholds for national competitive
bidding in the Bank’s portfolio of investment operations. At the same time, the laws and regulations of
the government do not apply to public enterprises (many of whom, however, have alternative strong
systems and human resources), architectural services, and concessions. There i s not yet an effective
complaints mechanism in place.

4.
The quality of the Moroccan procurement system has evolved very positively during the last
10 years. The revision of the public procurement decree led to improvements, such as an increase in the
minimum bid preparation period for high value contracts, the implementation of electronic publication of
procurement and award notices encompassing the largest part of public procurement packages, and the
reinforcement of measures aimed at the prevention of fraud and corruption. Standard bidding documents
for goods and works were put in place in 2009. Further reform of the public procurement control
mechanisms i s ongoing. International arbitration in contracts and bidding documents has been
introduced. A Central Body for Prevention of Fraud and Corruption has been created. In addition to the
above, other reform activities under preparation include: preparation of General Conditions of Contract
for Goods and Services, amendment of the General Conditions of Contract for Works, and preparation o f
For the purpose o f this annex, country systems are those pertaining to financial management, procurement, and social and
environmental safeguards.

regulations related to the Public private partnership law.

5.
Social and environmental safeguards. Important progress has been made in this area, especially
during 2008, particularly regarding the strengthening of the environment protection framework.
Preparation of the Solid Waste Sector Policy Development Project in 2007 saw the start of a dialogue
with the authorities in this area. An evaluation of the environmental protection framework targeted to
waste management was initiated and the differences recorded have largely been taken into consideration
by the sector through significant regulatory and institutional measures, specifically through
decentralization of reviews and approvals of environmental impact studies at the regional level, and also
through the introduction of a public consultation process during the environmental assessment process.
The process now being followed to fill major gaps between the Moroccan system and internally accepted
principles and practices i s described in paragraph 9 below.
11.

Process to improve country systems

6.
Financial management. U s e of country systems in financial management (and other areas)
contributes to scaled-up development impact, increased country ownership, better capacity, donor
harmonization, and increased cost-effectiveness, For these reasons they are, where feasible, the default
option for implementing Bank-supported projects. The Bank has identified areas where improvements
can be made, on which it i s in dialogue with national authorities. These include reduced delays in
drafting annual financial statements, greater use of the recently-completed integrated system (GID) to
track and report on all expenditures, a stronger internal audit function in line Ministries in order to
provide an assurance on the soundness of, and compliance with internal controls in the light of the
ongoing reforms, and the move from the ex-ante to ex-post controls and greater accountability of public
sector managers. Greater reliance on country systems and institutions requires a shift of the independent
audit function of donor-funded activities to the National Audit institution, the Cour des comptes, an
institution that has seen major reforms and improvements and alignment with international standards over
the past few years.
7.
Procurement. The Bank and the government have been in dialogue on procurement reform for
many years. Dialogue includes other leading donors, and i s considered by the Bank to be intense and
productive. Morocco confirmed its interest in becoming a candidate for the pilot use of country
procurement systems approved by the Bank board in April 2008, the first country in the M N A Region to
do so. In a recent report on the use of country procurement systems, Morocco received relatively high
evaluation scores, clearing 43 criteria out of the 55 defined by the OECD/DAC methodology, one o f the
highest scores recorded.23At the same time, some of the criteria on which it did not attract an adequate
score will require action before country systems can be used. Morocco i s a leader in providing electronic
access to public procurement information and processes (see www.marchespublics.lzov.ma), and has
launched initiatives to promote e-procurement.

8.

23

The key improvement for meeting the UCS piloting program has been identified as follows:
Legalfiamework (ensure broad legal consistency of public procurement policies and principles of
all public procuring entities and covering all types of goods, works and services through a public
procurement law covering all public entities and all types o f goods, works and services; ensure
that “objective qualification and evaluation criteria” specified in the public procurement decree
are reflected in the standard bidding documents; and develop/amend the general conditions of
contract for further alignment with international best practices and recent evolution within the
Moroccan public procurement framework).
See Piloting Program in Use of Country Systems - First Progress Report, SecM2009-05 13, October 5,2009, Annex D UCS Evaluation Scores.

133

Appendix 5
Integrity in public procurement system (restructure the complaints mechanism towards a system
that i s independent, efficient, transparent, having the authority to suspend the ongoing
procurement and to make binding decisions; put in place an effective internal control mechanism;
and provide additional staff and resources to the entity responsible for fighting fraud and
corruption to allow it to carry out its mandate effectively).
The Bank hopes to reach agreement with the government shortly on an action plan (as foreseen in the
approved pilot program) to address these issues.

9.
Social and environmental safeguards. The Bank i s expanding the process described in
paragraph 5 to include the water and sanitation sector through a project currently under preparation (Oum
Er Rbia Sanitation Project). With regards to social safeguards, more specifically projects involving
involuntary resettlement o f people, land acquisition, or expropriation for public use, the Bank intends to
identify and seek to resolve known differences through a process similar to that applied to environmental
safeguards. This will involve analysis o f the equivalence between Morocco’s regulatory and institutional
framework and the principles that constitute the basis of World Bank policies. This will be followed by
an evaluation o f the acceptability o f the implementation modalities of this framework. The Bank has
initiated this approach in the preparation phase of the Oum Er Rbia Sanitation Project. This approach will
allow a deeper dialogue between Moroccan authorities and the Bank towards harmonizing the systems
applicable to these aspects and also towards gradually using Moroccan environmental and social
safeguards systems in Bank-financed projects.

111.

Advancing Use of Country Systems in the CPS

10.
Government o f Morocco has consistently been requesting the Bank and other donors to
make increased use o f country systems, in line with their commitments to do so in the Paris
Declaration (2005) and Accra Agenda for Action (2008).24 I t wishes to see tangible progress made in
Morocco toward this objective during CPS implementation. According to the 2008 Survey on the
implementation o f the Paris declaration, the proportion o f donors financing disbursed through what can
broadly be described as national systems has been increasing, budget support contributing largely to these
results. Building on the processes described above, the Bank will sustain its partnership with the
government to assess systems, identify directions for improvements, invest in capacity building and
accompany change implementation, with the objective o f progressively increasing the use o f country
systems.

24

Paragraph 15 o f the Accra Agenda for Action states that “Donors agree to use country systems as the first option for aid
programs in support o f activities managed by the public sector [...I
Should donors choose to use another option and rely on
aid delivery mechanisms outside country systems (including parallel project implementation units), they will transparently
state the rationale for this and will review their positions at regular intervals.”

134

Appendix 6
Appendix 6: DONORS’ DEPLOYMENT

I.

Overview

1.
Morocco has good relations with its development partners, aided by a national vision for the
country’s development and by its development achievements, particularly over the past ten years.
There i s broad support among Morocco’s donors for its chosen strategic direction.
2.
Most donor programs have aimed to align with the government program that was approved
by Parliament in October 2007. The individual sectoral strategies and medium-term expenditure
frameworks that have been laid out since then present a good framework for donors to deliver their
support more effectively.

3.
Donor programs in Morocco - especially those of the large donors - have seen increasing
volumes of financing over the past few years. The increased financial support reflects recognition o f
Morocco’s leadership o f the national development effort, support for the approved national program, and
a demonstrated track record o f achievement. Around eighty percent o f donor financing in the last three
years was disbursed using what can be broadly described as national systems either through budgetary
support or other instruments. Budgetary support i s widely used by Morocco’s larger donors-the
European Union (where it exceeds 90 percent), the African Development Bank, and the World Bankand i s becoming an increasingly important instrument for bilateral donors.
4.
Overall, donor coordination has improved in recent years, and i s relatively good. Donors
are willing to cooperate closely around the government program. The responsibility to oversee donor’s
programs i s shared across three different ministries in Morocco (Ministry of Finance, Ministry o f Foreign
Affairs and Ministry o f Economic and General Affairs). The government has indicated that it wishes to
see more progress made more quickly on implementing the principles and commitments of the
international aid effectiveness agenda, adapted as appropriate to Moroccan circumstances. There i s scope
for improvement by donors in this area. Donors are making progress to ensure harmonized upstream
country and sector programming. Greater harmonization was facilitated in 2009 when four o f Morocco’s
main donors - World Bank, AfDB, AFD and EU - all either prepared a new strategy (World Bank and
AFD) or updated their strategies at the mid-way point (EU and AfDB), with broad national and crossdonor consultation and collaboration a feature o f the process o f each.
5.
Donor collaboration has been strongest in those areas in which donors have been engaged
over the long-term, such as public administration, education, and .transport, and in more recent
priority areas such as the National Initiative for Human Development (Table A8.1). Furthermore,
there i s good recognition o f the relative competences and areas o f comparative advantage o f each donor:
for example, the EU i s taking the lead among donors on gender and human rights issues, while EIB i s
heavily involved in infrastructure investments.

6.
Donor aid accounts for a small proportion o f government financing - between 4 and 5% in
2007 albeit higher than in many other middle income c~untries.’~More than 95 percent o f all
reported sources in 2007 came from the seven largest donors (France, EC, Germany, Japan, Spain, Italy,
and the US). Aid volumes have been increasing over time, more than doubling from 2004 to 2007. In
addition to official development assistance (ODA), IBRD commitments and gross disbursements have
averaged $280 million and $284.5 million respectively in the last four fiscal years. Annual lending from
the AfDB has been in a similar range.

-

*’ODA to Morocco in 2007 was $1.3 billion (source: OECD DAC database). This excludes financing provided by IBRD (to
~

whom debt repayments largely equal disbursements in recent years) and AfDB.

Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness

7.
I n recent years, around 80 percent o f donor financing was disbursed using national budget,
financial reporting and auditing, and procurement procedures either through budget support
operations or projects making use of country systems. The large majority o f donor financing i s
directed to the government sector (World Bank - 96%, AfDB - 93% and EU - 90%). A significant
portion o f the programs o f some bilaterals, such as Spain, Germany and Canada, i s delivered to the nongovernment sector.

8.
A survey in 2008 into implementation of the Paris Declaration in Morocco revealed a
broadly positive message. At the same time, it recognized that donors could do more to align better with
government program and concluded with a shared understanding o f the need to make progress on more
streamlined and harmonized results management. Discussions with the government reveal impatience to
see implementation deepened and accelerated.

The Main Donors in Morocco

9.
The European Union program is set in the context o f the EU Neighborhood Policy.26 Since
2000, Morocco and the EU have increased significantly their cooperation and integration through the
signing of many bilateral agreements. Most important was the signature of the Association Agreement
which entered into force in 2000. In 2008, the European Union and Morocco further strengthened
relations when Morocco was accorded “Advanced Association” status (see Box A6.1 below).

10.
Morocco receives financial support from the European Neighborhood and Partnership
grant instrument. The EU grants an increasing proportion of that assistance in the form of budgetary
support for the implementation of Morocco’s major structural reforms (90 percent of EU aid i s now
delivered through budget support). The current financial programming covers the period 2007-2010 and
involves a total commitment for the EU-Morocco partnership program of 698 million Euros, equivalent to
$1,033 million. Specifically for 2009, financing will be in the order of 3 17 million Euros ($469 million),
compared to 228 million Euros ($337 million) delivered in 2008.

I

Box A6.1: Morocco’s EU Advanced Association Status Main Measures
Morocco i s the first and only southern Mediterranean country to obtain Advanced Association Status with the EU, which was
granted in 2008. The advanced status means an increase i n EU aid, participation in several European agencies, and a generally
more favorable position within the overall E U neighborhood policy. I t constitutes an ambitious roadmap for the years to come, in
particular:
I n the political field: establishment, on an ad hoc basis, o f an EU-Morocco summit, ministerial-level consultation
mechanisms, an invitation to Morocco to be present in the wings o f certain E U Council ministerial or working group
meetings, negotiation o f a framework agreement for Morocco’s participation in crisis-management operations; and
strengthening dialogue channels between both parties’ legislative institutions, in order to bring Morocco’s legislation
closer to that o f the EU.

Economically, both partners will seek to develop a comprehensive and deeper free trade agreement covering new
areas such as public procurement, intellectual property rights, capital movements, competition and sustainable
development.
Other policy matters to be pursued include: harmonization o f laws and rules in a gradual process beginning with
priority sectors; the gradual integration o f Morocco into a number o f EU sectoral policies; and the development o f
people-to-people exchanges.
International security: Morocco’s participation, systematically, in the EU’s peace keeping operation, without having to
negotiate the terms o f each operation.

1 1.
The European Union i s finalizing i t s Indicative National Program (Programme Zndicatif
National - P I N which covers the 2011-2013 period and i s based on the folIowing priority axes: (i)
development o f social policy; (ii) economic modernization; (iii) institutional support; (iv) good
governance and human rights; and (v) protection of environment. It i s expected that financing for this
program will be greater than in the past. Initial indications are that the program will exceed 165 million
Euros per year.
The EuroDean Investment Bank (EIB) has been active in Morocco since 1978. Morocco,
12.
Egypt and Tunisia are the three largest users o f EIB funding in the region, with Morocco claiming
a share o f about 20% o f dedicated regional resources. The main focus of EIB’s investments in
Morocco i s infrastructure, particularly energy, transport and water sectors and this focus i s expected
should continue in the next three years. Development of the private sector, particularly small and
medium-sized enterprises, and creating a favorable investment climate are also priorities of the EIB’s
26

World Bank relations with the European Commission and the European Investment Bank in the MENA region are structured
around the Strategic Partnership Agreement in the Middle East and North Africa Region M o U (signed in May 2004 and
joined by IFC in 2007) and the Luxemburg Group process. The Luxembourg Group brings together the EC-EIB-WB-IFCI M F for high-level consultations semi-annually since 2002 to discuss common strategic and operational issues in the region.

program. More recently, it has increased i t s support to the education sector, alongside with the Bank,
with a euro 200 million contribution in 2009. The total current program o f the EIB i s 744 million Euros
(equivalent to $1,101 million) to cover a three year period.

13.
The Morocco program o f the African Development Bank (AfDB) makes it the largest o f all
the AfDB’s client countries with total financing to date reaching $9 billion. The program i s forecast
to continue to grow. Having delivered $327 million (220 million SDR) in new lending in 2008, it aims to
more than double this to $745 million (500 million SDR) in 2009. The strategy for the AfDB in Morocco
for the period 2007-201 1 was assessed at the mid-term point in 2009 and confirmed as being on-track and
appropriate. I t i s focused on three pillars: (1) strengtheningof governance; (2) development and upgrade
of infrastructure and enterprises; and (3) promotion of human development.

-

14.
The French development agency Agence Francaise de DCveloppement (AFD) - has been
present in Morocco since 1992 and has focused its assistance on: (1) support to the social sectors
(education and health); (2) private sector development; and (30 infrastructure investments in roads,
transport and energy. AFD’s strategy for 2007-2009 provided 460 million Euros ($680 million) and this
i s expected to increase for the 2010-2012 period. In 2007, AFD disbursed $187 million in assistance of
which $125 million went to Government with the rest allocated to non-state actors such as the private
sector and NGOs. Increasingly, the program of AFD will place an accent on non-sovereign financing.
15.
Morocco i s the largest recipient o f Spanish development financing with disbursements
estimated by Spain in the context o f the 2008 Survey on the Paris Declaration at $285 million in
2007. The Spanish program i s unique in Morocco because it involves multiple actors including both
central government and decentralized regional governments in Spain that each have their own programs
with central government in Morocco and decentralizedregional entities (e.g. Tangiers municipality). The
program i s focused on three main sectors: (1) basic social needs - health, education, water, housing; (2)
governance and institutional strengthening; and (3) economic development. Spain i s also orientating
some of i t s development financing towards budget support and i s planning to deliver budget support in
the health sector, in harmonizationwith the EU program.
16.
The Millennium ChallenPe Account (MCA) was agreed by the United States with Morocco
in August 2007, for a five year period and for a total amount of US$696 million. This marked a
major new chapter in the relationship between Morocco and the United States and substantially
supplements the USAID program, which disbursed $20 million in 2007. The MCA focuses on
contributing to enhance economic growth, by increasing productivity as well as improving employment,
and has the following components: (1) investing in fruit tree productivity (US$300 million); (2) smallscale fisheries (US$ 116 million); (3) artisan crafts and Fez medina (US$ 112 million); (4) financial
services and support to enterprises (USD 80 million); and (5) administrative, monitoring and evaluation
(USD 88 million).

Appendix 7

Appendix 7: TRUST FUND MANAGEMENT
1.
The Bank’s program makes significant use of Trust Fund (TF) financing, mainly in support
of analytical work. This has facilitated the Bank’s ability to respond to government requests for support
and address emerging development issues in a flexible and prompt manner. The TF program has helped
the Bank deliver a broader knowledge program, including in some cutting-edge areas, and to pilot
innovative approaches. This knowledge then feeds into the design o f Bank projects and programs. The
audience includes policy-makers, academics, Bank staff, private sector, multilateral and bilateral donors.
2.
This CPS will build on this foundation, ensuring that TFs adapt to support the objectives o f
the strategy. The program will be guided by the following principles: (i)ownership by government; (ii)
alignment with CPS objectives; (iii)complementary to other Bank activities; (iv) findings disseminated to
inform the design of future national and donor-supported programs, and (v) selectivity in deployment.

3.
The TF program i s organized according to CPS pillars. This alignment facilitates
assessment o f results. The total TF portfolio comprises 26 activities amounting to $64.5 million in ten
sectors (public sector management, social protection, transport, health, education, human development,
climate change, agriculture, water, energy and inclusion). O f this, $43.2 million i s for one GEF-financed
project supporting and integrated solar combined-cycle power plant. Other sizeable activities in the TF
portfolio in terms o f financing include the GPOBA pilots for water supply and sanitation (total o f $7
million), the GEF Africa Stockpile program ($4 million) and a JSDF grant for capacity building to
improve schooling for the poor ($2.2 million). The rest of the portfolio ($8.1 million) i s aimed at
knowledge services and capacity building.
4.
TF supported activities provide valuable analytical underpinnings for IBRD’s DPL
programs. Areas that benefit include public sector management, the energy sector, and the water sector.
The education sector has made innovative use of TFs by supporting the testing o f Conditional Cash
Transfer (CCT) pilots for rural schools which aim to improve the transparency, accountability and
effectiveness of service delivery in the education sector. Related analytical work influences education
policy reforms supported through the Education DPL. The lessons learnt from the CCT pilot and its
evaluation are expected to be useful to the broader development community in Morocco. TFs on climate
change, a priority CPS area, have expanded. They help develop a better understanding among Moroccan
decision makers and development partners o f the impacts o f CC and the policy measures or other actions
needed to respond. They use participatory research techniques for building analytical models and
predictive scenarios. They help define work that can be carried out under forthcoming projects.
