1.
M a l i i s one o f the poorest countries in the world due to i t s limited resource base, landlocked status, vulnerability to external shocks, poor infrastructure, l o w levels o f human
development and weak administrative capacity. Despite these constraints, M a l i has made
commendable progress on the economic, political and social fronts over the past decade.
Annual real growth rates for 1994-2002 averaged about 5 percent. The private sector i s
increasingly playing a much larger role in the economy, and civil society and stakeholders
are strengthening partnerships with Government with greater responsibility for development
activities. M a l i has also recorded important improvements in certain social indicators since
the mid-1990s which indicates that it should make progress towards meeting some o f the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
In parallel with this progress, M a l i achieved a remarkable political transformation
2.
with an increasingly strong democratic process taking root throughout the 1990s, culminating
in the peaceful transfer o f power between two democratically elected leaders in 2002. This
has placed M a l i in the forefront o f African countries moving to a truly democratic and
pluralistic political system and provides a strong platform for pushing forward on further
economic and institutional reforms under the leadership o f a committed Government. While
governance, capacity and institutions s t i l l need strengthening, the overall framework for a
more effective, transparent and decentralized administration i s gradually taking shape.

3.

Board Discussion. The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
0
I s the proposed program an appropriate support to the implementation o f Mali’s
PRSP?
0
I s the proposed approach to programmatic lending and PRSCs suitable?
0
Are the triggers applied to the CAS for the base, high and l o w cases appropriate?
0
Does the CAS identify sufficient mitigating measures to address the risks,
including the risk posed by the impacts o f the crisis in C6te d’Ivoire?

4.
PRSP. M a l i recently finalized i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) which
lays out a comprehensive strategy for fighting poverty and provides a cohesive framework
for all donors and development partners. The issue o f sustained and equitable growth i s the
cornerstone o f the PRSP. Despite achieving strong average growth rates since 1994, there i s
a considerable degree o f fluctuation in the annual growth rates, e.g. the growth rate i s
estimated to drop from 9.7 percent in 2002 to -1.1 percent in 2003. This i s a result o f the
economy’s vulnerability to external factors such as unfavorable climatic conditions, terms o f
trade shocks and record l o w prices in the cotton sector due to cotton subsidies in the US and
Europe. In addition to these traditional vulnerabilities, Mali’s economy in 2002-3 was
severely affected by the crisis in neighboring CGte d’Ivoire which disrupted transport, trade,
investment and private sector activity in the western Africa region. Continued strong support
from the international community i s needed to help M a l i manage these external shocks,
sustain robust growth and make progress o n achieving the PRSP goals and the MDGs.
The implementation o f the Bank’s FY99-01 CAS has been satisfactory as M a l i
5.
fulfilled nearly all o f the triggers in the base case scenario and most o f the triggers in the high
case scenario. The CAS focused on supporting stable economic growth and sustainable
human development. The Bank supported Mali’s macroeconomic stabilization, economic

- iv liberalization and structural reforms and invested in economic diversification and
infrastructure, particularly in the rural sector. These interventions contributed to the strong
economic growth rates since 1998. At the same time, the Bank provided financial and
technical support to the health and education programs in M a l i which facilitated the
improvement in some social indicators. Moreover, during the previous CAS period, M a l i
reached the Completion Points o f the Original and Enhanced HIPC Initiatives in September
2002 and March 2003, respectively. The debt r e l i e f provided under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative was sufficient to allow the debt sustainability ratio to drop to an acceptable level.
6.
Objectives. The progress achieved to date and the continued reform program
outlined in the PRSP provide an excellent starting point for the Bank’s CAS for FY04-06.
The CAS i s fully aligned with the PRSP and selectively focuses on three main themes which
promoting growth; (ii)
developing human resources;
directly support the PRSP pillars: (i)
and (iii)
public finance management and governance. The CAS combines a mix o f Bank
instruments including: (i)
programmatic support (through SWAPs and PRSCs);
(ii)
community driven development operations; (iii)
specific lending operations that target
the growth objective and support necessary infrastructure; and (iv) a wide-ranging AAA
program which i s focused on building the knowledge base for the three main themes. In
particular, the CAS concentrates on capacity building and strengthening the framework for
programmatic support to Mali: firstly, to strengthen the sector-wide approaches in the social
sectors and, moving on from there, to finalize the necessary core diagnostic work and
establish the appropriate framework for a full move to PRSCs.

7.
Lending Scenarios. M a l i i s currently in the base case. The base-case scenario
allocates up to US$390 million, o f which up to 29 percent could be in the form o f IDA grants
during IDA-13. This scenario i s predicated o n continued good macroeconomic performance,
satisfactory implementation o f the PRSP, progress on strengthening governance and strong
portfolio performance. Lending could increase to US$462 million under the high-case
scenario if there i s accelerated progress on these criteria. It i s possible for M a l i to reach the
high case given: (i)
i t s strong track record in implementingmacroeconomic and structural
that the PRSP provides a more comprehensive and cohesive framework than in
reforms; (ii)
the past, focusing on outcomes and the MDGs; and (iii)
that progress on key sectors - such
as health and education - has been strong since 1998, providing a solid platform for
continued good performance and achievement o f PRSP targets, particularly with stronger
programmatic support from donors in the years ahead.
8.
Risks. The implementation o f the CAS faces several risks: (i)
natural risks from
adverse climatic conditions which influence agricultural output; (ii)
volatility o f commodity
prices, exacerbated by agricultural subsidies in the industrialized countries; (iii)
uncertain
external assistance; (iv) continued negative impacts o f the CBte d’Ivoire crisis; and (v) weak
capacity. The Bank will take all necessary steps described in the CAS to help mitigate these
risks.

9.
Measuring Results. The CAS focuses on defining and measuring results in the
framework o f the overall monitoring and evaluation o f the PRSP. The CAS measurable
indicators are the PRSP targets for 2006 which focus on making progress towards the MDGs.
In parallel with the annual PRSP Progress Reports and related JSAs, the Bank will assess the
achievements o f the CAS.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The last ten years have witnessed significant economic and political change in Mali.
Since 1994, economic growth rates have averaged more than 5 percent. This strong
performance was the result o f a series o f macroeconomic stabilization, economic
liberalization and structural reforms that were supported by the World Bank, IMF and other
donors. The comprehensive reform program has transformed Mali’s economy into a marketoriented one where the private sector i s playing an increasingly important role, thus laying a
more solid foundation for accelerated growth.
2.
In parallel with the positive economic developments, the political landscape in M a l i
has also been transformed. In 1991, the 23-year dictatorship o f General Moussa TraorC was
overthrown and President Konare was democratically elected a year later. Since then, M a l i
has been characterized by an increasingly stable democracy, culminating in the 2002
elections won by President TourC. This peaceful transfer o f power betweentwo
democratically elected leaders was a first in Mali’s history and places M a l i in the forefront o f
African countries moving to a truly democratic and pluralistic political system.
Notwithstanding this progress, M a l i remains one o f the poorest countries in the world
3.
and i s ranked 164 out o f 173 countries in the 2002 U N D P Human Development Index. The
country’s limited resource base, land-locked status, vulnerability to external shocks, underdeveloped infrastructure, l o w levels o f human development and weak administrative capacity
combine to create difficult social and economic conditions. In 2001,63.8 percent o f the
population was estimated to be living in poverty. Between 75 and 80 percent o f Mali’s
population o f 11.3 million lives in rural areas and i s dependent on agriculture. The economy
i s vulnerable to recurrent drought, poor environmental conditions and large fluctuations in
international commodity prices. However, while Mali’s social indicators remain among the
poorest in the world, some are showing progress, particularly since 1998 (see Table 1).
Building on and strengtheningthis progress will be critical for M a l i as it faces major
challenges in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (see Attachment 1 for details).
M a l i reached the Completion Points o f the Original and Enhanced HIPC Initiatives in
4.
September 2000 and March 2003, respectively. The debt r e l i e f provided to M a l i under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative was sufficient to allow the debt sustainability ratio to drop to an
acceptable level. In M a y 2002, the Government adopted the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) which lays out a comprehensive strategy for fighting poverty and provides a
strong and cohesive framework for all donors and development partners. The Bank’s FY0406 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s designed to support the PRSP. The Bank’s strategy
builds on the lessons learnt from implementingthe previous CAS and i s based on the
outcome o f a one-year consultative process with representatives from central and local
Government, civil society, private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other
development partners. The PRSP, with the support o f the Bank’s CAS, provides a solid
framework for moving towards achieving the MDGs.

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND PROSPECTS
A.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)

5.
The PRSP was adopted by the previous Government in M a y 2002 and then
reconfirmed by the new Government (GoM) in October 2002. The overall macroeconomic
framework was then updated to take into account the impacts o f the C8te d’Ivoire crisis and
was endorsed by the Bretton Woods institutions in March 2003. The strategic axes o f the
PRSP are as follows:
e

Pre-Requisite Pillar: Accelerated and Re-Distributive Growth. The growth objective
i s the cornerstone o f the PRSP and must be sufficiently robust to ensure successful
implementation o f the PRSP. To achieve growth, the G o M aims to continue
macroeconomic and structural reforms and to facilitate the diversification o f production
and exports through strengthening the supporting framework for development o f the
private sector as the prime engine o f economic growth.

e

Pillar 1: Promote institutional development while improving governance and
participation. Within a context o f decentralization, the G o M aims to reinforce
institutional capabilities, improve public sector management through modernization and
reform, combat corruption, strengthen the rule o f l a w and the judiciary system, and
reinforce c i v i l society.

e

Pillar 2: Develop human resources and improve access to quality basic services.
The strategy concentrates not only on improved, decentralized health (including
population and nutrition) and education service delivery, but also o n complementary
living standard aspects, such as housing, water, and sanitation, as well as employment,
social protection, and gender.

e

Pillar 3: Develop basic infrastructure and productive sectors. This pillar integrates
the following development challenges: (i)
improved transportation, energy,
a diverse and competitive
communications, and industrial zone infrastructure; (ii)
primary sector that i s able to provide food security and national resource management;
and (iii)
a business environment favorable to private sector development able to actively
contribute to economic growth.

The G o M translated the ambitious program laid out in the PRSP into the 2003-2005
6.
program-budget. The PRSP builds upon a widespread consultative process (Box 1) and i t s
poverty diagnostic i s based o n the availability o f service delivery, spatial analysis and the
effects o f poverty o n health and education. Growth is the under-pinningo f the PRSP and the
three PRSP pillars target poverty reduction while identifying specific measures needed to
integrate the poor and reduce gender as well as rural and urban disparities.

7.

Assessment of the PRSP. The PRSP provides an overall credible poverty reduction
strategy. According to the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), the following are the strongest
areas o f the PRSP: (i)
the consultative and participatory process, notwithstanding the large
size o f the country and i t s thinly spread population (see B o x 1); (ii)
the poverty analysis,

-3despite the limited availability o f data; (iii)
the comprehensiveness o f the strategy and i t s
focus on macroeconomic stability, high and sustainable growth, human development, the
strengthening o f access to basic social services, private sector development and good
governance; (iv) the efforts to draw up a long-term strategic vision consistent with sectoral
strategies; and (v) the attempt to cost the strategy. The PRSP also makes a notable
assessment o f the risks associated with the implementation o f the strategy, including Mali’s
vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
Box 1: The Participatory Process During the Preparation o f the PRSP

I

The PRSP clearly lays out the process followed in its preparation, which has drawn from and built upon a
tradition o f implementing consensus-based policies and debating major issues and strategies. Consultation
activities for the formulation o f the PRSP included two notable elements. First, eleven thematic discussion
and working groups were established under an overall National Technical Committee. Second, consultations
on the draft PRSP were held at the national level, in each o f the eight regions, and in the district o f Bamako.
This approach resulted in the identificationand inclusion in the PRSP o f the major development constraints
and strengths o f each region, the consideration o f certain specific regional issues in PRSP projects and
programs, the buy-in to the PRSP process by regional and local actors, and the establishment o f regional and
local committees to steer and implement the PRSP. However, hrther work i s required to mainstream
participationand consensus building in the management o f public affairs and to strengthen and sustain the
dialogue with the poor during the consultation process. Development partners also played a key role in this
process, notably the UNDP, the European Commission, the Netherlands, Canada, USAID, Sweden, and
Belgium.
[Source: Joint StaffAssessment, (JSA) M a l i PRSP 20031

8.
The JSA noted a number o f areas where the PRSP could be improved. First, there i s
a need to deepen the policy analysis once the expenditure data from the 2001 household
survey becomes available in 2003 (see B o x 2). Second, while there i s a comprehensive
coverage o f the development challenges, there i s a lack o f prioritization in outlining them.
The G o M i s beginning to prioritize, as exemplified by the framework letter introduced by the
President to the G o M in October 2002, where employment, health, education, and increasing
purchasing power were indicated as Mali’s top four priorities. Third, the G o M needs to
ensure that components o f all existing sector strategies are adequately reflected in the PRSP
(notably those for transport, drinking water supply and sanitation, urban development, and
soil fertility). Fourth, there i s a need to reinforce and build upon existing mechanisms to
monitor and evaluate strategy implementation and outcomes. Finally, the PRSP proposes a
widening o f the economic base to better withstand external shocks (climate, regional
instability, international commodity prices) and emphasizes that growth should be driven by
the private sector with a strong foreign investment focus. I t i s critical for M a l i to develop
new sources o f growth through diversification o f the agricultural base into fmits, vegetables
and Arabic gum, development o f agri-business and transformation o f agricultural products
(i.e. textiles), expansion o f mining, development o f the tourism and handicrafts industries and
promotion o f small and medium-sized enterprises in services, communications and other
non-agricultural sectors. However, a clear, integrated strategy on pro-poor growth, including
diversification o f growth sources, has yet to be articulated.

-4Box 2: Poverty, Social Indicators and the MDGs

While the income indicator data o f the 2001 survey have not been h l l y aggregated and analyzed, it i s expected
:hat thepoverty level on an income basis will be less than the 70 percent recorded in 1996: this reduction i s
:xpected as a result o f the strong average real GDP growth rate o f 5% since the 1994 devaluation. According
:o an access-to-services index constructed from the 2001 household survey data, 63.8% o f the population were
:stimated to be living in poverty in 2001. On this basis, poverty affects 75.9% of the rural population, versus
mly 30.1% o f the urban population. Poverty levels are the lowest in Bamako with only 28.6% o f the
population considered poor, while the highest levels are in Kidal with 92.8% o f the residents being poor. In
terms o f poverty depth, the region o f Mopti has the highest rate of 53.1% while Bamako has the lowest o f
14.8%.
Gender Issues and Poverty. Gender analysis o f poverty reveals a strong interconnection o f the status and
Dpportunities available to women and overall poverty. For example, maternal and child mortality rates
significantly drop with the rise in the level o f the mother’s education; the more educated mother i s also more
aware o f contraception possibilities. According to a 1997 survey led by the Observatory for Employment and
rraining, women make up 65% o f the informal sector but only 32.75% o f the formal sector. While a full
gender analysis does not yet exist for employment, according to the 2001 Demographic and Health Survey,
40% o f women (aged 15 to 49) work in agriculture, o f whom only 58% are paid for their work. For the
remaining 60% who do not work in agriculture, only 8% are not paid for their work.
Health and education indicators in Mali, despite improvements, are among the lowest in the world with a
significant disparity between rural and urban areas as demonstrated by the access-to-servicesindex described
above. Fewer rural children attend school, notably fewer girls, and rural infant and child mortality rates are
significantly higher than in urban areas. The poor are less likely to use health services, particularlythe rural
poor, and tend to spend proportionately less on health care. The 2001 Demographic and Health Survey
confirms that health behaviors are influenced by the mother’s education level and access to basic services and
information.

Mali i s expected to face a major challenge in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as there
i s (i)
weak capacity in delivering basic services; (ii) poor cross-sectoral integration o f activities; and (iii)long
delays in carrying out policy reforms. As shown in Attachment 1, there i s a lack o f baseline data for many
goals. Achievement o f the goals, however, i s further complicated by the lack o f an integrated strategy to do
so, reflecting the multisectoral aspect o f reaching MDGs. For example, the 2001 Demographic and Health
Survey revealed that health conditions are tightly related to factors outside o f the health sector, such as
monetary income. However, the PRSP treats such issues as child mortality as a health issue. Despite these
constraints, there has been an important positive trend since 1997/98 in improving certain health and education
indicators as shown in Table 1.

Box 2: Poverty, Social Indicators and the MDGs (cont’d)
The 2002 PRSP concentrates on developing basic social services (Le. primary school education, basic health
infrastructure) which would set the foundations for a solid development framework. At the same time, the
Ministry of Health staff acknowledgedthe need for the multi-sectoral approach and efforts are intensifying
toward articulatingsuch an approach and the accompanying institutional mechanisms to support it. I t i s
expected that once more o f the framework i s in place, progress will accelerate. Therefore, while M a l i i s unlikely
to reach many o f the MDGs by 2015, it still may achieve several, notably education enrollment rates,
particularly as M a l i i s eligible for the Education-For-All (EFA) initiative. With resource constraints being
lifted as a result o f additional external support under EFA, the challenge will be to reinforce the capacity and
enabling administrative environment to successfully implement the GoM’s strategy and use available resources
to reach the MDGs.

I

The environmental and sanitation MDGs also will need considerable attention from the GoM to make progress.
Increasing population pressures and urbanization will lead to large additional investment needs for water supply
facilities and require increased attention to environmental issues to ensure that Mali’s development remains
sustainable.

Mali needs to produce reliable, robust and current statistics in order to monitor progress towards the MDGs. The
establishment o f an effective Monitoring & Evaluation framework i s a core focus o f the Bank’s and donors’
work in the context o f their support to the PRSP.

PRSP Pre-Requisite Pillar: Accelerated and Re-Distributive Growth

Recent Macro-Economic and Growth Performance
9.
The PRSP was prepared after a decade-long period o f growth and good macroeconomic performance. Despite a number o f adverse shocks, real GDP growth has averaged
about 5 percent per annum between 1994-2002, enabling real per capita GDP to rise by 2.5
percent per year. The G o M has been successful at limiting inflation to single-digit figures
and reining in the fiscal deficit in line with the convergence obligations under the West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) regional integration agreement. M a l i
also made good progress on revenue generation with revenues reaching more than 17% o f
GDP (well above the Sub-Saharan Africa average).

-6Mali’s economic performance remains fragile in view o f the economy’s vulnerability
10.
to climatic conditions, fluctuating terms o f trade, dependence o n ports in neighboring
countries and the concentration o f i t s exports in three primary sector products’. The
favorable average real growth experienced since the 1994 devaluation masks significant
annual volatility. Economic growth f e l l to 3.5 percent in 2001 owing to the cotton sector
crisis and difficulties in food crop production. However, GDP growth in 2002 rebounded
and i s estimated at 9.7 percent due to the sharp increase in gold, cotton and cereal production.
The fluctuations in growth reflect Mali’s economic structure, which i s biased towards
agriculture (the main source o f livelihood for 75-80% o f the population) and services. These
two sectors accounted for 38% and 36% o f GDP, respectively, in 2001. Mali’s economy i s
relatively outward looking, with trade in goods representing around 53% o f GDP in 2002.
The share o f manufacturing in GDP and exports has been limited, due to l o w productivity,
high costs and l o w quality o f basic services (energy, water, telecommunications), high
overall transaction costs o f doing business, and a financial sector inadequately oriented to
serve as intermediary between savings and investments.
Mali’s macroeconomic performance can be attributed to the effective implementation
11.
o f macroeconomic stabilization and economic liberalization policies since the 1994
devaluation o f the CFA franc which created the foundations o f a market-led economy and
encouraged private sector development. Recent economic developments have been
influenced, however, by weak performance of the country’s cotton sector (see B o x 3). The
sector, which achieved impressive growth and significant gains in the world export market
share following the 1994 devaluation, experienced a severe financial and structural crisis in
2000 in the wake o f the falling international cotton price. Coverage o f the sector’s losses by
transfers from the budget to the cotton parastatal company (Compagnie Malienne pour le
De‘veloppement des Textiles), risked derailing Mali’s otherwise satisfactory fiscal and
economic performance over a decade-long process of economic and structural reforms. The
emergence o f gold as Mali’s leading export product since 1999 has fortunately helped
mitigate some o f the negative impact o f the cotton sector crisis.
Significant market reforms have been achieved during the 1990s, beginning with the
12.
liberalization o f grain markets, the easing o f price controls and the implementation o f proinvestment policies to remove distortions in the incentive framework. More recent measures
include the application as o f January 1,2000 of the common external tariff (CET) under the
WAEMU agreement, which reduced import duties below a 20% ceiling and greatly
simplified the tariff structure. To modernize the tax system and offset the potential customs
revenue loss related to the introduction o f the CET, the G o M successfully implemented a
comprehensive tax reform program with Canadian assistance, including introduction o f the
value added tax and simplification o f the tax structure. The economy responded positively to
these changes which reinforced the significant positive growth trend emanating from the
1994 devaluation. The combined effect o f these policies has created the foundations o f a
market-led economy and encouraged private sector development.

Gold and cotton together comprise over 80 percent o f export earnings, while livestock - exported primarily to West Africa
regional markets - accounts for about 8 percent o f export earnings. Cotton has historically been the number one export
earner ahead o f gold, although gold has only recently surpassed cotton export revenues and today accounts for about 55
percent o f export receipts.

-7Mali’s macroeconomic performance has generally been within the GoM’s targets and
13.
it has managed to attract both multilateral and bilateral funds aimed at deepening structural
reforms and enhancing its socio-economic situation. The fifth review o f Mali’s PRGF
concluded in February 2003 that M a l i continued to implement i t s program in a satisfactory
manner in the first nine months o f 2002. All the quantitative performance criteria,
benchmarks, and financial performance indicators were observed. The structural
performance criteria and structural benchmarks for 2002 were also met. The sound
macroeconomic performance was achieved in the face o f a downward adjustment in
expenditures (except for priority poverty reducing items) in line with a shortfall in revenues
owing to the Cote d’Ivoire crisis. The sixth and final review i s underway and i s expected to
be completed by August 2003. The Bank i s continuing to work closely with the IMF in
supporting the PRSP, including monitoring debt sustainability in the post-completion point
framework, and cooperating on public expenditure management and cotton sector reforms.
Box 3: The Cotton Sector and the Reform Program

Cotton production in Mali has expanded remarkably in the years following the devaluation o f the CFA Franc
in 1994, from 293,021 tons o f seed cotton in 1994/95 to 522,903 tons in 199811999 and 459,123 tons in
1999/2000. In the 1990s, Mali became the first exporter o f cotton lint in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, from
1999 to 2001, the sector experienced a severe financial crisis, due in part to the fall in world cotton prices and
also to weak management o f CMDT, the cotton parastatal company. The crisis took a dramatic turn in June
2000 with the decision o f a large number o f farmers to boycott cotton cultivation for the 2000/2001 cropping
season due to the fact that CMDT was offering a relatively low price for seed cotton because o f i t s financial
difficulties. As a result, production for 2000/2001 decreased to 241,000 tons o f seed cotton, i.e. barely more
than half the production o f the previous year.
With the support o f the World Bank, the GoM prepared and adopted a comprehensive restructuring plan for
the cotton sector. This plan was approved in October 2001 and spells out the long-term vision for a
competitive model for the sector and the structural changes needed to make the transition from the monopsony
organization and restore the sector’s profitability, sustainability and competitiveness. It includes: (i)the
downsizing o f CMDT, as well as structural reforms to change the sector’s organization; (ii)
disengaging the
state and involving the private sector and farmers associations; (iii)breaking up the monopoly into regional
entities through the sale o f agro-industrial assets to private operators; and (iv) liberalizing seed and oil trade
through, inter alia, privatization o f the oil seed company. The GoM established a unit, the Mission de
Restructuration du Secteur Coton (MRSC), reporting directly to the Prime Minister, to manage the
implementation o f the restructuring plan. The reform program i s supported by the Bank’s Third Structural
Adjusfment Credit (SAC-3): the latest supervision o f the SAC-3 indicated that the cotton sector reforms are
broadly on track.
As far as the next stages o f the reform process are concerned, the MRSC and the GoM indicated that it i s
preparing a comprehensive plan to lead to the full privatizatiodliberalization o f the sector by 2005/2006, as
foreseen in the letter o f sector policy development. This plan would comprise: (i)
the full privatization o f
CMDT in the next 12 to 18 months (ii)the full liberalization o f the sector over a 3-4 year transition period,
allowing for several key functions to be progressively and safely transferred to the private sector and farmers
organizations; and (iii)continued and increased support to institutional and capacity-building activities.
At the same time as Mali has been making commendable progress on cotton sector reform, the world cotton
industry i s suffering through one o f its most painful periods for producers in developing countries. Average
international cotton prices last season were the lowest since 1972-73 and, when adjusted for inflation, rank as
the lowest in history, halving the incomes o f many developing country cotton producers. Subsidies to
agricultural producers in the United States and the European Union are the single biggest force driving down
world prices and Sub-Saharan Africa i s most deeply affected. The cotton farmers o f western and central
Africa are among the lowest cost producers in the world. Yet, despite this comparative advantage, the cotton
industry in Africa i s losing world market share and cotton farmers are falling further into poverty.

-8Box 3: The Cotton Sector and the Reform Program (cont’d)

According to analysis conductedjointly by the World Bank, the IMF and the International Cotton Advisory
Committee, cotton producers in developing countries face annual losses o f about US$9.5 billion as a result o f
subsidies benefiting rich countries. Total losses to developing country producers have amounted to US$23
billion over the past four years. Removal o f direct subsidies worldwide would have a net positive effect o f 3 1
cents per pound on average international cotton prices. Despite the successful efforts of the cotton industry to
expand the demand for cotton, which will reach a record in 2002-2003, and despite an expected reduction o f
supply and higher economic growth in major economies, excess productionwill continue to affect prices in
international markets and cotton prices are expected to remain well below the long-run average for the next
several years.

Future Policy Orientation.

14.
The G o M aims to continue structural reforms to: (i)
promote strong and sustainable
economic growth; (ii)
reduce poverty and raise living standards in the long term; and
(iii)
ensure financial viability in the medium term. New sources o f growth will need to be
promoted, as cotton and gold production alone will be insufficient to ensure high sustainable
growth. In addition to promoting diversification o f export products, the G o M intends to
encourage and support efforts in processing o f primary products prior to sale domestically or
in export markets. Particular emphasis i s being placed on targeting the West African
regional market where some o f Mali’s potential export products have a comparative
advantage. Efforts will also be intensifiedto improve facilitation o f trade and transport
systems. The G o M i s working towards continuing to improve market mechanisms and
toward establishing a sound and transparent judicial and regulatory environment conducive
to national and foreign private investment, as well as to increased investment in infrastructure
and human resource development. Monetary policy, consistent with the fixed exchange rate
o f the WAEMU, will aim to increase the efficiency o f the banking system by improving
financial intermediation. The G o M intends to continue to promote the sound development o f
micro-finance, in particular by reinforcing the supervisory capacity. I t also intends to better
manage new loan commitments through, inter alia, pursuing financing sources that maximize
the grant element o f future commitments.
Macroeconomic Outlook.
Mali’s current dependency on a narrow export base and i t s high vulnerability to
15.
drought and international commodity markets make the achievement o f sustained growth
fragile. The growth prospects for 2003 are less favorable than anticipated as a result o f a
combination o f external factors: (i)
insufficient rainfall at the start o f the 2002-03 season2,
(ii)
depressed world prices for cotton, (iii)
expected decline in gold production (given
current information on reserves), and (iv) negative impacts from the crisis in CBte d’Ivoire
with respect to trade, transport, public finances and Malian workers’ remittances from CBte
d’Ivoire. Beyond 2003, two macroeconomic scenarios have been prepared based on different
assumptions about the impact o f the crisis in neighboring CBte d’Ivoire.

As a result, cotton production i s now expected to fall by about 25 percent to 430,000 tons, instead o f remaining at the
2001/02 level o f 571,000 tons, and cereal production i s forecast to fall by 3.7 percent.

-90

Base-Line Scenario: The assumption i s that the effects o f the closing o f the BamakoAbidjan corridor will fade gradually during the third quarter o f 2003 and that economic
activities will return to their usual level by the end o f the year.
Downside Scenario: Even with a return to a tenuous peace in C6te d’Ivoire, it i s
possible that the crisis in C6te d’Ivoire will continue to have a negative impact
throughout 2003 and beyond as it could take time to re-open the Bamako-Abidjan trade
corridor and for the Ivoirian economy to regain momentum and positively impact
neighboring economies such as Mali.

16.
Base-Line Scenario. The macroeconomic framework presented in the PRSP was
revised by the authorities late in 2002 and the medium-term projections were adjusted
accordingly. The 2003 growth rate has been revised downward to -1.1 percent. Growth i s
expected to rebound in 2004 (see Annex l),
and to average 3.5 percent a year over the
period 2003-05 as against 5.0 percent a year over the period 1994-2002. Potential sources o f
this growth are expected to come from developing the industrial sector, especially for textiles
and agribusinesses, from diversifying the agricultural export base into fruits, vegetables and
Arabic gum, from expanding mining, from developing the tourism and handicrafts industries,
and from promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in services. Inflation i s estimated to
average 3.0 percent over the period 2003-05, and the external current account deficit
(excluding official transfers) to narrow from an average 11 percent o f GDP over 2000-02 to
seven percent over 2003-05.
Underpinningthe projections for growth i s the assumption that M a l i will be able to
17.
attract foreign savings, including private capital, to supplement domestic saving. Gross
domestic saving would remain at a historically high level over the next few years, partly as a
result o f higher government saving, and average about 14 percent o f GDP a year over the
next 3-6 years. However, this growth rate will be insufficient to finance total domestic
investment, which i s projected to average about 22 percent o f GDP a year. Hence, M a l i will
s t i l l need to continue to attract a high level o f foreign investment, with annual net foreign
private capital inflows continuing to amount to about 2% percent o f GDP.

18.
Fiscal policy reflects the poverty reduction targets that the G o M defined in the PRSP.
This policy aims at increasing poverty-reducing expenditures while lowering the basic fiscal
deficit. In order to keep overall government spending at about 27% o f GDP, the authorities
intend to increase total government revenue by 1.8 percentage points o f GDP to 19.0% in
2003, with tax revenue rising by 1.6 percentage points o f GDP to 15.8%. About one-third o f
the improvement i s expected to be due to a recovery in tax receipts once the crisis in C6te
d’Ivoire has ended. In addition, the G o M will seek to broaden the tax base by rationalizing
the tax system, simplifying it for smaller enterprises, and increasing the efficiency o f the tax
administration. To reduce shortfalls in the mobilization o f domestic resources, the G o M will
ensure the strict application o f laws and regulations governing the granting o f tax exemptions
to businesses and, more generally, intensify anti-fraud efforts. The effectiveness o f the tax
reforms implemented in recent years will be assessed and additional measures will be
identified to help raise the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio. Measures will also be introduced to
improve the quality o f macroeconomic accounting and analysis. Nevertheless, under this
scenario, the G o M will need additional assistance in calendar year 2003 to support the
implementation o f the PRSP program; the Bank could provide assistance through a

- 10supplemental credit to the on-going SAC-3, provided that the G o M has outlined appropriate
actions to take to respond to the situation.
19.
Downside Scenario. This scenario assumes that the C8te d’Ivoire crisis would
further dampen economic activity and put upward pressure o n domestic prices. It would be
difficult to achieve the G o M revenue targets and higher expenditures would be needed to
address security and refugee considerations. The economy would be affected through the
direct impact o f higher transport costs on cotton competitiveness and by the indirect impact
o f lower income on demand for domestic goods. Real GDP growth beyond 2003 could be
negatively affected by up to 2 percentage points. There would be a corresponding increase in
the fiscal deficit, assuming the G o M was able to maintain the level o f social spending and
public investment. Meanwhile, government revenue would remain stable relative to GDP but
be lower in nominal terms. Under this scenario, it i s likely that G o M would require
additional assistance in calendar year 2004 to support the implementation o f the PRSP
program.
Debt Sustainability. M a l i reached the Completion Points o f the Original and
20.
Enhanced HIPC Initiatives in September 2000 and March 2003 respectively. The debt r e l i e f
provided to M a l i under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative allows the debt to fall to an acceptable
level, unless there i s a significant external shock. The net present value (NPV) o f Mali’s debt
i s projected to decrease from $1.5 billion at end-December 2002 to $1.1 billion in 2003. The
debt-to-export ratio i s projected to drop to 119% in 2003, rising to 142% in 2014, and
gradually declining thereafter. This assumes that the G o M will only take o n new loans under
concessional or highly concessional terms and that these loans are targeted to support
effective implementation o f the PRSP (see Attachment 3 for further details on debt
sustainability).

C.

PRSP Pillar 1: Promote Institutional Development While Improving
Governance and Participation

2 1.
The 2002 elections solidified the democratic process in Mali, and the formation o f a
multi-party Government in October 2002 provided a strong platform to push forward on
further institutional reform under the leadership o f President TourC. During the GoM’s first
Council o f Ministers meeting, President TourC challenged all Ministers to implement a
results-oriented development policy based on the PRSP and he emphasized that
strengthening governance would be his top priority. This confirmed recognition that M a l i
had been making important strides in improving governance and reforming institutions in the
past and, with the adoption o f the PRSP, this was again placed at center-stage.

The challenge laid down by the President i s ambitious as the Malian administration
22.
has been characterized to date by: (i)
slow decision-making; (ii)
insufficiently qualified
human resources with a lack o f appropriate material resources; and (iii)
a poorly adapted
development and institutional management framework, which has hampered the GoM’s
ability to elaborate effective development policy and mobilize the necessary resources.
Furthermore, planning and development structures are dispersed within different ministries
with inadequate coordination mechanisms between them. The judicial system i t s e l f i s
characterized by: (i)
complicated and costly procedures; (ii)
inadequate access, concentrated
in Bamako; (iii)
irrelevant legislation and regulation unable to keep up with social, political,
economic, cultural, and environmental changes; (iv) lack o f trained personnel combined with

- 11 a lack o f judicial inspection and accountability; and (v) unclear division between political
and administrative affairs within the judiciary system.

23.
Governance. In 1999, the GoM launched the National Policy to Fight Corruption.
Since then, implementation has been progressing, albeit at a slow pace due to the sheer
complexity o f the issues coupled with the weak judicial system. In July 2002, the GoM
formed an ad hoc committee on corruption as part o f the Prime Minister’s office, which led
to the Council o f Ministers’ adoption o f several committee recommendations to create and
strengthen internal inspections and limit procurement abuses. The committee’s work
benefited from the Bank-prepared “Recommendations to Reinforce the Anti-Corruption
Program” published in April 2002 at the GoM’s request. Efforts need to be enhanced to
implement further recommendations from the Report.
Public Expenditure Management. The GoM has made some strides in improving
24.
public finance management. Efficiency and efficacy in the budget preparation procedures
have improved since the introduction o f program-budgets in 1998 and the increase in the
number o f Inspectors and Magistrates. The Lois de Re‘glement 1997 to 2001 have been
produced, adopted by the Cabinet and submitted to Parliament for approval. In addition,
improved inspections and a newly adopted nomenclature have increased transparency and
monitoring o f budget implementation. The GoM i s committed to strengthening these reforms
and to implementing the recommendations o f the World Bank-led2002-3 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA). As part o f the HIPC Expenditure Tracking Assessment,
the GoM has made very strong progress on implementing measures outlined in the related
action plan to improve public expenditure management, and has just created a ve‘rzjkateur
inde‘pendunt, similar to a general accounting office. Furthermore, the GoM i s preparing a
referendum to separate the section des comptes from the Supreme Court to create an
independent Cour des Comptes (a judicial court).

With the 2003 Budget, the authorities have introduced a three-year medium-term
25.
expenditure framework. A procedures manual for budget execution has been prepared and
internal audit functions have been strengthened. Also, the capabilities o f the Court o f
Accounts have been strengthened with additional staff and new facilities to enable clearing
the backlog o f work and ensuring timely completion o f responsibilities in the future. With a
view toward strengthening the budget information system, mechanisms to integrate the
computer systems o f the treasury, budget, and financial control departments are being
developed, and will be tested and installed in the coming year. Additional measures will be
pursued to ensure continued improvements in public expenditure management.

26.
Procurement. In 1995, the GoM implemented a public procurement code and
procurement regulations. While private sector procurement functions relatively well,
Government procurement suffers from inefficiency due to weak capacity in human and
administrative resources, and a lack o f decentralizationo f procurement procedures.
Corrective measures are being taken to improve transparency by reducing leeway for
subjective decision-making in public procurement procedures, and by filling in regulatory
and administrative gaps that could leave room for corruption. The GoM has also indicated
that it intends to strengthen monitoring structures to ensure that adopted codes and laws are
applied, as well as develop an ethics code. Improvement in human resource management and
an increased focus on the responsibility o f the public procurement body, combined with
greater vigilance among all stakeholders, will help fill this gap.

- 1227.
Participation. One o f the strengths o f the Malian democracy i s the developing
participative framework. Over seventy political parties exist and are grouped into three
major coalitions at the national level. C i v i l society i s vibrant with over 1,500 registered
NGOs and as many as 2,500 associations. The media are free and over thirty newspapers and
120 radio stations are operating. The recently created National Council o f C i v i l Society
Organizations o f M a l i should help channel civil society dialogue with G o M and the donor
community. In the framework o f the PRSP, it will be critical to institutionalize participatory
mechanisms that involve stakeholders in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f
poverty-oriented programs.
Decentralization and Deconcentration. In 1992, the G o M embarked on a
28.
participative decentralization process and there are now 703 local-level municipalities
(communes), 49 sub-regional districts (cercles), 8 regions and the district o f Bamako (with
the status o f a region). While the Mission for Decentralization and Institutional Reform
(MDRI) effectively piloted decentralization throughout the 1990s, the concomitant
deconcentration process lags behind. Effective and efficient decentralized government and
service delivery i s hampered by poor resource mobilization, weak capacity, inconsistency
between national sectoral programs and local development plans, poor governance and a
weak institutional framework. In response, the Commissariat for Institutional Development,
reporting to the new Junior Minister attached to the Prime Minister and charged with State
Reform and Institutional Relations, prepared an action plan through a participatory process in
January 2003 with the objective o f improving: (i)
central state reform and public sector
management; (ii)
decentralization and deconcentration; (iii)
human resource capacity
building; and (iv) communications and partnerships with service users.

D.

P R S P Pillar 2: Develop Human Resources and I m p r o v e Access to Quality Basic
Services

Health. Progress has been made in health since 1998 (Table 3). The G o M has
29.
reinforced i t s accountability and management capacity, notably through the preparation o f a
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) which costs programmed investments and
l i n k s activities to results in order to more effectively allocate resources towards achieving the
PRSP objectives and MDG targets (see Attachment 1). The attainment o f Original HIPC and
Enhanced HIPC Initiative targets encouraged an acceleration in reform implementation (e.g.
health personnel recruitment and a rise in budget allocations to the health sector). While
Mali’s health indicators are among the poorest in the world, the implementation o f the first
phase o f the ten-year health and social development program (PDDSS), which targets basic
health care and decentralized community management, has led to a significant improvement
in access to health care. The results are most notable for the poorest quintile, where infant
and child mortality rates dropped 23% and 24% respectively from 1996 to 2001.

However, health service utilization i s s t i l l l o w and the quality o f health care i s s t i l l
poor due to: (i)
unavailable and poorly trained personnel in regional and rural health centers;
(ii)
a lack o f supplies; (iii)
inaccessibility o f health centers outside o f Bamako; (iv) high
transaction costs for dealing with multiple donors which has exacerbated the Ministry o f
Health’s l o w absorptive capacity; and (v) poor resource allocation, including over-emphasis
on infrastructure investment without taking into account operating costs.

Education. Progress has also been made since 1998 in education (Table 4). To
reach the HIPC targets, difficult education reforms were enacted to focus attention on
primary schooling. Politically sensitive budget allocation reforms accelerated teacher
recruitment, the purchase o f teaching materials and classroom construction. The first phase
(PISE) o f the ten-year education program (PRODEC) continues to lay the groundwork for
improvement, particularly in primary education. The Ministry o f Education i s currently
preparing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), along similar lines to the MTEF
work in the health sector. This framework will encourage better donor coordination and thus
contribute to improved prospects for resource pooling.

Efforts should be intensified in the education sector to: (i)
improve access for the
32.
poorest; (ii)
improve education quality, including linkages between education, professional
training, and the current j o b market; (iii)
reinforce decentralized and deconcentrated
management; and (iv) reinforce overall institutional management. Moreover, the crosssectoral linkages between infrastructure levels (roads, transport) and accessibility to schools
also need to be enhanced. Despite some efforts3, teaching quality i s s t i l l poor and curricula
are often not pertinent to actual needs; for example, vocational training i s often more
theoretical than practical. Quality issues can, in part, be attributed to a lack o f access,
teaching
teachers (for example, the university student-to-professor ratio i s about 624: l),
One notable effort i s the successfkl Improving Learning in Primary Schools Program, which i s financed mostly by a Bank
LIL. Students are initially taught in a national language (materials are available in eleven out o f the thirteen) before French
i s introduced, using a dynamic pedagogy that differs from the traditional learning-by-rote.

-14materials, books, infrastructure, and laboratory equipment, as well as the poor organization o f
the Koranic school system. Moreover, high-school and university scholarships are poorly
and opaquely managed, often causing disruptive student strikes.
33,
The G o M has adopted measures to transfer health and education responsibilities from
the central to the regional and local levels and i s in the process o f establishing an appropriate
resource transfer mechanism, which would require substantial capacity building, particularly
at the regional and local levels. To be effective, the mechanism should foster greater
consistency between sectoral programs and local development plans as well as improvements
in local-level financial responsibility.
34.
Gender. As described in the poverty analysis in B o x 2, the inadequate opportunities
for women in Malian society contribute to the high levels o f poverty and, accordingly, gender
issues are at the forefront o f Malian policy. In 2002, the G o M adopted the Promotion o f
Women, Children, and Family Policy and Action Plan for 2002-2006. The first part o f this
document, which i s aligned with the PRSP, analyses health, education, the judicial system,
economic opportunities, the environment, and institutional development in terms o f gender,
while proposing priority actions for improving the situation o f women. One o f the most
important gender issues i s the higher HIV adult prevalence rate for women than for men
(Table 3) which needs specific attention.

E.

PRSP Pillar 3: Develop Basic Infrastructure and Productive Sectors

35.
Primary Productive Sectors. While the G o M has been implementing important
reforms for laying a solid framework for accelerated growth, M a l i suffers from a limited
resource base and i t s economy i s poorly diversified, with production concentrated heavily in
agriculture. Implementation o f agricultural policy i s guided by the 2000-20 10 National Rural
Development Master Plan as well as the 1999 National Environmental Action Plan which
were both integrated into the PRSP. A striking element o f Mali's economic performance
over the last decade i s that remarkable strides have been made in rural development by an
adequate combination o f policy reform, investment, technology improvements and strong
donor coordination. Perhaps most important have been the comprehensive reforms in the
cotton sector which include the partial restructuring and the proposed privatization o f the
national cotton company (CMDT, Compugnie Mulienne de De'veloppementdes Textiles) and
i t s cottonseed o i l subsidiary (HUICOMA, Huilerie CotonniBre du Mali). The details o f these
reforms are described in B o x 3. Another important success story has been the ongoing
reforms o f the OfJice du Niger that build on measures taken since the 1980s which have led
to a six-fold rise in rice production (see Attachment 2 for more details).
36.
A further identified growth area - livestock - i s being supported through the Pastoral
Charter, which i s currently under review by the National Assembly and which delineates
rights and responsibilities for farmers and herders, particularly property rights and access to
range resources and land use. To better tackle soil degradation, the G o M i s currently
preparing the National Soil Fertility Management Plan. As water management i s key to rural
development, the National Irrigation Strategy, prepared under the National Rural
Infrastructure Program (PNIR), mainly concentrates on large irrigation, and pilot actions and
operations are underway to expand small irrigation. There i s significant potential in
agricultural diversification into fruits, vegetables and Arabic gum, development o f agribusiness and transformation o f agricultural products (e.g. textiles). Other potential sources o f

-15growth exist in the expansion o f mining, development o f the tourism and handicrafts
industries and promotion o f small and medium-sized enterprises in services
37.
Private Sector Development. The G o M has concentrated on creating a legal and
regulatory framework conducive to private sector development. It has been able to attract
private investment in the gold, telecommunications, energy and water sectors, as well as
large external funding in infrastructure. Measures have been taken to harmonize the
legislative and regulatory environment under the Organization for the Harmonization o f
Business L a w in Africa (OHADA) Treaty; measures have also been taken to address core
labor standards (see Attachment 4). Furthermore, the G o M instituted a public enterprise
reform action plan for 1999-2002 in order to reduce the number o f state-owned enterprises
from thirty-three to eighteen. Currently, the G o M retains a majority holding in ten non-bank
enterprises and minority holding in eight. However, about 90% o f Mali’s economy s t i l l
remains in the informal sector. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) comprise a significant
share (over 65%, although largely informal) o f the private sector. Limited access to short,
medium and long-term credit instruments for business startup and investment i s a primary
constraint for SMEs. As highlighted in the JSA o f the PRSP, there i s a risk o f slower-thananticipated development o f the private sector into a dynamic engine o f growth. Therefore,
the G o M will need to continue to push ahead with reforms and incentives for developing the
private sector.
Financial Sector. Private sector development i s contingent upon financial sector
38.
development and access to sustainable finance. The G o M has been implementing various
reforms to improve confidence and competitiveness in the financial sector. In 1992, the
G o M began consolidating and liberalizing the state-owned and uncompetitive sector while
opening it up to competition and creating the necessary legal and regulatory framework for
sustainable growth. In 2001, the B M C D bank was restructured, privatized and merged with
BDM-SA to create the largest bank in M a l i and the twelfth largest bank in the UEMOA,
thereby increasing Mali’s presence in the regional financial market. The BIM-SA bank i s
currently being restructured and privatized. The G o M i s further creating a financial enabling
environment by continuing to lay the necessary legal and regulatory framework, especially
on a regional level (having adopted the Uniform Acts o f OHADA), diversifying the financial
sector to support non-bank financial institutions, fostering access to credit on a decentralized
level through micro credit, and modernizing financial systems as a whole.
Transport Sector. The program o f reforms and investments in the transport sector in
39.
the 1990s targeted the following: (i)
enhance and sustain efficiency o f the sector’s operation;
(ii)
improve and maintain infrastructure, especially for roads and rail; and (iii)
open access to
the remote and poorest areas. Progress on this reform program to date has been insufficient
and transport costs are extremely high in Mali, accounting for approximately 30% o f product
prices. While railway transport i s the cheapest mode for long distance and bulk traffic, about
80% o f international traffic i s by road due to inefficient railway operations and the poor
condition o f railway track and equipment. Before the crisis in C8te d’Ivoire, between 70 and
80% o f Mali’s trade was transported along the Bamako-Abidjan corridor. The crisis
highlights the importance o f improving alternative transport corridors to Conakry, Lomi,
Cotonou, Dakar, Accra, and Takoradi, in the context o f a regional approach to transport
infrastructure. However, until these alternatives are better developed, the use o f ports further
away than Abidjan has resulted in significant price increases. The railway company’s

-16performance i s expected to improve following the award o f the concession o f railway
services between Dakar and Bamako to a joint venture o f private investors in February 2003.

40.
Energy. The G o M has made important steps on reform and on increasing efficiency
in the energy sector. Until 2001, unreliable power supply was a major constraint for business
expansion in M a l i and tariffs were below economic cost. The state power utility Energie du
Mali (EDM) was poorly managed and lacked finds to ensure quality and reliability o f
services and to expand access to electricity. In 1999, the G o M issued a policy letter with the
following goals: (i)
sector liberalization, allowing initiatives from communities and the
private sector; (ii)institutional reforms to orient the State’s responsibility to activities o f
strategic and regulatory nature; (iii)
valorization o f national energy resources (renewable
energy, hydroelectricity); (iv) protection o f forestry resources through sustainable
exploitation benefiting rural populations; and (v) pursuing petroleum research. The goal is
improved sector efficiency, a withdrawal o f the public sector from operations, and to extend
service coverage. To that end, the G o M has restructured the sector by adopting a new
Electricity L a w and i t s implementation texts, which ends EDM’s monopoly and has opened
the sector to competition, under a regime o f transparent regulation by an independent agency.
Reform processes and institutions need to be strengthened to foster a lasting competitive
business environment attractive to private investors and operators. The imperative to provide
energy services to the poor calls for a spectrum o f energy services, innovative service
delivery mechanisms, with participation by communities, NGOs and the private sector.
41.
Environment. In 1999 with the adoption o f the National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP), the G o M strengthened i t s policy for the environment with seven strategic axes, four
o f which were to strengthen national capacity, restore degraded areas, organize a permanent
system o f control and monitor the environment. However, implementation o f the strategy
has to date been ad hoc and partial. Soil degradation i s the number one environmental issue
in Mali: to improve i t s focus on this issue, the G o M i s currently preparing the National Soil
Fertility Management Plan and has requested Bank support through various operations
including the PASAOP and the proposed Rural Community Based Development Project
(para. 80). As water management i s key to rural development, the National Irrigation
Strategy, elaborated under the National Infrastructure Program (PNIR), concentrates on both
large irrigation schemes as well as pilot actions and operations for small irrigation.
Biodiversity also requires significant attention, although capacity for biodiversity
management i s extremely weak. The G o M i s trying to address this through a Banksupported pilot (the Rural Infrastructure Project) geared to exploring community-based
conservation in an arid area while addressing structural issues at the national level.
42.
Regional Integration. M a l i i s a member o f the Economic Community o f West
African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).
The ECOWAS Heads o f State endorsed the New Partnership for African Development
(NEPAD) and confirmed the role o f the ECOWAS Secretariat as lead agency for
implementation and monitoring. The U E M O A countries signed the “Convergence, Stability,
Growth and Solidarity Pact” (Pacte de Convergence, de Stabilitk, de Croissance e t de
Solidaritk), which commits all member countries to achieve macroeconomic convergence,
and established a multilateral surveillance system. In 2000, the UEMOA’s Customs Union
eliminated all intra-regional tariffs and established the Common External Tariff, which has
created new opportunities and a market that can support medium-size agro-industries in the

- 17region. The ECOWAS Customs Union i s due to be in place by 2007. The U E M O A also
adopted a General Competition Law which sets rules and procedures related to cartels,
abuses o f dominant position within the U E M O A economic space, and state aid to enterprises.
43.
M a l i plays a key role in regional harmonization o f sectoral policies in power,
transport, telecommunications, and agriculture. Potential markets in the region for Mali’s
products include livestock products, fruits (mangoes) and even rice in the medium run. But
success will depend on improvement o f business practices in the region, development o f
market information systems (to be aware o f business opportunities) as well as the elimination
o f non-tariff barriers (including illegal payments at checkpoints) which dramatically slow the
speed and ease o f goods across the region. As a landlocked country lacking a viable
transportation system, whose economy i s based on the primary sector and raw materials, it i s
extremely important that M a l i be well integrated in the western Africa region. The context i s
all the more urgent considering the recent impact o f the CGte d’Ivoire crisis, which clearly
displays the need for further diversification o f trade routes within the region.
In M a y 2002, M a l i signed the Water Charter with Senegal and Mauritania, the other
44.
members o f the Organization for the Development o f the Senegal River (Organisationpour
la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Se‘ne‘gal). This agreement provides a framework for the OMVS
countries to manage the Senegal River Basin more efficiently. Guinea i s expected to j o i n
soon. A similar effort i s also beginning with the Niger River Basin.

111.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAST CAS
A.

Assessment o f Performance

The last CAS was prepared in a context o f strong growth achieved since the 1994
45.
CFA franc devaluation and was based on the 1997 Government strategy - Propositions Pour
Une Croissance Durable et de De‘veloppement 2r 1 ’Horizon 2010. Within this framework, the
Bank’s CAS was structured around two main axes: (i)
stable economic growth; and
(ii)
sustainable human development.
46.
Regarding the first axis - supporting stable economic growth - good progress was
made on growth and macroeconomic stability (see Para. 9) with the support o f the Bank’s
structural adjustment lending and the IMF’s PRGF facility. The Bank also provided support
to broad-based growth by supporting the rural sector through the Grass Roots Hunger and
Poverty Project (PAIB)4 and the Agricultural Services and Farmers Organization Project
(PASAOP), and by expansion o f irrigated areas and building feeder roads through the Rural
Infrastructure Project (PNIR). A Financial Sector Operation was also prepared to support the
goal o f creating an enabling financial environment to allow for private sector-led growth (see
Table 5 for Bank operations approved since the last CAS). The combination o f the SAC,
Financial Sector Project and the Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) program,

The Grassroots Hunger and Poverty project (PAIB) had already surpassed expectations by reaching 186
villages and 172,000 people by the 2002 mid-term review compared to the original end-of-project goals o f
reaching 130 villages and 130,000 people.

- 18together with operations such as the P A I B and PASAOP has proven to be an effective use o f
Bank instruments to support the growth objective.

As regards the second axis - human development - the Bank supported the GoM’s
47.
efforts to improve access to and quality o f social services through: (i)
the Health Sector
Project (PRODESS) which focuses on improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness o f
health delivery systems through cost recovery and further participation by the private sector;
and (ii)
the Basic Education Pilot and Basic Education Project (PRODEC) which target
improving the quality and relevance o f basic education while keeping the costs o f education
and training within affordable levels. The Bank’s support to the health and education sectors
i s contributing to strengtheningfurther the performance o f social sectors indicators which
have shown important improvements since 1998 - as outlined in Tables 3 and 4.

Overall, M a l i has performed well on the implementation o f the CAS. As shown in
48.
Table 6, M a l i fulfilled nearly all o f the triggers in the base case scenario and fulfilled most o f
the triggers in the high case scenario. While M a l i made commendable progress, the
implementation o f the CAS suffered from frequent changes in Government, weak
administrative capacity and unclear institutional roles and structures. Moreover, participation
with stakeholders and partnerships with the private sector, civil society and NGOs were
fledgling so initial delays were encountered in ensuring a more participatory approach to the
implementation o f projects. As a result, there were difficulties encountered in the overall
performance o f the portfolio which meant that the high case trigger for portfolio performance
was not met. The previous CAS period was extended to ensure also that the preparation o f
this CAS was fully aligned with the PRSP.
Client Survey. The April 2002 Client Survey, complemented by a feedback session
49.
in November 2002, concluded the following:

a) the Bank should strengthen its own decentralization and deconcentration process to
be closer to Malian realities. The Bank was already taking, and will continue to take,
concrete actions to strengthenthe skills-base o f the Bamako office. I t i s also taking
advantage o f the availability o f expert staff based in the western Africa region;

b) the Bank needs to help the G o M to strengthen itsJiduciary management in order to
shift to programmatic support. As M a l i moves to a more programmatic approach,

- 19strengthening the analytical base on core fiduciary issues i s a centfal focus o f the
Bank’s work. Moreover, the Bank i s working in close collaboration with other
development partners to ensure that they also move at the same pace towards
programmatic support; and
c) the Bank shouldplay a catalyzing role to increase beneficiary participation and make
them more accountable. In the context o f all operations, the Bank has ensured that
beneficiaries and local partners take o n an increasingly important role in the design
and implementation o f development programs. The success o f the P A I B project
which i s being implementedby local community groups and NGOs i s a good
example o f the effectiveness o f involving beneficiaries. The Bank i s also providing
support through i t s social sector and rural operations to strengthen capacity at local
levels and to ensure a more decentralized service delivery.

B.

Portfolio M a n a g e m e n t

50.
The quality o f the portfolio, which currently includes ten investment projects and one
adjustment project, declined from FY98 to FY02, as evidenced by the rise o f at-risk projects
and overall slow implementation. There i s an issue o f absorptive capacity in Mali, as in
many IDA countries, with the disbursement rate dropping from 20% in FY98-00 to 15% in
FYO1-02. The reasons for these weaknesses stem from: (i)
inadequate institutional
frameworks; (ii)
slow procurement; (iii)
weak financial management; (iv) cumbersome
donor procedures; and (v) poor GoM implementation capacity.
At the start o f FY03, the Bank worked with the G o M to prepare a Portfolio
5 1.
Improvement Program (PIP), which outlined a full action plan to strengthen the performance
o f IDA’Sprojects, and a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) was held in January
2003 (see para. 52 below). Since then, strong corrective actions have been taken and the
three identified problem projects are n o w rated satisfactory. While slow disbursement and
weak management s t i l l hamper some other projects in the portfolio, and the PIP i s being
updated to tackle these issues, the disbursementratio increased to 17.6% in FY03. As o f
July 1,2003, there are t e n projects in the portfolio (see Attachment 5)5, down from fifteen in
FYOl, which will allow efforts to be concentrated on strengthening the performance o f those
projects s t i l l under implementation.

The Improving Learning in Primary Schools LIL Project closed on June 30,2003.

The 2003 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) aimed to build on the PIP,
further pinpoint system blockages and initiate constructive dialogue with GoM, donors, and
civil society partners. The CPPR produced an action plan, validated by G o M in March 2003,
that sets a timeline to solving specific problems within each project and generic problems
affecting many projects such as inadequate institutional framework, weak human resource
capacity, poor monitoring and evaluation and insufficient donor coordination. It was also
recognized that the complex and varying donor procedures were one o f the main causes o f
the slow disbursement and the G o M called on the Bank and other donors to work more
closely together to harmonize their procedures. The Bank agreed with G o M to hold another
CPPR in 2004, when the frequency o f future reviews will be determined (remaining on an
annual basis or reducing the frequency to every eighteen months or two years). The
frequency will depend on: (i)
progress made in resolving issues; and (ii)
whether better
mechanisms have been put in place, such as a necessary G o M portfolio management system,
and a partners’ forum supporting a shift to programmatic and budget support. The Country
Office will continue to reinforce i t s capacity for portfolio management.

With the goal o f addressing institutional development and capacity building, Mali’s
53.
participation in WBI programs has increased significantly over the last two years to reach
470 participants in FY02. Participation will continue to increase further once the Global
Distance Learning Network (GDLN) i s underway and the Distance Learning Center i s built.
A much greater number o f Malian nationals will have access to not only WBI courses, but
also courses offered from other GDLN sites in industrialized and developing countries.
OED Results. OED’s evaluations o f projects closed since FY99 revealed mixed
54.
results for project performance. Out o f the eight projects evaluated during this period, four
were rated satisfactory for outcome while the other four were rated marginally satisfactory.
Only 62.5% were likely to be sustainable. Those not deemed to be sustainable were either
unable to create a viable legal and regulatory framework for sustainability (Mining Capacity
Project), unable to strengthen the framework put in place (Second Power Project), or unable
to ensure long-term financing, (Agricultural Services Project). Fifty percent (4) o f the
projects made substantial institutional impact on institutional development, with one o f those
having a high impact. In three o f the projects with only modest institutional development
impact, sustainability was rated as unlikely. Overall, these ratings highlight the importance
o f preparation, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation in order to effectively build and
strengthen institutional frameworks to sustain viable institutional structures.

million i s concentrated in the gold mining sector, where I F C was active in the 1990s. An
additional gold mining investment was paid o f f in the past year as the mine closed. The
balance o f the portfolio i s a series o f small investments in the hotel industry, including the
Grand Hotel, a second hotel by the same operator, and a small inn; and in the
printing/packaging and construction materials industries. The IFC i s in preliminary

- 22 discussions with Saur Int’l concerning financing for the capital expenditures o f Energie du
Mali, the integrated powedwater utility. The I F C financing i s being developed jointly with
IDA, which backed the privatization. A potential investment o f up to U S $ l O O million by
I F C and other commercial sources i s envisaged. The I F C and the Bank’s energy team have
also played a role in helping Saur and the G o M address disputes concerning the reduction in
tariffs, the associated compensation to be paid to Saur, G o M arrears, and the state o f the
utility upon assumption o f control by Saur.
M a l i i s expected to be one o f the countries to implement an integrated micro, small
57.
and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) support program, implemented by IFC with IDA
support. The program i s currently being finalized and will consist o f establishment o f a
commercial micro-finance bank, capacity building for banks and other lending
intermediaries, Business Development Services to firms, and support to improve the enabling
environment for SMEs. Support from IDA i s under discussion from the proposed Sources o f
Growth Project in FY05, and possibly from the existing Financial Sector Development
Project. IFC and other commercial sources would invest up to US$3 million in the capital o f
the micro-finance bank.

D.

Lessons Learned

58.
A thorough analysis o f the implementation o f the Bank’s previous CAS, including
OED’s evaluations o f closed projects, indicates important lessons which have been taken into
account in the selection and design o f future Bank activities in Mali.

59.

An efficient institutional framework increases sustainability and accelerates
service delivery. Institutional weaknesses, noted for nine active projects (PNIR, PASAOP,
PPIP, Manantali, FSDP, PAAA, PRODESS, PRODEC, and TSP), primarily stem from:
(i)
frequent G o M reshuffles - since 1992, the GoM has changed twelve times; (ii)
poor
donor coordination for meetings and procedures, which leads to multiplicity o f tasks for civil
servants; (iii)
complex procedures, particularly for procurement and disbursement,
complicated by an absence o f motivation and sanction, absence o f follow-up, and weak
human resources; and (iv) insufficient post-project planning from the onset, putting
sustainability at risk.

60.
Trained and motivated human resources are vital. Key structures need to be
continually reinforced: (i)
central administration, particularly in the various ministry offices
o f administration and finance (Directions administratives etfinanci&es), where lack o f
training, motivation, and accountability contributes to slow procurement, poor financial
management, and slow disbursement; (ii)
decentralized and deconcentrated administrative
structures, particularly for the health and education sectors, where personnel i s often lacking
or poorly motivated because o f l o w salaries; and (iii)
civil society and the private sector,
where there are large deficiencies in planning, management, procedures, and monitoring and
evaluation.
6 1.
Decentralization o f service delivery and community-driven development
increase grassroots participation and help adapt development programs to local
realities. By supporting community-driven development, the Bank was able to contribute to
improved service accountability and increased local participation in the preparation and
implementation o f development programs. Aspects o f decentralization were included in

- 23 seven on-going Bank-financed operations from the last CAS (PRODEC, PRODESS, PAAA,
FSDP, PASAOP, PNIR, and PAIB).

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) needs to be conceived from the beginning by
62.
all stakeholders. The 2003 CPPR revealed five active projects (ongoing: PASAOP, PPIP,
PRODESS,PRODEC, and TSP) where insufficient M&E affects program quality. Adequate
M&E resources which include necessary funds for training need to be allocated from the
onset. Stakeholder involvement to determine indicators will better pinpoint not only how to
measure progress, but also the capacity limits o f doing so.

The right combination o f instruments can create good results. A striking element
63.
o f Mali’s economic performance over the last decade i s that remarkable strides have been
made in rural development by an adequate combination o f policy reform, investment,
technology improvements and strong donor coordination. This has been the case for cotton
development, irrigated rice cultivation and, to a lesser extent, micro-finance and integrated
rural development in southern Mali. This lesson has been taken into account and guides the
Bank’s assistance policy by prioritizing the Bank’s ability to mobilize and package structural
adjustment, policy reforms, knowledge and investment around the PRSP.

E.

Partners and Participation

64.
Mali’s economic and political stability, progress o n reform and participatory
traditions, and a large number o f active donors position it well for development partnerships.
Overall, it i s expected that the PRSP will greatly facilitate donor coordination, particularly as
the participatory process o f the PRSP involved all donors and because the PRSP lays out one
comprehensive framework for all donor activities. As part o f the PRSP process, the G o M
holds regular meetings with major donors (Commission mixte), chaired by the Minister o f
Economy and Finance. Donors also meet among themselves on a monthly basis, with the
chair rotating every six months and alternating between bilateral and multilateral partners.
With respect to the UN system, the Bank participates in their monthly coordination meetings;
M a l i i s a Roundtable country and a meeting i s planned for December 2003.
Box 4: Mali’s External Partners
Multilateral
European Unionjust signed their 2003-2006 strategy with the GoM and will be principally involved in budget support
(Mali’s largest donor in this area), the transport sector, and institutional development and decentralization and, to a lesser
extent, supporting the Office du Niger, Malian culture, and civil society.
The United Nations System recently completed i t s 2003-2007 Development Assistance Framework (with participation
from the World Bank). The activities o f the UNDP center around the environment, governance, and education. WHO i s
involved in several health programs. Human development in a broader sense i s supported particularly by UNFPA
(reproductive and women’s rights) and UNICEF (children’s issues). F A 0 and WFP are active in food security, soil and
water conservation (WFP also in education and nutrition). There i s also a UNAIDS country program coordinator.
Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa supports transport and rural development projects, including potable
water and irrigation schemes.
Islamic Development Bank finances the Manantali dam, rural development projects including potable water and irrigation
schemes, and the construction o f health centers.

- 24 -

France supports institutional capacity building and development, including for the judiciary branch, decentralization, health
and education, urban and rural infrastructure, including the Manantali Dam, and the transport sector.
Belgium supports decentralization, health and education, and rural development, mainly in livestock and water (for drinking
and energy). I t also funds various initiatives through trust funds, for example, the FY03 poverty assessment.
Canada i s very active in institutional development, notably in budgets and the judiciary system. I t also supports health and
education, rural infrastructure, including the Manantali Dam and the para-public AGETIPE, urban infrastructure,the
environment and micro finance.
Switzerland intervenes very locally, usually in partnership with large, government programs, in rural development and the
environment, governance and decentralization, supporting artisan industries, and small health programs.
The United States through USAID does not give direct government support, but channels funds through American NGOs
in four areas: health, democracy (large decentralizationand civil society program including capacity building), education,
economic growth, including trade promotion, financial sector development (notably micro finance), and agricultural
promotion (highlighting the animal feed industry).
Germany i s active in supportingthe decentralization process and institutional development, health, education, professional
training, child trafficking, rural development including natural resource management, rural infrastructure, rural finance, and
food security, communications, transport, and mines.
Sweden began intervening in Mali only since 2000, and currently provides budget support with technical assistance and i s
active in education, private sector development in partnership with the IFC/WBG SME department, human rights and
democracy, and i s considering natural resource management through household energy (with participation from the Bank).
Saudi Arabia finances the Manantali Dam and i s involved in transport.
Kuwait also finances the Manantali Dam as well as several irrigation and hydraulic projects.

International NGOs and civil society are crucial partners in development activities in
65.
Mali. C i v i l society i s vibrant with over 1,500 registered international and national NGOs and
as many as 2,500 national associations. Many organizations are well organized into three
confederations, which recently created the National Council o f C i v i l Society Organizations
o f M a l i to better channel civil society dialogue with G o M and the donor community.
Partnerships, more than just participation, are also becoming increasingly important in
development activities. For example, civil society groups and international NGOs
completely manage local capacity building and development projects through the Banksupported Grassroots Hunger and Poverty project (PAIB).
66.
In the context o f i t s project portfolio, the Bank works in partnership with a number o f
major donors in M a l i (see Attachment 5). With regard to the health program, coordination
has improved considerably since the G o M institutedjoint missions and the donor community

- 25 elected a “lead coordinator” (chefde Jile). The education program also benefits from joint
missions although donor coordination i s weaker and i s one o f the main causes for slow
implementation o f the program. Across all the donor-financed programs and projects, the
G o M i s taking action to ensure that joint missions are more comprehensive in their coverage
in order to discourage donors from conducting additional, separate missions. Overall, while
these mechanisms provide a framework for more effective donor coordination, the
multiplicity o f donor procedures impedes efficient project implementation, as noted during
the 2003 CPPR. The Bank i s currently working with other donors on strengthening the
framework for a programmatic approach to the social sectors through pooling resources for
PRDSS and PRODEC. It i s expected that this will avoid the multiplicity o f procedures and
allow the concentration o f capacity building efforts in the programming and implementation
o f these sector-wide programs.

67.
Strengtheningthe programmatic approach to the social sectors i s regarded as a solid
building block for both the donor community and the G o M to move towards full budgetary
support to the implementation o f the PRSP. Most donors, as well as the Bank, have clearly
indicated their intention to provide budgetary support in the near future. It i s important that
donors work together to ensure proper sequencing o f the programmatic approach so that they
are on board at the same time and that ownership i s fully with the GoM. In order to achieve
the objective o f effective budgetary support, two important areas o f capacity building are
to build capacity for the G o M to use i t s own fiduciary and disbursement
essential: (i)
procedures in an efficient and transparent manner; and (ii)
to build capacity for establishing
a comprehensive and effective M&E framework for the PRSP, against which budgetary
support programs can be measured. Building this capacity i s a core element o f donor
programs, including the Bank. While these capacity building efforts are being pursued, the
GoM, donors and the Bank are working in parallel to ensure greater harmonization o f
procedures to the extent possible and are deepening their experience with programmatic
support to the social sector programs.

PROPOSED ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
Strategic Elements o f the FY04-06 CAS

68.
Focus on the PRSP. The PRSP lays out a comprehensive strategy for fighting
poverty and provides a cohesive framework for the activities o f all donors and development
partners. As already described in Paragraph 8, the JSA o f the PRSP highlighted a number o f
areas where the PRSP needs to be improved. The Bank’s CAS focuses on these areas o f
weakness and proposes lending and non-lending activities to assist the G o M to continually
strengthen the implementation o f the PRSP. In particular, the Bank’s AAA work will focus
o n strengthening the growth strategy, linking the sectoral strategies to the PRSP and ensuring
sufficient cross-sectoral linkages with the goal o f developing a more comprehensive
approach to reaching the PRSP indicators and ultimately the MDGs. Progress towards the
objective o f strengtheningthe PRSP will be closely monitored in the context o f the annual
JSAs o f the PRSP Annual Progress Reports.
Selectivity. The Bank’s CAS has been designed to support the implementation o f the
69.
PRSP and to complement the interventions o f other donors, a collaboration aided by Bank

- 26 involvement in the pre aration o f the 2002 United Nations Development Assistance
Framework (UNDAF)! ? . The program selectively focuses on the following themes:
0

0

Promoting growth through combining policy support from the SAC and the Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) with an approach o f increasing agricultural
productivity and diversification through the rural sector operations and through
promoting non-rural sources o f growth which are driven by the private sector (SME
development, mining). The Bank will also invest in transport infrastructure as a
driver o f growth. Finally, the AAA program has been structured towards a greater
understanding o f the sources o f growth and the necessary legal and incentive
frameworks to maximize the potential sources o f growth. This theme covers the
PRSP Pre-Requisite Growth Pillar and PRSP Pillar 3: Develop Basic Infrastructure
and Productive Sectors.
Developing Human Resources. The focus i s on working with donors to strengthen
the programmatic approach in the health and education sector wide programs
(SWAPS), with the goal o f moving to full budgetary support via the PRSCs.
Furthermore, the participatory process o f preparing the CAS (see B o x 5) revealed that
stakeholders in M a l i would like to see the Bank’s strategy incorporate the following:
(i)
the evolving role o f the State, particularly to allow for beneficiaries to be fully
involved in all stages o f projects and programs; (ii)
strengthening governance to
ensure that projects and programs - particularly those for the social sectors are more
participatory and transparent; and (iii)
capacity building. The CAS emphasizes the
participation o f all development partners in Bank activities and proposes that capacity
building for stakeholders be streamlined into the planning and implementation o f
policies and programs. This theme covers PRSP Pillar 2: Develop Human Resources
and Improve Access to Services.

Public finance management and governance. The Bank’s program focuses on the
public sector financial accountability mechanisms covering public expenditure,
procurement, and financial management systems. The fiduciary analysis will cover
the country’s policies and priorities and will continuously identify action plans to
address remaining weaknesses. The fiduciary cross-cutting issues are crucial to the
on-going Bank programs, the planned operations, as well as the preparation for the
PRSCs. With regard to strengthening governance, the Bank will focus on assisting
the G o M to implement the recommendations o f the Anti-Corruption Program and on
providing support to decentralization. This theme i s integral to PRSP Pillar 1:
Promote Institutional Development, Improve Governance and Participation.

To contribute to the harmonizationo f donor support o f the PRSP and to help Mali achieve the MDGs, the UN system o f
donors, including the Bank, prepared the 2003-2007 UNDAF.

- 27 Box 5: C A S PreDaration: A Consultative Process
Consultative actions led in 2002-3:

Mopti Retreat, May 31- June 4, 2002. Over sixty participants - representing the State, collectivities, civil society,
private sector, and donors - brainstormed on CAS possibilities, basing their reflections on the PRSP, the MDGs,
and field visits to Bank-financedprojects.
Rural Development Strategy Discussions, October 29-31, 2002. Bank staff, primarily from the RD sector, held
internal discussions for two days, then invited counterparts to join them in a discussion o f the Bank’s work, past &
future, to support rural development in Mali.
Clieni Survey Feedback Workshop, November 5, 2002. Over forty-five participants (representing the State,
collectivities, civil society, private sector, and donors) provided pragmatic suggestions to improving the Bank’s
service delivery and enhancing its programmingduring the next CAS period.
Country Portfolio Performance Review, January 7-10,2003. Led by the Minister of Economy and Finance, and
after months of preparation, more than one hundred participants representing the State, collectivities, civil society,
private sector, and donors reviewed the Bank’s portfolio for the first time since 1995 and proposed concrete
immediate and medium-term actions to improve its quality and performance.
Regional consultations in SPgou, Mopti, and Timbuktu, February 15, 22, and 24, 2003. Bringing together local
development actors and representatives from key central structures, the sessions focused on pinpointing blockages
to the decentralizationand deconcentration process, and the implications for Bank operations in Mali.
Bamako Consultation, March 20, 2003. This workshop allowed over seventy participants to debate the contents
of the CAS before it was finalized.
Gender Focus, At all stages o f the consultative process, women were actively consulted and involved and
gender-sensitive issues were frequently raised during the discussions.

70.
The overall direction o f the CAS i s to move away from structural adjustment
operations and stand-alone investment operations in the social sectors and to move towards
multi-sectoral, budget support operations in those areas. At the same time, the Bank will
continue to focus i t s strengths in supporting rural development and promoting sources o f
growth. While it i s active in urban and transport activities, it i s important to emphasize that
the Bank i s not the lead donor in these sectors but rather provides complementary financing
to that o f other donors.
Bank Lending Instruments. The Bank’s support to M a l i will continue to be through
71,
a selection o f lending instruments, combining support from structural adjustment or PRSC
lending with community-driven operations and specific investment operations:

a) support through Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC), moving to Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) in the third year o f the CAS implementation.
The Bank’s positive experience with structural adjustment in M a l i has shown that
policy-based lending i s an effective mechanism o f support. Future support will
continue to focus on macroeconomic issues, public sector management (including
decentralization) and reforms in the cotton sector. As the overall fiduciary
framework i s strengthenedand donor coordination enhanced, the Bank would
move to further programmatic support to the PRSP through PRSC lending in
FY06 (in the high case, the PRSCs could be introduced in FY05). The core
diagnostic work for programmatic lending - such as the CFAA, CPAR, CEM,
Poverty Assessment and PER - will all be in place by the time the PRSCs are

- 28 introduced and this would under-pinthe programmatic transition. In the future,
PRSCs are expected to account for about 30% o f the annual IDA allocation.

b) community-driven development operations which focus on raising the
productivity o f labor and capital through supporting the productive sectors and
fighting HIV/AIDS. These operations will draw from the successful experience
to date with the IDA-financed Grassroots Hunger and Poverty Project (PAIB);
and
c) the Bank will continue its support through traditional investment operations
concentrating on specific needs in the transport sector and in private sector
development with the goal o f enhancing the competitiveness o f Mali’s economy.
The Bank will continue to ensure that these investment operations are developed
as part o f a comprehensive sectoral framework and in close partnership with other
donors.

72.
Monitoring and Evaluation. To assess CAS performance, the Bank will monitor the
CAS support to the PRSP using PRSP indicators (see Table 10 and the CAS Matrix in Annex
B9). The Bank will closely monitor portfolio performance indicators for all IDA-financed
operations in order to evaluate the effectiveness o f specific operations in achieving desired
outcomes. In addition, the Bank will have regular consultations with the GoM, civil society
and the donor community to get feedback and monitor implementation o f CAS priorities.
The CAS will also monitor progress on key MDG targets as indicated in Attachment 1. The
quality o f Mali’s statistical system will be a key factor in the success o f the monitoring and
evaluation effort and capacity building for M&E will be a priority. In particular, the Bank
and other donors will assist the G o M to: (i)
rationalize the selection o f monitoring indicators
enhance feedback loops to ensure that the
to ensure their utility as management tools; (ii)
monitoring and results indicators are used in planning and policy formulation processes; and
(iii)
support the involvement o f civil society in the M&E o f the PRSP.

B.

Assistance Program

CAS Theme: Promoting Growth
PRSP Pre-RequisitePillar: Accelerated and Re-Distributive Growth
PRSP Pillar 3: Develop Basic Infrastructure and Productive Sectors

As highlighted in the JSA, the key challenge in the medium (and long) term remains
73.
how to broaden the economic base and strengthen growth so that the country i s in a better
position to withstand the impact o f adverse climatic conditions and external shocks. The
Bank’s strategy will focus o n helping M a l i to: (i)
develop and diversify sources o f growth
through improving the financial and business environment for increased private sector
development, including for micro, small, and medium enterprises (with involvement fi-om the
Bank-IFC SME department); (ii)
build and maintain necessary infi-astructure; and
(iii)
involve decentralized government, deconcentrated services and local populations while
building capacity.

- 29 74.
One o f the areas o f weakness noted in the PRSP i s that there i s very little mention o f
exactly h o w the proposed PRSP investments will contribute to the sought-after growth rate,
largely because M a l i has not yet formulated a coherent and integrated growth strategy. For
this reason, the FY04 CEM will focus on the growth prospects and will articulate an
integrated pro-poor growth strategy. It i s expected that the sources o f growth will be from
diversification o f the agricultural base into fruits, vegetables and Arabic gum, development
o f agri-business and transformation o f agricultural products (i.e. textiles), expansion o f
mining, development o f the tourism and handicrafts industries and promotion o f small and
medium-sized enterprises in services, communications and other non-agricultural sectors.
The Integrated Framework for Trade for M a l i (IF) (under preparation), an initiative
supported by the World Bank, IMF, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, and the International Trade
Commission, seeks to enhance Mali’s integration into the world economy and intemational
trade policy discussions. The trade diagnostic study will highlight Mali’s comparative
advantages and formulate an action plan for capacity building and technical assistance to
promote export-led growth, centered around selected agri-industries and some traditional
knowledge industries (namely music, handicrafts and tourism). The IF report will be
discussed at the next UN Round Table for Trade - tentatively scheduled for December 2003.
75.
The findings o f the IF and C E M diagnostics will provide essential inputs to the design
o f the multi-sectoral Sources o f Growth Project (FY05). While it i s too early to pre-judge
the recommendations o f the IF and CEM, it i s expected that the Sources o f Growth Project
will focus on three components: (i)
support to further legal and regulatory reforms to create a
more conducive environment for private sector development, with particular emphasis on the
communications sector; (ii)
the implementation o f an innovative SME Department initiative
in micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) development involving improving access to
capital and building knowledge. This would be complementary to the ongoing Financial
Sector Project; and (iii)
development o f the mining sector since, while gold became the
largest export eamer for M a l i in 2002, it does not contribute as much as it might to the
economy’s development7. The project will also ensure complementarity with the rural sector
operations which focus o n diversifying the agriculture base and developing agri-businesses.
To ensure selective and adequate coverage o f the rural sector in the CAS, the Bank
76.
conducted extensive analytical work which identified eight key issues and challenges to rural
development in Mali: uneven productivity, poor infrastructure, perpetuation o f barriers to
decentralization, unfavorable business climate for private sector, limited diversification o f
income, weak export competitiveness and unfinishedprivatizations, an inadequate risk
management strategy, natural resources constraints and capital depletion. The key
conclusion o f this analysis i s that poverty i s synonymous to subsistence agriculture.
Therefore, a key priority i s to allow farmers to get access to markets, generate cash income,
increase productivity through input, equipment and technology and get out o f the vicious
circle o f subsistence agriculture, l o w productivity and poverty.

’

The mining component will seek to respond to three key GoM concerns: (i) to ensure that Mali offers the optimal package
to both attract incoming investors and increase revenues to the budget and the economy; (ii) to strengthen its capacity to

track and analyze what mining companies are doing, both in general operations and with respect to environmental concerns;
and (iii)to help artisanal and small-scale miners to operate in a more efficient and environmentally friendlier manner. The
Bank has a comparative advantage in this area as a result of significant recent mining work in other countries.

- 30 The fact that poverty i s predominantly rural points to the need that growth must come
77.
from rural areas to increase rural incomes and provide employment (farm and non-farm).
The sources o f growth in the rural sector are quite well known and the Bank has experience
and knowledge o f what kind o f investments can stimulate rural growth. The question i s more
to formulate comprehensive programs, facilitate G o M commitment and mobilize the
resources, particularly human, for implementation. For example, the livestock sector i s
potentially important for growth and poverty reduction in view o f i t s role in the rural
economy. The same applies for nontraditional exports (fruits and vegetables, arabic gum,
Tiger pea, etc.), for which markets exist and pilot marketing tests have been successful (e.g.
mango exports by sea). The actions to be undertaken to support development o f these subsectors need to be articulated in a clear and operational strategy fully backed by G o M and
stakeholders. The Bank plans to do this in the context o f the CEM as well as through the
rural operations.
The Agriculture Diversification and Competitiveness Program (FY05) aims to
78.
build o n the knowledge base and raise rural population incomes through promoting high
value-added agriculture products, raising agricultural productivity, increasing market access,
upgrading irrigation equipment and techniques and improving cotton sector production. The
program will be intrinsically linked to the on-going cotton reforms being pursued through the
SAC. The objectives o f this project respond to the pressing needs for income generation,
diversification and food security. The project will complement the on-going two rural
development projects, namely the National Program for Rural Infrastructure (PNIR) and
the Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Support Program (PASAOP)
which focus respectively on rural infrastructure and environmental protection and
agricultural research and support to agricultural and producer organizations.
As outlined in B o x 3, the Bank has been very active in helping the G o M and
79.
stakeholders in the cotton sector to respond to the severe crisis o f C M D T in 1999/2000, as
well as to prepare and implement a sector restructuring program which i s being supported
through SAC-3. These reforms have been initiated and the transition to a fully privatized and
liberalized sector organization will require strong and steady support for a number o f years.
Given Mali’s comparative advantage in the cotton sector, recovery o f the sector remains a
high priority and the Bank’s program will continue to provide close assistance to the
country’s efforts in this regard.
As already mentioned, Mali’s population i s predominately rural and dependent o n the
80.
agriculture sector. While basic infrastructure i s essential and i s being supported through the
PNIR, it alone will not catalyze rural development; rural populations also need sustainable
revenue-generating activities. The proposed Rural Community-BasedDevelopment
Project (RCBD - FY05) aims to create alternatives to rapid city migration by creating rural
j o b opportunities using a participatory approach and by promoting social and productive
investments. The operation will also focus on capacity building for local government,
deconcentrated service providers and local populations, including civil society. I t will build
on the community-driven development lessons from the successful Grassroots Hunger and
Poverty Project (PAIB) and will complement the activities o f the PNIR.

The current Urban Development and Decentralizationproject will be extended to
81.
allow for full implementation. As the urban population continues to grow, the Bank will
conduct Urban Analysis ESW to take into account rural-urban migration issues and to

-31 determine the priority issues facing urban areas. The results o f this study will enable a sound
design o f a follow-on operation (preparation in FY06) which would focus on secondary
cities, including the capitals o f each region and on strengthening the capacities o f the
municipalities and other decentralized entities to manage resources and development
programs.

A Household Energy and Universal Access Project (FY04) will be jointly financed
82.
by GEF, IDA and UNDP. In addition to helping G o M focus on strategy, policy, and
monitoring and evaluation, the household energy component will help transfer the
management o f forest resources to local communities by promoting community-based forest
management initiatives, including the introduction and the promotion o f efficient charcoal
production technologies. It will also empower local communities, NGOs and the private
sector to operate demand-side inter-fuel substitution initiatives such as the manufacturing,
commercialization and dissemination o f improved (wood, charcoal) stoves as well as
kerosene and L P G stoves. Due to the vast expanse o f Mali, and the l o w density o f
population in many regions, it will not be viable to connect the entire country to the grid;
thus many areas will depend on appropriate rural electrification schemes. The project takes
into account transversal aspects such as solar power for rural health clinics and schools, as
well as for agro-industrial transformation. The Netherlands are currently financing an
interim Household Energy project. This project will be implemented in parallel to the
Western Africa Power Project (WAPP, currently under preparation) which aims to build
and reinforce regional electricity transmission lines (see B o x 6 for further details o f regional
activities). M a l i will be the beneficiary for about US$70 million o f this US$250 million
credit, for i t s 54 1 kilometer share o f the transmission line linking Segou in M a l i to
Ferkkssedougou in C6te d’Ivoire.
In a landlocked country as large as Mali, the transport sector i s critical to improve
83.
access both to and within the country. While the European Commission i s the lead donor in
financial terms for road investments (about EUR140 million over the next four years), there
i s s t i l l a need for Bank involvement, in particular regarding the policy framework and to help
ensure a coherent sector-wide approach. In this respect, the Bank i s working very closely
with the EU on the preparation o f an I n t e r i m Transport Project which i s near completion
(early FY04), focusing on: (i)
redundancies for R C F M (railway) staff to increase the
efficiency o f the firm as it i s concessioned; (ii)
the rehabilitation o f two major roads; and
(iii)
mitigating the adverse effects on road quality as a result o f the C6te d’Ivoire crisis. This
project will be an integral part o f the Bank’s regional efforts to develop and improve the
transport corridors in western Africa. A planned Transport Sector and G r o w t h E S W
(FY04) will focus on the linkages between transport and other sectors and will provide
support to the agenda o f growth with equity which will be pursued under the Second
Transport Sector P r o g r a m (FY06). This program will be designed in close collaboration
with several other donors - EU, France, AfDB, IsDB, Kuwaiti Fund and the Saudi Fund.
The Bank financing will be complementary to that provided by these partners.

Three Global Environment Facility (GEF) operations will be launched in M a l i over
84.
the next three years. The Biodiversity Project (FY04) aims to halt and, in some cases,
reverse biodiversity degradation trends in key conservation areas and project sites; this
project i s being prepared and implemented in partnership with France (French GEF). Two

- 32 large multilateral efforts to improve resource management along the Senegal and N i g e r
R i v e r Basins should come to fruition in F Y 0 4 and F Y 0 6 respectively.
Box 6: Bank Activities on Regional Integration

As already mentioned in Paragraphs 42-44, Mali i s a member of UEMOA and ECOWAS and plays a key
role in several regional integration activities. The Bank’s 2001 Regional Integration Assistance Strategy
(RIAS) seeks to support the objective o f deeper regional integration chosen by the countries o f WAEMU
and ECOWAS by promoting an Open, Unified Regional Economic Space (OURES), and a conducive
environment to facilitate the growth o f a more efficient and competitive private sector. I t also seeks to
support the Region’s own goals o f accelerating growth and alleviating poverty, while recognizing that
assistance to individualcountries - with a heightened focus on cross-border constraints and opportunities
facing a country - will remain the primary vehicle for support from the Bank.
The following regional activities all play a core role in the Bank’s overall support to Mali:
The West African Power Project (WAPP) aims to build and reinforce regional electricitytransmission
lines through financing a line between CBte d’Ivoire and Mali and to assist in developing the regulatory
framework for regional power trade within ECOWAS (see para. 82).
The harmonization o f telecommunications policy and the establishment o f a regional regulatory
framework i s likely to feature as a component o f the Sources o f Growth Project (FY05).
The Bank i s providing support to regional water management issues through AAA work and a regional
IDF to the Organization for the Development o f the Senegal River (OMVS).
The proposed transport operations are being designed within an overall regional framework for
strengthening and diversifying the transport corridors in western Africa.
The Bank’s AAA will focus on fast-tracking integration between Mali, Senegal and Guinea
A Regional Payments System Credit to the BCEAO i s under implementation that seeks to establish
payment systems adapted to the market needs o f WAEMU and that are internationally acceptable.
Support to the implementation o f the WAEMU Agricultural Policy (adopted in December 2001).
0 A proposed Institutional and Financial Development Project for the West African Development Bank
(BOAD) which would promote the development o f integrated financial marketing in western Africa.

C A S Theme: Developing Human Resources
P R S P Pillar 2: Develop Human Resources and I m p r o v e Access to Quality Basic
Services

The Bank proposes to focus on: (i)
solidifying the necessary framework for
85.
sustainable human development; (ii)
increasing participation and local accountability in
deconcentrated service delivery; (iii)
improving access to quality services; (iv) working
more closely with donors to build capacity o f G o M and other development actors; and
(v) working with NGOs, the private sector, community groups and civic organizations to
reduce the risk o f an HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The Bank will work with the donor community to seek to transform the ongoing
86.
education sector operation P I S E into a fully pooled SWAP during the transition to budget
support. At present, many donors finance the PISE; while the European Union, the
Netherlands and Sweden finance through budget support, other donors are s t i l l earmarking
funds to be used for specific sub-programs. As previously mentioned, the problems related
to the multiplicity o f donor procedures and allocation criteria are a major cause o f the slow

- 33 disbursements. If necessary, the closing date o f this project may be extended by one year. In
FY05, the Bank will undertake Education Sector Strategy ESW in education to help define
the focus o f the second phase o f PRODEC, the ten-year education program, and to strengthen
the MTEF for education to feed into the PRSCs in FY06. Furthermore, M a l i i s a candidate
for the Education for All initiative, which should significantly increase funding to the
education sector in order to accelerate the rise in enrollment rates while improving education
quality.

87.
The first phase o f PDDSS, Mali’s ten-year health and social development program,
ends in December 2003 and the Bank’s PRODESS support operation i s due to close by mid2004. The Bank will consider extending the closing date to finance the early part o f
designing the second phase. A Health Sector Issues ESW will be carried out in FY05 to
provide technical support to the second phase o f PDDSS and to feed into the preparation o f
the PRSCs. It i s expected that subsequent support to the health sector will come through
PRSCs, to help reduce the current high transaction costs due to the multiplicity o f donor
procedures.

The 2001 Adult HIV prevalence rate was estimated at 1.7%; however, the significant
88.
population movements due to the crisis in neighboring Ivory Coast (where the HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate i s 9.65%) pose a potentially serious threat to Mali. The proposed Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project (FY04), to be funded through an IDA grant, will, inter alia,
support community efforts on fighting HIV/AIDS through capacity building, establish an
information-education-communication (IEC) mechanism, and create partnerships particularly
with the transport and private sectors to fight the disease. The project will complement other
ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives such as the work o f UNAIDS and activities under
the HIV/AIDS component o f the PDDSS. It will also focus specifically on the gender
dimensions o f HIV infection as the infection rate for women i s higher than for men.

CAS Theme: Public Finance Management and Governance
PRSP Pillar 1: Promote InstitutionalDevelopment While Improving Governance and
Participation.
Given Mali’s satisfactory maintenance o f macroeconomic stability and i t s recent
89.
completion o f the PRSP, the G o M has indicated that it would eventually like to benefit from
budget support for the implementation o f the PRSP. As already outlined in Paragraph 7 1, the
Bank proposes a gradual move towards the introduction o f PRSCs in FY06. As it moves to
PRSCs, the Bank’s assistance will focus on carrying out the core diagnostic reports (as
shown in Table 7), and strengthening public sector management and governance, which were
highlighted in the JSA as particular concerns.

90.
Given the negative impact o f the C6te d’Ivoire crisis on the Malian economy, the
G o M would need additional assistance in calendar year 2003 to support the implementation
o f the PRSP program: the Bank i s planning to provide assistance through a supplemental
credit to the on-going SAC-3, provided that the G o M has outlined appropriate actions to take
to respond to the situation. As the Bank moves to introduce PRSCs by FY06, it will continue
to provide balance o f payments support through a fourth Structural Adjustment Credit

- 34 (SAC-4, in FY04), which will support continued public expenditure management reforms,
budget management reforms and initiate support to decentralization reforms (thus also
supporting Pillar 2 o f the PRSP), as well as cotton sector reforms (thus supporting Pillar 3 o f
the PRSP). With respect to decentralization, the focus o f the Bank’s work will involve
strengthening central and deconcentrated levels o f GoM, as well as the elected
representatives o f municipalities, districts, and regions to: (i)
assess, focus, and reinforce
their structures; (ii)
improve accountability, control o f public finances, efficient and
transparent resource allocation, and overall good governance in public management; and
(iii)
better integrate public participation.

The Bank’s AAA program will concentrate o n the following: (i)
assisting the G o M
91.
implement the recommendations o f the 2003 C F A A which i s being completed in partnership
with the Netherlands and Canada; (ii)
continuing to work closely with the IMF o n
implementingthe action plan o f the HIPC Expenditure Tracking Assessment; (iii)
updating
the 1998 CPAR and ensuring implementation o f the recommendations; (iv) continuing the
close dialogue with the G o M on the implementation o f the recommendations o f the AntiCorruption Program; and (v) analyzing further necessary policy and structural reforms
through the C E M planned for FY04.

M a l i conducts i t s own Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), under an agreement
including ex-post review by the Bank and the IMF. To further strengthen the GoM’s
capacity to prepare PERs, the Bank will provide close analytical and technical assistance
throughout FY04 in a framework o f dialogue with other donors. The Bank will also continue
support to the development o f sectoral medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF). The
last Poverty Assessment was undertaken in 1993; while the work undertaken for the PRSP
provided an adequate poverty diagnosis, based on an indicator o f access to basic social
services, there was very l i t t l e data available at the time to allow full discussion o f the
dimensions o f poverty (this was indicated in the JSA as a weakness o f the PRSP). Through a
Belgian trust fund, a full poverty assessment i s being undertaken in order to better understand
the determinants and dynamics o f poverty, as well as the impact o f G o M policies and actions
on poverty. In FY06, the Bank will again update the analysis o f poverty which will, inter
alia, allow for a comprehensive assessment o f poverty trends since the 2003 analysis.

- 35 The poverty assessment will also provide a rich basis for the preparation o f the FY05
93.
Gender Assessment which will deepen and broaden the Bank's work in addressing gender
issues and will feed into the PRSP through facilitating a more gender-responsive agenda.
Gender i s a crosscutting priority in the PRSP and the Bank will be supporting several nonlending operations to support gender issues. In conjunction with the Japan Social
Development Fund (JDSF), the Bank will support the capacity building o f communitybased legal aid NGOs that target vulnerable groups (widows and orphans living with
HIV/AIDS; victims o f harmful traditional practices). Further support to gender issues will
be contributed through an FY04 IDF grant for InstitutionalSupport to the Ministry o f
Women, Children and Family.
The planned Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) work in the cotton sector
94.
will evaluate the impact o f the cotton sector recovery program on rural poverty and propose
policy recommendations to increase the impact o f cotton growth o n poverty reduction. This
analysis i s expected to yield qualitative as well as quantitative results which will feed into the
consultations regarding the next phase o f the reform program and help fine-tune
implementation o f the program. A PSIA on macro-growth policies i s also proposed to be
carried out in conjunction with the CEM.
The JSA highlightedthe lack o f a clear mechanism for Monitoring and Evaluation (M
95.
& E) o f the PRSP as well as a complete l i s t o f quantified results-oriented indicators. The
Bank works closely with the G o M and other development partners to strengthen the M&E
framework and ensure a more results-based focus. The Bank's PER, MTEF and AAA
support to statistical services will contribute to this goal. With respect to participation, the
JSA highlightedthe need to institutionalize participatory mechanisms that involve
stakeholders in the implementation and M&E o f programs. Consequently, stakeholders and
beneficiaries will be increasingly involved in determining indicators and measuring progress.
A range o f Observatories (poverty, labor, social affairs, etc.) i s providing analyses and
thematic studies on their sectors' status, the impact o f sectoral policies and makes policy
recommendations. These institutions play a key role in dissemination o f information. The
GoM, with the support o f the Bank and donors, i s strengthening the dissemination aspect o f
the M&E system through putting the focus on the establishment o f web-based networks o f
interrelated databases to be developed progressively while, at the same time, strengthening o f
the communication system at the regional and community level.
The Bank will continue to provide support to developing M & E systems through a
96.
under the GRIP project, support i s being provided to the
variety o f instruments: (i)
Sustainable Human Development Observatory (Observatoire du de'veloppement humain
durable - ODHD) and to the National Department o f Statistics (Direction Nationale de la
Statistique et de 1 'Informatique - DNSI) to improve decision making in poverty alleviation
and to carry out the population census and a household survey. The O D H D i s operational and
i s being supported also by UNDP; and (ii)
under the proposed CBRD project, support will
be extended to the DNSI to enable them to carry out household surveys, monitor the
evolution o f poverty in rural areas, evaluate the impact o f projects on poverty reduction, and
help those projects better target poverty stricken communities and areas. The CBRD project
will also continue the support provided under the Natural Resources Management project
(now closed) to continue strengthening the Environmental Information Systems (EIS) and
build capacity in several national agencies which are charged with environmental monitoring.

- 36 M a l i i s currently preparing a Statistical Master Plan with the assistance of another
97.
World Bank facility the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, TF-SCB. The TFSCB i s a grant which supports a three-year strengtheningprogram for the statistical system.
It will help the country review and update the national strategy for the development o f the
statistical system prepared since 2001 as the “Schema Directeur de la Statistique” and format
it as a Statistical Master Plan (SMP). Once the Master Plan i s adopted by the Government, a
STATCAP program could be prepared for a ten-year period to support the cost o f recurrent
statistical activities (National accounting, Price Index, Social Accounting Matrix, Statistical
Yearbooks, etc.) as well as survey programs.
98.
The Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) i s a transversal public-private,
institutional and civil society capacity building operation planned for FY04. Distance
learning will bring quality educational and training programs to a much wider audience in
M a l i than would otherwise be possible. I t i s also expected that M a l i would benefit from a
grant proposed to help launch a portal in the Development Gateway during the CAS period.
C.

Lending Scenarios

The IDA FY04-06 allocation for M a l i i s set at US$390 million in the base-case
99.
scenario, US$462 million in the high-case scenario and US$237 million in the low-case
scenario (Table 8). The planned operations for M a l i are relatively large (with the exception
o f the GDLN project) so as to allow for consolidation o f the project portfolio around fewer
operations. These projects are, to the extent possible, multi-sectoral operations and involve
partnerships with donors, NGOs, the private sector and civil society. There i s a degree o f
front-loading o f the lending operations primarily because planned FY03 operations were
pushed to FY04 as their preparation suffered delays resulting from the 2002 Presidential and
legislative elections and the formation o f a new Government.
100. Base-case scenario. M a l i i s currently in the base case. Under the base-case scenario,
lending for M a l i will amount to up to US$390 million. This scenario i s predicated o n
continued good macroeconomic performance, satisfactory implementation o f the PRSP,
transparency and accountability in public finance management, and portfolio management
(Table 9). Strengthening the performance o f Bank operations will be a central element o f the
Bank’s assistance to Mali, with a core focus on continued implementation o f the actions
outlined in the PIP and highlighted by the CPPR. Delays in implementing the PRSP and
difficulties in carrying out public finance management and governance measures could
prevent M a l i from achieving the high case triggers. However, sustained and better
coordinated support on these issues from donors and the Bank should help M a l i to address
these challenges.

101. High-case scenario. Lending could increase to up to US$462 million under the highcase scenario, with the PRSCs introduced in FY05 ($35 million) and the allocation to the
Second Transport Project increased to $90 million. This scenario i s predicated on
accelerated progress on the four criteria outlined in Table 9. There i s a good possibility that
M a l i could meet the triggers for the high case due to the following factors: (i)
it has a strong
track record in implementing macroeconomic and structural reforms, and this good
performance i s expected to be maintained; (ii)
the G o M and development partners are fully
committed to the PRSP and i t s reform program and the PRSP provides a more
comprehensive framework for G o M activities and donor interventions; and (iii)
progress on
key sectors - such as health and education - has been strong since 1998, thus providing a

- 38 solid platform for continued good performance and achievement o f PRSP targets, particularly
with a more programmatic support from donors.

102. Low-case scenario. The low-case scenario i s determined on M a l i not being able to
meet the base-case criteria. In this case, lending would only be up to US$237 million as the
Bank would not do any further adjustment lending and would reduce or delay other lending
operations. The PRSCs would be postponed until FY07 (or beyond). If necessary, an
investment operation would be prepared to support the health and education sectors, in the
absence o f budgetary support from the PRSC. The focus o f the Bank’s work would shift to
supporting capacity building to enable M a l i to move back to the base case.

103. Use o f I D A Grants. M a l i qualifies for IDA grants as a debt-vulnerable IDA-only
country as per the guidelines which set the criteria as part o f the IDA-13 replenishment
framework. On this basis, IDA grants can account for 29% o f the lending program although
the actual percentage o f the lending program which may be financed by IDA grants i s
established on an annual basis. The strategy for the use o f these grants in the M a l i program
i s to apply them to those Bank activities which support the priorities o f the PRSP. In FY04,
the Global Distance Learning Network Project, the proposed HIV/AIDS MAP operation, and
the proposed SAC-3 Supplemental Credit would be financed through IDA grants. The
Interim Transport Project in FY04 and the Rural Community-BasedProject in FY05 would
be partially funded through IDA grants.

RISKS & RISK MITIGATION

104. M a l i enjoys relative stability, both in political terms and in terms o f macroeconomic
management, thus considerably reducing overall risk. However, there are both exogenous
and internal risks to Mali’s development and the successful implementation o f the FY04-06
CAS, which the Bank’s program proposes to mitigate. The PRSP appropriately signaled the
following four major exogenous risks that could compromise the achievement o f
development and poverty reduction objectives, and thus also CAS objectives.
105. Natural risks (drought and pest infestation, etc.), which influence agricultural output.
T o mitigate these risks, the emphasis in the PRSP i s on further developing Mali’s largely
untapped hydrological potential and o n ensuring food security i s primarily intended to
address this vulnerability. The Bank’s program supports this goal through the several
agricultural and rural infrastructure operations either already under implementation or
proposed.
106. The volatility o f commodity prices (mainly cotton and gold). Mali’s vulnerability to
volatile commodity prices stems from the lack o f diversity in i t s agricultural production and
product transformation. The Bank’s program i s focused around developing sources o f
growth and diversifying the economy. Moreover, the Bank’s continued support to the cotton
sector through the SAC-3 i s strengthening further the competitiveness o f the sector. The
CAS also mitigates the economic risk through promoting stable macroeconomic policies and
ensuring sufficient structural adjustment assistance to respond to the negative impacts.
Finally, the availability o f IDA grant financing in IDA-13 will also contribute to ensuring
that Mali’s debt levels remain sustainable.

107. Uncertain external assistance, which i s especially important for the strategy’s
success, given the ambitious government revenue projections and growth rate. This risk can
best be mitigated by M a l i demonstrating that it i s increasing i t s absorptive capacity and
improving the efficiency o f public expenditure management. The thrust o f the CAS with

- 40 respect to portfolio management and strengtheningthe fiduciary framework i s designed inter
alia to help M a l i make a tenable case for sustained and, if possible, increased external
support. This risk i s also being mitigated by strengthening donor coordination so that various
partners are ready to help cover any unforeseen resource gaps that may emerge.
108. Continued negative impacts o f the C6te d’Ivoire crisis. The impact o f the crisis on
GoM’s revenues can be mitigated through the proposed supplemental lending o f the SAC-3.
The impact on the f l o w o f exports and imports due t o transport bottlenecks and higher costs
will be mitigated through the proposed transport sector operations which will help M a l i to
strengthen other corridors for trade and reduce the cost o f using them. Finally, the Bank i s
working closely o n regional integration issues in West Africa which will promote a more
integrated approach in the region to transport and infrastructure.

109. Finally, as regards internal risks, the main risk i s posed by the weak institutional
capacity and governance in Mali, particularly on the decentralized and deconcentrated levels.
The risk o f not been able to sustain a serious legal and judicial reform effort would also
endanger the economic development goals and weaken the democratization effort. Several
donors are already working with GoM to build capacity on decentralized/deconcentrated
levels. These efforts will be reinforced through close follow up on the recommendations o f
the CFAA, CPAR and the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Report in order to ensure that financial
mechanisms and institutional structures in place truly respond to needs. The risk o f slowerthan required program implementation owing to capacity constraints will be reduced through
continued technical support by the World Bank and other donors to build capacity through
the PRSP process.
VI.

MEASURING RESULTS

110. The CAS focuses o n defining and measuring results in the framework o f the overall
monitoring and evaluation o f the PRSP. Table 10 outlines the CAS measurable indicators
which include the PRSP targets for 2006 which focus o n making progress towards the
MDGs. In the context o f the annual PRSP Progress Reports and related JSAs, as well as
through continuous monitoring o f the project portfolio, the Bank will assess the achievement
o f the CAS on meeting the PRSP goals.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

111. Mali's PRSP, together with i t s good track record o n economic management and
structural reforms, have laid a solid foundation for the Bank's CAS. I t i s expected that Mali's
commitment to the objectives o f the PRSP and i t s strong partnership with the World Bank
will result in satisfactory implementation o f the PRSP and the CAS. The Bank i s committed
to working closely with the Malian authorities and all development partners to reach this
goal.

The method included reforming the irrigation agency (Office du Niger or ON), rehabilitation and
modernization o f irrigation canaldstructures, and agricultural policy reforms (rice price/market
liberalization and land tenure). The project also sought to: (i)strengthen and narrow 0 ” s focus on
infrastructure management and agricultural services by divesting i t s commercial activities and by
making i t s operations more transparent; (ii)forge stronger partnerships between ON, GoM and
farmers through performance contracts, training and improved financial management;
and
(iii)
rehabilitate and modernize irrigation networks and increase farmer involvement in water fee
determination and management o f maintenance.

Impacts

According t o OED, the project appears to have
been successful in overcoming institutional
problems which have been identified as key
constraints to the improvement of O&M
performance in other countries. The ON is
described as being transformed from a bloated
bureaucracy to a lean and efficient organization
accountable to both users and government.

Potential B a n k Role in Future o f Office du Niger

0

Bank could play an important role to facilitate future reform agenda, including:
Increased cost recovery to ensure the maintenance o f all infrastructure, including primary
infrastructure (whose maintenance i s currently financed by GOM), and payment o f all or part
o f the investment cost, given the increased profitability o f investments at ON. In parallel,
increased empowerment o f farmers and increased responsibility for O&M decisions;

Further reduction in the part o f O&M charges spent on overhead;
Increased land tenure security, while maintaining deterrents against non-payment o f O&M
charges;
Strengthening farmers' organizations for better proficiency in input purchase and output
marketing strategies;
Given the present profitability o f irrigated rice and vegetable production, facilitate increased
private sector investment in further development o f irrigation infrastructure, e.g., through
devising mechanisms, in collaboration with MIGA and IFC, for availing long term financing
to would-be private investors in the ON zone;
Continued support to improving access to markets to facilitate input purchase and
output/product distribution; and
Further attention to environmental externalities.

- 44 Yields increased from 1.8 to 5.5 M T k a (see figure 1) while the ex-post ERR was 30%, compared

Lessons Learned
For greater impact, sector reforms and investments require a conducive macro framework such as
the proper valuation o f the national currency, a l o w inflationary environment and a liberal trade
policy.

In addition, sectoral reforms should be accompanied by adequate complementary sectoral
investments in order to have a major impact.

A well-coordinated multi-donor effort i s essential for high impact investments which utilize
potential synergy and complementarity within and between sectors.
Farmer empowerment and transparency i s essential for greater water fee recovery and
sustainability in irrigation schemes, and the fee setting mechanism should be an independent and
transparent process, based o n clear needs and free from G o M interference.
Greater transparency in land management increases farmers' land security, even in the absence o f
land titles.

- 46 Attachment 3
Mali: I D A Lending and Debt Sustainability
Introduction

The enhanced HIPC Initiative reduced Mali’s external debt burden considerably. At i t s
recent completion point in March 2003, Mali’s creditors committed themselves irrevocably
to reducing Mali’s external debt by $417 million in NPV terms as o f end-1998, bringing the
NPV o f debt down from 184 percent to 126 percent o f exports as o f end-2002. This i s in
addition to the $121 million committed under the original HIPC Initiative. The Boards o f the
Bank and Fund concluded in March 2003 that in the absence o f major exogenous shocks, this
r e l i e f reduced Mali’s debts to a sustainable level. At the same time it i s widely recognized
that achieving long-term debt sustainability requires prudent debt management on the part o f
the authorities along with the provision o f financing on suitably concessional terms by the
international community.
Given that the completion point document was presentedto the Board in March 2003, the
macroeconomic projections underlying the completion point debt sustainability analysis have
been retained in this annex. The baseline scenario, predicated on base case IDA lending and
a successful diversification o f the export base, indicates that Mali’s debt to export ratio may
increase gradually over the next decade, but i s expected to remain under 150 percent, peaking
at 142 percent in 2014 and gradually declining thereafter. External debt service i s expected
to remain below 7 percent and 10 percent o f exports and revenues respectively over the
projection period. Sensitivity analysis, however, indicates that the NPV debt burden
indicators could rise sharply if Mali’s exports grow more slowly than projected or if M a l i i s
hit by exogenous shocks (such as declines in the price o f gold and cotton or a recurrence o f
drought).
Sensitivity Analysis

The baseline scenario i s predicated on continued fiscal consolidation, a gradual
diversification o f the export base, and the absence o f major external shocks. Reforms are
expected to increase productivity in the cotton sector and to stimulate greater value-added in
agricultural production and processing. Reforms to the legal system and regulatory
environment are expected to stimulate the private sector and attract foreign investment. The
base case scenario also assumes IDA grants at 29 percent under I D A - 13, Until the successful
diversification o f the export base i s achieved, however, Mali’s export earnings remain
exposed to price volatility, disruption o f transport links, and climatic conditions. The speed
with which the private sector will respond to the reforms undertaken by the G o M i s not yet
clear.
An alternative scenario i s therefore provided to indicate the effect on the NPV debt-to-export
ratio o f nominal annual export growth at 5.1 percent (the average growth rate 1998-2002)
from 2004 onwards (as compared with 6.6 percent average growth from 2004 onwards in the
baseline scenario). New borrowing i s kept to the levels projected in the baseline scenario,
and IDA lending i s assumed to be at the level o f the base case.

- 47 The evolution o f Mali’s debt-to-export ratio i s also very sensitive to the terms o f new
financing. A second alternative scenario therefore assumes a decreased provision o f capital
grants equivalent to half a percentage point o f GDP from 2004 onwards, and an equivalent
increase in the level o f concessional borrowing.
Figure 1 illustrates the impact o f these scenarios. In the case o f the lower exports scenario, in
the absence o f any moves to constrain new borrowing, the debt-to-exports ratio would
increase gradually and inexorably for the foreseeable future, passing the 150 ratio in 2014.
In the case o f the less concessional financing scenario, the debt-to-export ratio would peak at
151 percent in 2017. The debt-to-export ratio would stand 12 percentage points above the
baseline scenario at the end o f the projection period in 2021.

Given that debt service over the next five years i s expected to average $64 million per year
while 2002 exports stood at just under $1 billion, debt servicing ratios in the medium term
are not expected to present major difficulties. However, the results highlight that given the
combination o f high levels o f poverty reducing spending planned in M a l i and the narrowness
o f the country’s export base, an increase in borrowing, even on highly concessional terms,
could lead to debt sustainability problems in the long term. It i s therefore vital that in the
event the key ratios begin to show a clear upward trend, the authorities respond with a policy
o f curtailing new borrowing, replacing loans with grants, and appropriate measures to
encourage growth.

- 48 Impact o f new I D A lending

IDA i s the single largest creditor to Mali, accounting for 42 percent o f the country’s
borrowing in 1999-2002. In assessing the size o f the program, therefore, debt sustainability
must be a major consideration. The estimates suggest that assuming 29 percent o f the IDA13 allocation comes in the form o f grants, the NPV o f debt as o f end-2007 would be $79
million higher in the high case than in the l o w case lending scenario, and around $25 million
higher in the high case than in the base case. The difference betweenthe high and l o w case
lending scenarios would be equivalent to slightly over 5 percent o f the debt stock in NPV
terms. However, if the failure to maintain a good macroeconomic environment such as
would trigger the l o w case lending scenario were to reduce the rate o f export growth by a
third, then despite the lower rate o f disbursements the debt-to-export ratio would be 5 points
higher in the l o w case than in the base case by 2007, and by 2015 the debt-to-exports ratio
would stand at 170 percent as compared with 142 percent in the base case scenario.
Furthermore, as indicated in the CAS theme on promoting growth, the Bank’s program i t s e l f
i s aimed at assisting the diversification o f the Malian economy and stimulating further
sources o f growth.
The sensitivity analysis would suggest that the evolution o f Mali’s key debt ratios should be
watched carefully, to ensure that if the growth projections turn out to be optimistic, they do
not encourage over-lending by IDA or over-borrowing by the country. In the event that
exports do not increase at the level projected in the baseline scenario for reasons outside the
control o f the country, it i s essential that the international community respond with a greater
level o f concessional finance in order to avoid the reemergence o f an unsustainable debt
burden.

Core Labor Standards in Mali

Mali has ratified all 27 I L O conventions (two denounced in 2000, see below) which
include the five core labor standards:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Prohibition o f forced labor
The elimination o f discrimination in employment
Freedom o f association
Right to organize and bargain collectively
The elimination o f exploitive use o f child labor

I n 2000, GoM denounced two conventions referringto the minimum working age in both
industrial and non-industrial activities. However, attention in 200 1/2002 given to a child
trafficking ring from Mali to the Ivory Coast prompted GoM to launch an impressive
marketing campaign to raise awareness against child labor during the 2002 African
Nations Cup.

Mali: IMF -World Bank Relations
Partnership in Mali’s Development Strategy

Mali’s development objectives place increased emphasis o n poverty reduction and growth, as
reflected in i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved by the Government in
M a y 2002. Thejoint assessment o f the PRSF by the staff o f the World bank and IMF was
presented and approved by the respective Boards o f Directors in March 2003. The PRSP
process enabled the country to articulate an integrated growth and poverty strategy
framework for medium and long term development, building upon the national poverty
strategy formulated in 1998 with UNDP assistance and situating Mali’s main poverty
reduction challenges explicitly within a sound macro-economic framework. M a l i also
reached i t s HIPC completion point in March 2003, supported by the joint debt sustainability
analysis.

The IMF continues to take the lead in assisting M a l i in maintaining macroeconomic stability
and financial sustainability through setting quantitative targets within the framework o f the
Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF), which has been in place since August 1999 and
will expire in August 2003. Structural measures in the program are coordinated with the
World Bank and structural conditionality limited to areas with significant macroeconomic,
typically fiscal, implications. Thus the IMF’s structural performance criteria focus on cotton
sector reforms (measures impacting on the government’s transfers to the sector), and
structural benchmarks include measures related to public expenditure management (efficient
use o f HIPC and other resources) as well as civil service reform (primarily issues impacting
on the wage bill).
The World Bank continues to lead the policy dialogue on structural, social and institutional
reforms in a number o f sectors. A U S 7 0 million Structural Adjustment Credit was approved
by the World Bank Board in December 2001,comprising cotton sector reform and public
expenditure management reform measures. Other Bank operations that address, respectively,
private sector development, financial sector development, education sector reforms and
investment program, and health sector reforms and investment program, have been under
implementation for varying lengths of time. Progress i s being made in all these operations,
albeit slower than anticipated in some sectors.
The World Bank i s also leading the diagnostic trade study under the Integrated Framework
for Trade (IF), an initiative supported by the World Bank, IMF, World Trade Organization,
the UN Conference on Trade and Development, UNDP, and the International Trade
Commission. The M a l i IF, which i s being undertaken in collaboration with USAID, aims to
enhance Mali’s integration into the world economy and international trade policy
discussions. The trade diagnostic study will highlight Mali’s comparative advantages and
formulate an action plan for capacity building and technical assistance to promote export-led
growth, centered around selected agro-industries and some traditional knowledge industries
(namely music and handicrafts). The diagnostic report will be discussed at the next UN
Round Table for Trade, which i s tentatively anticipated to be held December 2003.

- 52 Bank Group Strategy

The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for M a l i was approved by the Board in April
1998. I t s focus i s on stable economic growth, and sustainable human development. The next
CAS currently being finalized, will be presented to the Board at the beginning o f FY04. The
new CAS supports elements o f the country’s PRSP, and the government’s desire to enter into
new relationships with i t s development partners based o n a gradually-phased transition from
projects to programmatic lending underpinned by more effective and efficient use o f aid
resources. I t i s envisioned that by the end o f the CAS period in FY06 programmatic lending
would comprise about a third o f the portfolio.
The Bank’s Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SACIII; US$70 million) to M a l i has as
to help M a l i restore the basis for stable economic growth by
objectives, the following: (i)
restructuring the all-important cotton sector to make it more efficient and capable o f
adjusting smoothly to changing international economic conditions; and (ii)
to improve the
tools for planning and managing public expenditures for more effective poverty reduction.
IDA support since FY99 has included lending for two projects aimed at strengthening the
basis for stable growth (a rural infrastructure project and a financial sector project); three
others focused o n human development (a health sector project supporting the country’s
decadal program - PRODESS; a project to improve learning in primary schools; and a longt e r m education sector project supporting the country’s decadal program - PRODEC) and
three in infrastructure.
The active portfolio comprises ten projects: three in rural development, three in infrastructure
and energy, two in health and education, one on financial sector and one on Structural
Adjustment. The performance o f the portfolio i s satisfactory overall, both in terms o f
development objectives and implementation progress. Non-lending analytical services under
the assistance program have comprised an irrigation strategy, a poverty and household
survey, a poverty profile update, and technical assistance on public expenditure reviews. I t
has also included monitoring o f economic developments together with the IMF and other
development partners in response to evolving domestic, regional and international economic
conditions. This activity has included assessing the impact o f the CBte d’Ivoire crisis o n
Mali’s economy, in view o f Mali’s landlocked status and consequent dependence on
neighboring countries (particularly CBte d’Ivoire) for the handling o f i t s trade flows. The
Bank i s also supporting capacity building on analytical skills for macroeconomic and poverty
analysis, as well as on sectoral medium-term expenditure frameworks.

An important element o f the Bank’s support to M a l i i s assisting the authorities to strengthen
governance and improve accountability in the use o f public resources. In this context, work i s
under way with the Malian authorities on capacity building for managing public financial
accountability. These efforts also extend to encouraging greater openness in the Malian
administration. An important step in that direction has been recently the willingness to share
the contents o f the forthcoming CAS with the population and interested donors. The
strengthening o f the knowledge base and the support for building capacity to handle fiduciary
imperatives should position M a l i for assistance through a Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit
in the new CAS period (FY04-06).

- 53 Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas

The IMF and World Bank staff maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting the
Government’s structural reforms. The recent April World Bank-IMF joint mission in M a l i
reinforced the good working relationships the two institutions entertain. As part o f i t s overall
assistance to M a l i through lending, country analytic work and technical assistance, the Bank
supports policy reforms in the following areas in collaboration with the Fund:
Cotton sector reforms

The objectives o f the cotton sector reforms are to safeguard the main source o f growth and
income generation o f the economy. Difficulties experienced in the late 1990s highlighted the
sector’s vulnerability to external shocks such as the continued decrease o f cotton prices o n
the international markets. The Government’s decision to pull out o f productive, industrial
and commercial activities has led it to design a reform strategy with the following objectives:
(i)
the improvement o f the flexibility and responsiveness o f the institutional structure o f the
cotton sector; (ii)
the reduction o f the risks associated with having only one operator; and (iii)
the establishment o f a higher visibility (transparency and capacity to anticipate) in the
management o f the sector. These objectives will be achieved through a comprehensive
program to redefine the parastatal company’s role in core cotton production activities,
increasing participation o f producers and the private sector in managing the cotton sector,
and liberalizing cotton and cottonseed o i l markets and enterprises.
In view o f the budgetary impact o f cotton sector losses, the Bank and the Fund collaborate
closely on the reform program, with the Bank taking the lead in the policy dialogue and
program implementation under the SACIII.

Public expenditure management

M a l i has made significant progress in the last several years to move the public expenditure
system closer to the desired level o f effectiveness, and the Government i s steadily
implementing measures in i t s ongoing reform program. The objectives o f the current reform
program are: (i)
improving the budget preparation process in order to progressively reach a
system that establishes solid l i n k s between the allocation o f public resources and the poverty
reduction objectives o f the development programs; (ii)
improving the efficiency and
effectiveness o f public expenditure execution; and (iii)
improving financial transparency and
managerial accountability in the use o f budget resources, through an effective expenditures
monitoring and control system and information reports on budget execution. These reforms
have been supported by the donor community including through successive World Bank
projects, and the donor community continues to work with the Government on the ongoing
reform program.
The reform program i s supported by the Bank under the SACIII which includes, among other
actions, a better integration o f the various budget documents, improving classification o f
expenditures to enable better poverty-oriented monitoring (including at the decentralized
level), automation o f budget execution through an integrated information system, actions to
improve the timeliness o f government account preparation, strengthenedinternal and ex-post

- 54 audit functions, and preparation o f a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) globally
and at key sector levels (initially in the social sectors and subsequently in rural development).

The Bank and Fund have collaborated in reviewing Mali’s public expenditure management
(PEM) performance, through the sharing o f SACIII mission documents and those o f the
Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) which, together, yielded a comprehensive action
plan for PEM reforms (ROSC AAP). The Fund FAD team has, consistent with the program

under the SACIII, provided technical assistance on specific areas, notably on the
classification o f poverty and HIPC expenditures. In 2002, the Bank undertook a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) that highlights key policy measures relating to
strengthening financial management in readiness for the potential shift to programmatic
lending. The C F A A recommendations have been incorporated in the forthcoming CAS and
progress in implementingthem will be monitored closely.
Privatization Program

M a l i has been engaged in far-reaching reforms in the private sector, which have been
supported through a telecommunications support program, a railway support program, a
financial sector development project, the SACIII (on the cotton sector), and the Private
the
Sector Assistance Project that closed in mid 2002. The program’s objectives are: (i)
reduction o f state ownership o f the banking sector to less than 20 percent; (ii)
the divestment
o f the state from t e n non-bank enterprises (either through the sale o f shares, liquidation, or
the establishment o f concession contracts)*; and (iii)
the continuation o f private sector
development initiatives, through enhancing competition and improving the business
environment in key sectors o f the economy. A key issue o f mutual interest to the Bank and
the Fund i s the associated retrenchment program (particularly for the railway and the cotton
sector), i t s potential impact o n the government budget and i t s precedent setting implications
for future privatizations, notably o f the telecom company. The Bank i s taking the lead in
evaluating the retrenchment plans in the course o f supervision o f the various sector reform
programs.

Eighteen non-bank enterprises were to remain in the government portfolio-those with majority government
holding - CMDT (cotton fiber), ON (agricultural development), RCFM (railways), OPAM (food management),
ONP (post office), PPM (pharmaceuticalsproducts market), PMU-Mali (horse racing), ADM (airport
management), COMANAV (river transport), CESPA (film production); and those with minority government
holding- EDM (electricity and water), SOTELMA (telecom), COMATEX-SA, (textiles) ITEMA (textiles),
SOMISY-SA (mining), SEMOS-SA (mining), ACI-SA (real estate), and SUKALA (sugar and alcohol).
