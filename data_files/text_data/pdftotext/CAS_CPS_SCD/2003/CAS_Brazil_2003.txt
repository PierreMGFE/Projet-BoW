A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

i

Executive Summary
i.

Brazil has an unparalleled potential and a unique opportunity today to increase the well-being o f

i t s people. This opportunity i s guided by the country’s vision for a more equitable, sustainable, and

competitive Brazil, as laid out in the recently published Multiyear Plan (PPA). At the same time, the
country faces macroeconomic risks, constraints to growth, social challenges, and environmental vulnerabilities. I t i s in this context o f opportunities and risks that this four-year (FY2004-2007), joint World
Bank-International Finance Corporation Country Assistance Strategy i s being presented.’
Opportunities, Risks, and the World Bank Group’s Role

ii.
Brazil’s new government i s committed to realizing the large potential for welfare improvements.
Brazil’s vast income disparities (its Gini coefficient o f 0.59 i s among the world’s highest) and high debt
burden (public debt to GDP ratio o f 57 percent) call for simultaneous actions on the economic and social fronts. Examples o f the government’s first steps are a start to social security reform, unification and
better targeting o f social programs, and continuing fiscal adjustment. These reforms have the potential to
improve public finances and social inclusion simultaneously, establishing a virtuous circle.

...

Economic growth i s crucial for development but has been elusive. In view o f the economic and
social context, growth must be generated with equity and sustainability-based on greater saving (national savings are only 17 percent of GDP) and higher productivity in resource use. Full savings come not
only from fiscal adjustment, but also from regulatory and microeconomic reforms, expansion of human
capacity, and sustainable use and conservation o f natural wealth-including the world’s largest rainforest
biome and freshwater reservoir. With a stronger role for the excluded in human development and for
small and medium-size companies in the growth process, productivity gains can be strong and equitable.
111.

iv.
The role of the World Bank Group in this process would be to support vital policy reforms and
innovative, well-performing investments, helping to lift the welfare o f Brazilians, particularly the poorest.
With a GDP o f around US$500 billion, Brazil i s the 9* largest economy in the world; the Banks lending
i s only about 0.4 percent o f Brazil’s GDP and less than 4 percent o f external financing. Yet, the potential
impact of this support at this time can be disproportionately large. This impact depends crucially how
well the approach i s focused, and how well i t leverages other efforts for greater scale.

v.
With this impact in view, the new CAS initiates a results-based approach. The country’s goals
and priorities are set out in the PPA and linked to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
benchmarks for 2007 and 2015 relate to human welfare gains, social, cultural and environmental sustainability, competitiveness, and macroeconomic performance, including growth. Specific Bank activities
would contribute to achieving these targets. There i s an accompanying framework for monitoring progress and results.
vi.
The overriding opportunity relates to the efforts to maintain economic stability with growth,
equity, and sustainability. For example, paying a higher price for a gradual reduction in indexed debt
can help reduce risks and promote investment financing and broad-based growth. Integrating multiple
cash transfers into one unified benefit can lead to a more efficient, well-targeted safety net with lower
fiscal cost and greater equity. The CAS builds on a growing sense at the national and subnational level
that development solutions require integrated responses.

The FY2004-07 CAS, following the federal and state electoral cycles, has been prepared in consultation with federal and state
govemments, civil society, the private sector, and the international community. I t i s based on the federal govemment’s Multiyear
Plan (PPA), September 2003; the recently published “Policy Notes” by the World Bank; the Completion Report for the FY00-03
CAS (Annex 2); the Operation Evaluations Department’s Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE); and Operations Evaluation
Group’s Country ImplementationReview (CIR).

vii.
Confronting risks to effective Bank assistance i s essential. While the Bank fully supports
Brazil’s ambitious fiscal adjustment program, the tight management o f public expenditures presents major
operational challenges. Implementation and disbursements o f investment loans have slowed, and the
space for new investments i s extremely limited. Blending the need for greater impact, and working within
the fiscal space, the proposed program reflects innovations in several respects.

M a i n Dimensions of the CAS

Brazil’s unique opportunities and risks challenge the Bank Group to pursue a more ambitious relationship aimed at greater impact. The program has a systemic approach with synergistic links to other
programs-rather than a project-by-project, sectoral approach. Specifically this translates into:

Continued key role for policy-based lending and technical assistance (up to 50 percent o f the
lending ceiling), to support systemic reforms. Examples for FY2004-2005 include human development, growth and competitiveness, sustainable development, and social security/fiscal reforms.
Sectorwide approaches (SWAps) as an investment lending platform to increase the systemic
benefits o f Bank support and mitigate the operational impacts o f fiscal austerity. Emerging examples are in social assistance, youth employment, and housing. Correspondingly, freestanding, oneo f f investment projects would be reduced or phased out.
An integrated approach in support o f multisectoral, rural and urban development strategies at the
subnational level-respecting the constraints required b y fiscal adjustment, including:
o

Transformation of the cooperation with state governments into integrated state strategies and projects, including public expenditure and policy analysis. Examples from
FY2004 are integrated programs for Tocantins, Pernambuco, Maranhgo, and AmapB,
covering both the rural space and urban centers.

o

A new emphasis on municipal governments as key partners. Under consideration in the
near term are operations for Rio de Janeiro and Betim.

A continued strong program in analytic and advisory activities (AAA) for a catalytic role in reform and program design, while focusing on a more effective exchange of lessons (based on conclusions o f the Country Assistance Evaluation) and on the development o f knowledge networks,
in close concert with the World Bank Institute and the Global Distance Learning Network.
Reinforcement o f the commitment to the Northeast and building a focus on the North-areas
with higher levels o f poverty-with a concerted effort to strengthen institutional capacity.
Together with IFC, strong, selective, and leveraged support to the private sector, cutting across
sectors and regions.

ix.
There would also be areas of increasing and of declining focus, o f entry and exit, as well as
differentiated support, showing selectivity from a larger l i s t o f important but not prioritized areas. For
example, there would be a stronger emphasis on inclusive growth, focused on productivity gains and
small and medium-size enterprises. Work on the quality o f public expenditures and governance would
replace the primary focus on the fiscal balance. Youth integration and culture, emphasized in consultation
with civil society, would be areas for a catalytic Bank presence, even if without significant lending.

...

111

x.
The IFC’s continued strong support to the Brazilian private sector w i l l accompany Bank assistance in enhancing the prospects for competitiveness and growth and improving social equity (Private
Sector Strategy, Annex 5). The growth objective would entail supporting growth-generating firms, export-enhancing activities including infrastructure and logistics, and activities improving access to longterm financing for private sector firms, including small and medium-size enterprises. Tighter market conditions could continue to require IFC to respond to the countercyclical needs o f the private sector. Under
the social equity objective, IFC would support firms committed to environmental and social sustainability, improved corporate governance, microfinance, socially oriented entrepreneurship, and assistance to
the government’s Zero Hunger (Fome Zero) program. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) would support the strategy by facilitating foreign investment.
Ranges and Cases for Assistance

xi.
Despite the clarity o f the government’s goals and the firmness o f i t s commitment, socioeconomic
and political uncertainties remain. The risks to stability, growth, and social progress are interwoven.
With a large public debt stock and external financing requirements, external shocks can be destabilizing.
On the domestic side, political support for reforms could weaken. Other risks range from slower growth,
which would affect debt sustainability, and implementation weaknesses in some areas, to droughts,
floods, rising deforestation, crime and violence, and youth unemployment.
xii.
This CAS proposes a graduated program o f support depending on policy progress and implementation o f the Bank program. Currently, higher and lower ranges of a base case scenario for Bank support are both plausible, while a low-case scenario i s possible but less likely. Under a higher range base
case, Bank support to Brazil could be about US$2.2 billion a year in the next two years-considerably
larger than in the past-and then declining to keep within exposure limits. Fiscal constraints o f the government are a key factor in whether a Bank program would reach this higher range. Under a lower range
base case o f up to US$1.5 billion a year, Bank exposure would increase modestly. The absence o f adjustment lending to Brazil in a low-case scenario would imply falling exposure.
xiii.
The indicators describing the lower and higher range base case scenarios involve progress
along all three thematic areas-quity,
sustainability, and competitiveness-as well as on the economic
foundations. Given the strong links across these areas, progress in one area alone, however strong, would
not be sufficient. To calibrate these cases in practice, a semi-annual review between the government and
Bank management would assess progress in policy reforms across the four areas, as well as development
outcomes and portfolio performance. These reviews would facilitate matching the program to performance. The Bank would prepare a CAS Progress Report around end-2005.
Agenda for Board Consideration
In light of this assessment and proposal, Board members may wish to discuss, among others, the
xiv.
following aspects o f this CAS:

.
.

The adequacy o f the priorities and the focus of the proposed assistance strategy in addressing
Brazil’s unique opportunities and risks.
The core design elements o f the CAS, including the proposed sectorally-integrated approach, results focus, and strategy to use programmatic support, including SWAps to increase the viability
and effectiveness o f investment lending.
The proposed indicators o f impact for determining the lower and higher base case ranges, with
increasing Bank exposure, and the proposed scale and mix o f lending.

I.Background and Recent Developments
1.
Brazil today has enormous potential. I t also faces huge challenges. After the “Brazilian miracle” o f the 1960s and 1970s, the 1980s and 1990s produced disappointingly low growth with persistently
high inequality. Despite low growth, however, the last decade saw substantial advances in the reform
agenda, including remarkable achievements in key social indicators and in price stabilization and fiscal
strengthening since the 1994 Real Plan. Economic advances were consolidated from 1998 onward-in a
period that included the 1999 currency crisis and other external and domestic shocks-through responsible fiscal management (underpinned by Brazil’s landmark Fiscal Responsibility Law), which brought r i s ing primary fiscal surpluses, and the introduction o f exchange rate flexibility under an inflation targeting
framework.

2.
The reform progress of the last eight years i s a strong basis on which to build. Within a short
time the new government has demonstrated remarkable commitment to sound macroeconomic management and social progress. If i t can manage external vulnerabilities and catalyze domestic support for reforms, Brazil seems to be poised to achieve far-reaching improvements in the welfare o f i t s citizens, in
particular the poorest. The success o f these efforts w i l l be the objective o f deepening Bank Group assistance and policy dialogue under this CAS.

A. Brazil’s New Government
3.
President L u i z Inhcio Lula da Silva was elected in October 2002 on a platform that emphasized increased social equity and faster growth. Building on the successes o f the previous administration,
the turnaround in fiscal and monetary management, and substantial social improvements, the new government’s dual focus i s maintaining macro stability while achieving more equitable growth and more
rapid social progress. The new government has committed itself to tight fiscal policy, inflation targeting,
and the honoring o f debt contracts. I t has also committed itself to far-reaching improvements in people’s
welfare-evidenced b y several high priority social initiatives, including efforts to eradicate hunger (Fome
Zero), create youth employment (Primeiro Emprego), and unify social transfer programs for greater effectiveness in reducing poverty (Bolsa Familia).
4.
The government recognizes that neither higher sustainable growth nor lasting social progress i s
possible without deep reforms. I t has quickly established credibility b y making prudent macroeconomic
choices and devoting early emphasis to key structural measures such as social security reform. Successful
pursuit o f reforms would enable Brazil to improve i t s access to international markets, reduce i t s external
vulnerability, and improve prospects for sustainable growth and social progress. The government also
recognizes that without the necessary domestic support, an opportunity to introduce lasting changes in
Brazil-benefiting current and future generations-may be lost.

5.
Several recent government actions-establishment o f the Council for Economic and Social Development (to discuss reforms with c i v i l society), meetings o f the President with Brazil’s 27 state governors, and the participatory preparation o f the four-year Multiyear Plan (Plan0 Plurianual, or PPA)represent promising initiatives for galvanizing the political and social support needed for reforms.
While party affiliations and alliances are typically weak in Brazil, the prospect of reforms has increased
over the course o f the year as the government has substantially expanded i t s support base in Congress.
B. Recent Social Progress
6.
Over the last decade, Brazil carried out significant reforms to expand the coverage, quality, and
efficiency o f i t s education and health systems and strengthen i t s safety net. Basic social indicators improved faster than in most other countries with similar income levels. Brazil’s income inequality im-

2

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

proved somewhat during the last decade but remains among the world’s highest, an expression o f the continuing social challenges.

7.
Brazil i s now close to achieving universal basic education.* In addition to a massive expansion
in basic enrollment (from 80 percent in 1980 to over 97 percent in 2002), there have been increases in
school grade promotion rates and in education expenditure and a reduction in regional differences in access and quality. More children are in school, parents and communities have more influence in the education system, more resources are being made available to disadvantaged groups, and more adults are able
to acquire new s k i l l s . Commitment to universal schooling helped drive these results.
The health of Brazilians has improved significantly. Infant mortality fell b y more than a third, to
8.
less then 30 per 1,000 live births. Child deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases are negligible. Maternal
health has improved, and the fertility rate has fallen to 2.2 percent. Mortality from infectious diseases i s
down substantially, and the number o f new HIV/AIDS cases has leveled off. The changing mortality patterns and decline in the fertility rate have contributed to an increase in life expectancy to 68 years. Deep
health system reforms over the last decade account for much o f this progress.

9.
Vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly, are now more effectively protected. B y
some definition, social safety net funding nearly tripled from 2000 to 2002. A series o f innovative conditional transfer programs targeted to poor children and youth promote school attendance, health care utilization, and community development. The rural poor also have a more effective safety net.
BOK1. Brazil’s Poverty Profile I s Increasingly Urban and Young
The evolution of poverty in Brazil over the last decade can be divided into three phases: a peak poverty rate of
36 percent o f the population in 1992-93, associated with high inflation and macroeconomic volatility; a sharp
decline to 30 percent by 1996 in the context o f the Real Plan which brought an end to high inflation and the resumption o f growth; and a relatively stable poverty rate o f 28-30 percent over the last five years, despite a sequence o f adverse external shocks and the slowdown of’ GDP growth.
Within the stable recent overall level, however, the profile ofpoverty has chunged significantly. The effects of
the recent economic slowdown have been felt primarily in metropolitan areas i n the Southeast-expressed i n
high unemployment rates and lower labor income i n these areas. As a result, poverty levels in metropolitan areas
increased sharply, with the Southeast share o f poverty increasing from I 7 to 26 percent from 1998 to 2001. As
rural areas were less affected b y slowing growth, the poorest populations were somewhat sheltered. Moreover,
improvements in social policy and program delivery (better access of the poor to public goods and services)
helped protect the poorest. Reflecting this, the Northeast share o f poverty decreased over the same period.
Other changes are also evident between 1998 and 2001. Poverty incidence among youths increased (the poor
below 14 years o f age increased from 36 to 39 percent o f total); the relationship between poverty and education
weakened somewhat (poverty fell among people with no or little education and increased in all other education
groups); arid the link between unemploynient and poverty strengthened. Still, poverty rates continue to be especially high for those with low levels o f education, as well as for indigenous and afro-descendent populations.

10.
The poverty rate has fallen sharply since economic stabilization in 1994, hovering around 28-30
percent (from 36 percent in 1992) since then.3But while the poverty rate i s stable, the poverty profile has

In this document, “basic education” refers to the “fundamental” cycle (grades 1 to 8), the Brazilian equivalent o f

Brazil has not yet defined an official poverty line. Different reports use different poverty lines and different methods, resulting in different poverty rates. The poverty line used here i s a per capita household income o f R$80 per

changed (Box 1). Poverty continues to be deeper in rural areas (53 percent) than in large metropolitan
areas (20 percent) and smaller urban areas (26 percent). But the rural poverty rate has fallen, as has the
share o f the population that i s rural, while metropolitan and urban poverty rates have increased. As a result, the share o f rural poor among all poor fell to 36 percent in 2001. While Brazil’s poverty continues to
be concentrated in the Northeast region (52 percent o f the poor), there has been a marked increase in poverty in the metropolitan areas o f the Southeast, which were hardest hit b y the economic crises o f 19981999 and 2001-2002. The related worsening o f crime and violence in urban areas threatens the quality o f
life and undermines confidence in government and public institutions. These factors call for a growing
focus on reducing urban poverty.

C. Economic Developments and Outlook
11.
Brazil has undertaken far-reaching economic reforms over the last decade, including trade
opening, elimination o f chronic inflation with the Real Plan in 1994, privatizations, and financial sector
reform^.^ At the same time, however, net public debt increased from 27 percent o f GDP at the end o f
1995 to 45 percent at the end o f 1999. This increase was partly related to successful stabilization and increased fiscal transparency. I t was due to a combination of several factors, including, among others, high
real interest rates, the devaluation in 1999, recognition of past liabilities, but also fiscal deficits. In October 1998, the government launched a fiscal stability program that combined stringent targets for the primary fiscal surplus with robust subnational fiscal adjustment. Key to achieving subnational adjustment
were new state debt refinancing agreements and the landmark Fiscal Responsibility L a w of M a y 2000.
The switch to a flexible exchange rate and inflation targeting in early 1999 was effective and created an
optimistic outlook b y 2000. During the year, the economy grew b y 4.5 percent, inflation remained low,
and the debt ratio stabilized.
12.
However, events in 2001 illustrated that Brazil’s public debt level, i t s reliance on foreign exchange-linked domestic debt to reduce financing costs, and i t s high external financing requirements had
left the economy vulnerable to shocks. Multiple shocks have combined to limit Brazil’s economic
growth to 1.5 percent or less since 2001. On the external side, these were the economic crisis in Argentina, global risk aversion away from emerging markets, higher o i l prices after September 11, 2001, and
l o w growth in the United States and Europe. On the domestic side, shocks included Brazil’s energy crisis
in 2001 and investor uncertainty during the 2002 presidential election. The value o f the real slipped from
about 2 to the dollar at the end o f 2000 to almost 4 in the fall o f 2002. The private sector lost access to all
but short-term external finance, which itself was limited. Public debt, mostly domestic but in a large part
indexed to the exchange rate and short-term interest rates, rose temporarily above 60 percent o f GDP,
mainly because o f the depreciation and high interest rates.

Amid these difficult circumstances, the government (both previous and current) redoubled fiscal
13.
discipline to control the public debt ratio and bolster Brazil’s economic credibility. The outgoing government entered into a US$30 billion Stand-by Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
in September 2002. This was based on a 3.75 percent o f GDP primary surplus target for 2003 (or higher if
required to stabilize the public debt to GDP ratio) and continuation o f the inflation-targeting regime.
14.
The newly elected government then sent strong signals o f i t s commitment to continuing fiscal
responsibility and reforms. In February 2003, the government announced a primary surplus target for
2003 o f 4.25 percent o f GDP, higher than any previous primary surplus. Subsequent reviews under the
IMF Stand-by Arrangement have been successful. Tight fiscal policy has been formalized in the draft
month (prices o f July 2001) in Sgo Paulo. This value i s s i m i l a r to the one used in the government’s Fome Zero program but different from the one used in other Bank documents, including the previous CAS.

Budget Guidelines Law (LDO) submitted to Congress in April 2003, which establishes a primary surplus
target o f 4.25 percent for 2003-2006 (Table 1). Early reforms, such as approval o f a Constitutional
Amendment that w i l l allow presentation of regular laws to modernize financial sector regulations, also
reinforced the commitment to sound macroeconomic management.
15.
The currency depreciation o f 2002 created inflationary pressures-year on year inflation reached
about 16 percent-which had to be contained through higher real interest rates. The Central Bank’s present system o f inflation targeting i s working effectively and has brought inflation and inflation expectations back under control. But the tight monetary policy has muted growth. Also, while social expenditures have been largely protected, drastic spending cuts have hit public investments in basic infrastructure
and other sectors, some of them critical for growth. Private investment has been hampered b y the s t i l l limited access to long-term finance, high interest rates, and microeconomic constraints.

16.
Growth in 2003 i s likely to be less than 1 percent and thus negative in per capita terms. Data on
industrial output since July 2003 indicates that a recovery i s underway. Such a recovery would be supported by the lower interest rates that have become possible since fear of inflation has receded. Mediumterm growth prospects w i l l s t i l l depend critically on pro-growth reforms. With good economic management and substantial progress on reforms, output growth could stabilize at about 4 percent a year. Though
not to be taken for granted, such a level o f growth could support substantial improvements in debt indicators over time and thus also contribute to financial stability.

17.
Faster growth depends on a coordinated push across several fronts. Anticipated decisions on
regulation o f infrastructure, particularly for energy and transport, should reduce investor uncertainty and
increase private sector participation. Institutional strengthening also has the potential to improve the execution o f regulation o f competition, infrastructure, and technology policy. Financial spreads should come
down as the Central Bank i s able to reduce reserve requirements and as other important reforms, such as
the new bankruptcy law, take effect. Non-distorting trade policies and institutional development to increase trade could also foster innovation and productivity.

18.
In the last months, the government has made important progress in some key reform areas. An
ambitious social security reform, with far-reaching fiscal and equity effects (bringing generous public
employee benefits more in line with the private sector while introducing a complementary fully funded
pensions pillar for civil servants), was sent to Congress in April after broad public debate. The lower
house approved i t in August, and the Senate i s likely to approve it before the end o f 2003. The reform
implies fiscal savings of more than half a percent o f GDP annually in the next 10 years (social security
regime for public and private sector workers t ~ g e t h e r ) .Some
~
o f the savings could be used to bolster
spending for efficient social programs, and some could be channeled into public investment, principally to
resolve critical infrastructure bottlenecks.
19.
Economic and fiscal stability are critical prerequisites for private investment and growth. The
primary fiscal surplus w i l l remain the main channel through which the government can signal fiscal responsibility to investors, decrease the public debt, and reduce borrowing costs, leading to increased private investment. Detailed analysis recently undertaken for the Country Economic Memorandum demonstrates that the current fiscal effort would ensure debt sustainability under a reasonable range of scenarios.6 In addition, the government has proven i t s ability and willingness to react to negative shocks with
additional fiscal efforts as needed.
20.
Even if reform measures pass as expected and growth picks up, public funds will remain scarce
given the government’s commitment to reduce the debt to GDP ratio (Table 2). A second class of reforms
to increase the impact of public spending and to increase private investment w i l l be critical. Most
important are measures to reduce regulatory risk in the main infrastructure sectors, an improved bankruptcy law (which recently passed in the lower house), and the removal o f unnecessary administrative
barriers to investment and technological innovation. A further push on microeconomic reforms, such as
strengthening the climate for investment and technological innovation, would further reinvigorate the
economy.

21.
A tax reform package with important potential impact on the competitiveness of firms i s also
under congressional review. Following initial agreement between the federal government and the states
(the broad contours o f both social security and tax reform received endorsement in the “Letter from Brasilia” signed b y all the state governors) and passage in the lower house, the Senate i s currently debating the
reform proposals.
22.
Brazil’s floating exchange rate system demonstrated i t s effectiveness in buffering the impact o f
recent shocks. L o w growth and a weak real led to a rapid adjustment of Brazil’s external accounts,
with inflation kept under control after an initial spike. Exports have responded favorably to a more stable,
depreciated currency, and export growth i s expected to be 4-5 percent over the medium term. The current
account deficit f e l l from 4.5 percent of GDP during 1999-2001 to 1.7 percent in 2002 (Table 2). The current account balance for 2003 w i l l likely be positive. Higher growth in the future would be consistent with
a moderate current account deficit. While external financing requirements remain high, projections suggest a manageable external financing picture (Table 3). However, vulnerabilities to large changes in capital market flows will persist for some time.
Markets have reacted positively to the government’s effective economic management. As o f
23.
October 2003, the exchange rate has stabilized below 3 reais to the US dollar (from around 4 re& to the
dollar in September 2002) and sovereign spreads have narrowed to below 600 basis points (from around
2,500 basis points). The debt to GDP ratio has stabilized at 57 percent.

24.
Brazil’s public debt stocks and external financing requirements nevertheless imply that substantial risks will remain for some time. Global risk aversion continues to slow the return o f capital flows
and foreign direct investment. Brazil’s debt indicators are sensitive to possibly lower growth rates and to
potentially volatile market sentiments. In an uncertain external environment, rising welfare and falling
poverty w i l l continue to rely on strong domestic reforms and fiscal performance, which require continuing political support for the reform path taken b y this government.

11. Brazil’s Development Challenges
A. Long-Term Vision, Multiyear Plan, and Results Framework
25.
Brazil’s long-term vision calls for greater equity, sustainability, and competitiveness. These
goals are based on the country’s vast progress and promise. Brazil ranks among the largest countries in
the world in population, landmass, and economy. I t i s endowed with highly entrepreneurial people, a rich
cultural heritage, precious natural resources, well-developed sociopolitical institutions, and a sophisti-

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

7

cated economy. Based on tremendous progress in the last decades, in particular in social indicators and
economic institutions, Brazil has laid the foundations for a decade of far-reaching improvements in people’s welfare.
This vision i s expressed in a set o f longer term development goals that build on Brazil’s eco26.
nomic development strategy and include the Millennium Development Goals. For example, fewer people
in extreme poverty and lower infant mortality rates lead to a more equitable Brazil, more equitable water
supply coverage brings a more sustainable Brazil, and higher trade volumes and fewer days to start a
business contribute to a more competitive Brazil. These goals are also relevant at the subnational level.
Some o f the more significant longer term development goals are shown in Table 4.

27.
Brazil’s development strategy i s defined in the federal government’s Multiyear Plan (Plano
Pluriannual, or PPA). Required by Brazil’s 1988 Constitution, the PPA i s an instrument both o f strategic orientation for economic development and o f medium-term resource allocation. The PPA organizes all
federal government spending for a four-year period (prepared in the first year o f a new government) b y
programs. A rolling three-year budget plan and individual annual budgets are integral parts o f the PPA
framework.

28.
The 2004-2007 PPA, entitled “A Brazil for All,” aims at progress along five dimensions:
economic, social, regional, environmental, and democratic (Figure 1). These interrelated strategic priorities are reflected in the PPA’s three core “macro” objectives: enhanced social inclusion and equality; economic growth (5 percent target for 2007) that i s environmentally sustainable and reduces regional inequalities; and empowerment and participation, contributing to better governance and public sector management. Submitted to Congress in September 2003 and expected to be approved b y November, the new
PPA lays out a program o f approximately US$150 billion annually over four years. Explicitly recognizing
Brazil’s budget rigidities and lack o f fiscal space, the PPA i s framed in financial terms consistent with the
country’s revenue projections. I t seeks to maximize private sector financing, particularly in the infrastructure investments that are key to growth. The strong priority assigned to the social inclusion agenda i s reflected in funding plans: social programs dominate planned PPA spending (57 percent), followed b y
growth-oriented programs (33 percent), and participation (10 percent). (More detail on the 2004-2007
PPA i s in Annex 1.)

29.
The new PPA deepened the results-focus of government expenditure planning. Each o f the
three macro objectives has 10 or so “challenges,” and each o f the 30 challenges has a group o f target indicators-to be achieved by 2007-that are the key drivers o f the PPA. Each o f the PPA’s 374 individual
programs i s aligned toward meeting one or more o f the 30 challenges and their target indicators.
30.
Features o f this PPA are a regional focus and a strong element of consultation with civil
society, including “participation fora” in each o f the 27 states. In this context, NGOs and CSOs have
called attention to possible negative environmental impacts of certain infrastructure investments (such as
dams, waterways, and roads) that have been included in the PPA. Following Brazilian legislation, these
investment projects are subject to environmental licensing and environmental impact assessments. In this
context, the Ministry o f Environment i s working with other ministries such as Energy and National
Integration to prepare environmental assessments o f key PPA infrastructure investments. The expectation
i s that investments would be modified as needed through the inclusion o f mitigation measures.
Appropriate responses would include the development o f integrated strategies to complement new
infrastructure investments with mitigation measures such as the establishment o f protected areas
corridors, improved frontier governance, and integrated regional development planning, among others.
C i v i l society organizations have formally offered to participate in the review o f PPA implementation to
assess the effectiveness of this process.

3 1.
Consistent with national legislation, state governments-elected in October 2002-are
also
completing PPA-like multiyear plans for 2004-2007. Several common themes reflect the clear national
objectives and challenges, including greater equity (improvements in the Human Development Index
(HDI) i s a primary goal in nearly all states); improved economic productivity and competitiveness (such
as efforts to reduce bureaucratic “red-tape’’ in Cearfi); an integrated view of development actions (such as
the importance o f public expenditure management to improve social sector efficiency in Pemambuco);
sustained fiscal adjustment and public spending reform (such as ambitious administrative reforms in Minas Gerais); and a results focus, starting with goals and desired outcomes and systematically measuring
and monitoring progress, that i s evident in virtually every state.
32.
The themes of a more equitable, sustainable, and competitive Brazil-in the context of macroeconomic stability-are thus at the heart of the vision set out in the new national and state PPAs.
These themes are mutually reinforcing. Better education outcomes w i l l bring greater opportunity, reducing income inequalities and creating jobs and growth over time. Improved water supply w i l l lead to
healthier children and a more productive workforce. Sustainable use of natural resources w i l l attract investment and stimulate growth. Thus while each theme i s treated separately below, the greatest impact
w i l l come from a holistic approach that recognizes and explicitly builds the linkages among themes.

B. A M o r e Equitable Brazil’
33.
Social progress i s essential to improve the quality of life of the least advantaged groups. The
importance o f attaining social progress already in the short term and simultaneously with economic stabilization i s further highlighted by the ambitions, expectations, and hopes that rest on this government.
Rapid social progress would consolidate broader support for economic responsibility and difficult reforms, thus strengthening the foundations for growth and for even faster social progress in the future.

’This and the following sections draw from a set of “Policy Notes,” in 14 sectors that were prepared by the Bank for

the incoming government in 2002 and discussed with federal government counterparts and with numerous state governments. “Brazil: Equitable, Competitive, Sustainable-Contributions for Debate,” World Bank Report 25049-BR,
2003.

34.
Despite recent progress (and with incomplete measurement o f the effects o f transfer programs)
Brazil i s s t i l l one o f the world’s more unequal societies: the richest 1 percent o f the population receives 10
percent o f total monetary income-the same share as the poorest 50 percent. Analysis shows that income
inequality in Brazil stems primarily from unequal access to education and a high s k i l l premium for labor,
along with a highly regressive pension system. A more equitable Brazil w i l l invest in and empower people, especially the poorest. Higher quality and more equitable access to education (including secondary
and tertiary education) are key to reducing poverty and inequality. However, the positive impacts o f education reform take time to materialize. Reforms to social assistance cash transfer programs and a more
equitable pension system can achieve complementary results sooner and substantially reduce inequality.’
35.
Brazil’s long-term goals for achieving greater equity include improving knowledge and skills,
promoting longer, healthier lives, and reducing vulnerability and extreme poverty (reducing extreme poverty b y half b y 2015-Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1, shown in Table 4). Achieving these
goals w i l l help Brazil improve i t s standing in the widely used United Nations Human Development Index
(HDI), which combines per capita income, educational levels, and life expectancy. In 2000, Brazil ranked
73 on the HDI, even though i t s ranking by per capita GDP was 60. Some o f the key outcomes targeted
over the next four years and the strategies to achieve them are discussed below (see also Table 9, on page
41). Broad-based economic growth, b y generating employment and income, i s essential for reducing poverty and i s discussed in the section on a competitive Brazil. The provision o f local services such as housing, water, sanitation, and others i s discussed in the section on a sustainable Brazil but can also make a
critical contribution to a more equitable Brazil.
36.
Brazil has made great strides in education since the early 1990s. Over 97 percent o f children
ages 7-14 attend school (MDG 2), with education indicators for girls exceeding those for boys (MDG 3;
see Table 4). These gains, rather than being a corollary o f economic growth-which was very modest
during the period-arose from policy changes and strong federal initiatives to boost enrollment, including
programs guaranteeing funding per child, such as Fundescola and FUNDEF, combined with effective decentralization to states and municipalities.
37.
Brazil i s an example for education reform; but indicators still lag due to i t s low starting point.
The most equitable way forward would be to help more o f the poorest children complete grade 8. But for
the workforce to be globally competitive, Brazil needs more secondary school graduates. The government
i s pursuing both objectives. Key policy reforms under consideration include renewal o f the FUNDEF
(primary school) funding mechanism, with expansion to secondary education; improvements in teacher
s k i l l s and pedagogical reforms to improve classroom teaching; measurement o f school quality against
standards to help monitor and improve equity across schools, directing capital spending and teacher training to struggling schools; expansion o f subsidized preschool programs targeted to low-income families;
and improved access for rural students and for urban students in grades 9 through 11.
38.
Infant mortality f e l l from nearly 48 per 1,000 live births in 1991 to less than 30 in 2000 (MDG 4;
see Table 4). Maternal health improved (MDG 5). L i f e expectancy at birth increased b y two years, to 68.
Few other countries have equaled this progress. Again, good public policies and implementation have
made the difference. Most important have been the universal provision o f services (the Unified Health
System, or SUS), focused programs (such as HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, which have leveled off
the rate o f new cases; MDG 6), decentralization, and greater participation o f communities (as in municipal health boards).

Box 2. Flagship Social Programs of Brazil’s New Administration

The Forne Zero Progrant seeks to eliiniriate hunger and to guarantee food security to all Brazilians. As a multidimensional program, i t includes a Food Card Program (Programa Cartilo Alinientagilo), which transfers cash to
targeted poor families; emergency interventions for specific groups (landless, indigenous, and quilombolas; direct food purchases to stimulate family agriculture; school feeding and mother and infant nutrition sche.mes; and
creation of a food bank. I t also includes more structural interventions such as literacy courses, construction of
water tanks and small-scale irrigation, support to family agriculture, and assistance with needed documentation.
Pome Zero i s innovative i n i t s participatory approach and i t s promotion of public-private partnerships (through
widespread food collection, donation sites, and private sector participation at the municipal level), including
with IFC.
The Primeiro Emprego program tackles youth unemployment through the insertion of youths into the labor
market, by providing incentives for firms to hire youths, and incentives for entrepreneurship and selfemployment; job readiness, including actions to promote apprenticeships, internships, and community work; and
social participation. including the promotion o f partnerships between government and the private sector and between government and civil society.
The government i s also working to integrate the multiplicity o f federal cash transfer program-Bolsa Escola,
Bolsa Alimenta@o, Cartilo Aliinenta@o, and the Auxilio Gas-into a single unified benefit (the Bolsa Fantilia
program). This would correct coverage gaps, duplication. and inequities among existing programs; increase
transparency and consistency in beneficiary selection; build greater institutional resilience; and reduce administrative inefficiencies. The unified program aims to reduce the incidence and intensity of extreme poverty in Braz i l through a direct monetary transfer to the most needy families and to reduce future poverty through incentives
for beneficiary fanulies to invest in human and social capital and rationalizationof the safety net.

39.
But disparities remain large in health care funding across regions and in utilization rates
across social groups. Many o f the poorest still lack access to basic services. And poor quality and inefficiency hamper the system. Key elements of the government’s reform program include changes in resource allocation and provider payment mechanisms to improve equity and efficiency; expansion o f the
Family Health Program to poor urban areas; further decentralization combined with performance-based
management and financing to raise the efficiency o f the SUS; and health promotion and social interventions to reduce noncommunicable diseases. Universal provision o f adequate water and sanitation services
i s also key to improved health outcomes.
Brazil’s labor market suffers from low job creation, declining participation, rising unemployment, l o w productivity, frequent litigation, high informality, and inadequate income security. Labor market reforms can contribute to more j o b creation and higher quality jobs and to reduced informality.”
While labor market reforms are contentious, the government has indicated that i t intends to tackle some
key issues within this agenda.

Brazil has a wide array o f social protectionprograms. While many programs are promising, the
overall system could be improved. Better targeting would improve equity, reduce benefit leakages to the
nonpoor, and promote greater inclusion o f the poor. All programs could use better monitoring and evaluation to provide feedback for ongoing improvements. Program duplications in target groups and administrative functions need to be addressed. As part o f a push for greater social progress, the government i s
beginning to integrate many federal cash transfers into a single, better targeted program (the Bolsa
Familia. It has also launched such new initiatives as the Fome Zero program to eliminate hunger and

42.
Equity i s also undermined by high crime rates, which affect the poor more deeply. Urban violence problems are worsening, and solutions remain elusive. The government recognizes the importance
o f this issue and i s pursuing promising initiatives along three broad lines o f actions. Over the long term,
social progress at the macro-level, with more and better income opportunities would help reduce crime. In
the near term, community-based approaches involving the local population and local governments have
shown results (Box 3). Urban upgrading programs in slum areas can also be an entry point for community
and cultural activities, microcredit, and other opportunities. Improved performance o f the police and judiciary could also help lower crime rates.

Policies to improve the quality o f public spending and service delivery to the poor are crucial.
They include social security reforms and integration o f social transfers (currently pursued by the government), broader public spending reforms aimed at increased flexibility and effectiveness o f public spending, better evaluation and monitoring o f spending overall and in individual programs, and increased transparency and participation in public decision processes.

C. A M o r e Sustainable Brazil
45.
A more sustainable Brazil w i l l help reduce poverty and achieve a higher quality o f l i f e for a l l
Brazilians in the rural areas and in the urban centers. A healthy natural and physical environment w i l l
provide basic services in both urban and rural areas in a sustainable, efficient way (MDG 7). I t w i l l build
on the country’s comparative advantage in natural resources-Brazil i s home to some o f the world’s most

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

13

important natural assets, including the Amazon, the largest rain forest biome in the world, containing b y
far the largest portion of remaining rain forest and up to a fifth of the world’s freshwater-while also conserving them. A sustainable Brazil w i l l also be a source of competitiveness and provide wealth for the
future.

46.
Brazil’s long-term goals to achieve greater sustainability include enhanced and more equitable
access to urban and rural basic services such as water supply and sanitation, better water quality and water
resource management, more sustainable land management, protection o f forests and biodiversity, and
greater social inclusion. Highlights o f targeted outcomes over the CAS period and strategies for achieving
those outcomes are discussed below (see also Table 10 on page 43).
47.
The growing number o f urban poor depend more than other groups on public services to protect
and enhance their assets. Many urban poor are not served b y water and sanitation sources; many spend
hours on public transportation to get to and from work. Water and air pollution, along with their health
consequences, are predominantly urban problems, and they affect the poor most. And in peripheral urban
areas many poor people do not have secure property rights to their land and housing, severely curtailing
their ability to participate in credit markets and even some labor markets. Urban housing and land markets
do not function equitably, largely because o f lack o f adequate land and the infrastructure to serve that
land. Law and order i s a fundamental public good of obvious relevance in urban areas. All o f these concerns interact with the continued growth o f informal settlements (some 350,000 newcomers arrive in Si50
Paul0 alone each year), which strains local governments’ capacity.
48.
W i t h urban growth comes demand for housing, water supply, sanitation, drainage, wastewater
pollution control, solid waste management, and urban transport. The government has demonstrated i t s
focus on urban policy through the creation o f a new Ministry o f Cities. Among the priorities, reforming
local master planning, subdivision regulations, building codes, and zoning ordinances would improve
land use and increase the supply o f land for low-income housing to arrest the growth o f informal settlements. Local upgrading programs would put more emphasis on tenure and registration (MDG 7). Federal
housing programs might become matching grant schemes for states and municipalities and include nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for urban upgrading. Public transport systems, another asset important to the poor, contribute to the value o f land and housing assets when markets are functioning well.
49.
Water supply and sanitation services are the responsibility o f states and municipalities, though
several federal programs support the subnational governments. Access i s uneven. The poor are least likely
to have adequate service, with a large part o f the unserved population living in small municipalities, periurban areas, and favelas. Very little collected wastewater i s treated, adding to health hazards and environmental degradation, especially in urban areas. Although utility tariffs are generally adequate, half the
state utilities require fiscal support to meet operational deficits. If utility managers had the incentives and
autonomy to improve efficiency, the gains could be allocated to better service coverage and quality for
the poor. Services could also be improved with a clearer legal and regulatory framework, and tariff and
bulk water pricing reforms to promote conservation and efficiency. Growing urbanization i s straining the
capacity of the sector to expand services: during the 1990s the number o f new connections barely exceeded the number o f new urban households.

50.
An integrated approach to water pollution control and urban upgrading can enhance the
benefits of a wide range o f interventions. Poor households are more willing to contribute to the costs o f
sewerage and other urban services if they have some security o f tenure. The health benefits o f effective
solid waste management and drainage complement those o f water supply and sanitation and are essential
to urban water pollution control. Integrated approaches to water pollution and urban upgrading depend on
cooperation among a variety o f actors and revitalization o f effective metropolitan governance. Successful

14

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

urban water control projects in the states o f Minas Gerais, Parani, and Siio Paul0 have shown the effectiveness o f an integrated, metropolitan approach, which directly involves the affected municipalities.

5 1.
An adequate rural strategy i s invariably one that i s integrated with various sectoral interventions
in the rural space as well as with the urban strategy.” Rural and urban interventions interact through mobility and the related effects on poverty, employment and growth. Several strands o f the rural strategy
have advanced in Brazil, but now more than ever, there i s the need to seek integration across them for
greater impact and scale. The states are trying to bring together the effect o f investments and policies o f
individual sectors such as education, health, water supply and sanitation, rural roads, and the environment
for stronger impacts on goals such as the reduction in infant mortality or better school achievements.
More generally, this would be an effort to bring together the rural poverty focus with the sustainable use
o f natural resources, be i t in the Northeast, the North, or the South.

52.
The rural poor live from the land or from services related to agriculture. The 1996 Agricultural
Census shows 4.5 million rural households with insufficient land for subsistence. These households are
likely to be home to most o f the 16.5 million rural poor in Brazil, with the largest share living in the
Northeast. Many lack basic services such as electricity, access to paved roads, or sufficient water for human consumption and crop irrigation. Research in the Northeast shows that family farms can be more efficient and labor-intensive than large farms. Brazil has made progress in improving the distribution o f
land ownership and securing property rights for poor landowners, and the new government emphasizes
this issue strongly. Complementing the acceleration o f i t s traditional land reform program, the government has developed community-based approaches to improve access to land and increase productivity.
This approach builds on rural poverty reduction programs, primarily in the Northeast, that provide l o w
cost basic local services such as power and water through community associations.

53.
Managing natural resources i s crucial for poverty reduction in a country o f Brazil’s natural
wealth, but i t i s yet to become a priority. Particularly in the North and the Northeast, natural resources
constitute a much higher proportion (some 80 percent) o f the assets o f the poor than o f the rich. Ensuring
the preservation and controlled use o f these resources i s thus linked to equity as well as sustainability.
Many experiences worldwide with sustainable use o f natural resources could serve as a basis for a sound
environmental strategy with social inclusion. Conservation strategies should also be linked to efforts for
poverty reduction and sustainable growth. The near disappearance o f Brazil’s unique Atlantic forest illustrates the urgency o f action.
54.
Water i s abundant in some areas and scarce in others. About 70 percent o f Brazil’s fresh water i s
concentrated in the Amazon Basin. The semi-arid Northeast region, with 28 percent o f the population, has
only 5 percent o f the country’s water resources. In the humid and industrialized South and Southeast regions, with nearly 60 percent o f the population, water pollution problems are severe. While Brazil’s
achievements over the past half-century have been strongly tied to the development o f i t s water resources,
urgent new issues in water resource management present challenges with strong poverty implications.

55.
Historically, water resource management in Brazil has been fragmented, has prioritized new
investment over operation and maintenance, and has often neglected environmental considerations. Since
the 1990s, Brazil has sought to overhaul i t s water management framework, with a focus on improved
management and investment allocation. Brazil now has a modem legal and institutional framework for
water resource management, but implementation has barely begun, and the potential o f recent legal and
institutional innovations has not yet been realized. The PPA makes improved water resource management
in the arid Northeast a specific priority. Rapid and immediate progress can be made through the comple11

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

15

tion and extension o f several ongoing projects within a Northeast water program, as compared to the start
up o f large water transfer initiatives with long gestation periods. Successful models o f community-driven
micro-catchment water basin management, such as those developed in the states o f ParanA and Santa Catarina, could be replicated or adapted elsewhere, particularly in the Northeast.
56.
The recent increase in Amazon deforestation rates (provisional data show 25,400km2 in 2002
compared to an average of 18,480km2 for 1993-2002) illustrates the continuing threat to key ecosystems.
Recent research shows that, in contrast to the 1970s and 1980s when occupation o f the Brazilian Amazon
Forest was largely induced by government policies and subsidies, much recent deforestation i s caused b y
medium- and large-scale cattle ranching, which i s increasingly profitable and dominated b y more efficient
and professional agents. Controlling open access in the interior, while promoting the sustainable use o f
forested areas, i s key to avoiding as-yet poorly understood damage that would foreclose future options.
B y bridging environmental and social policies, Brazil could in some form protect up to half the existing
Amazon Forest, and as a result o f sustainable development ensure the living standards and legitimate aspirations o f the local population.

57.
Preserving other biomes, equally important to Brazil’s poor, notably the Caatinga and Cerrado,
w i l l require establishing a system o f protected areas sensitive to local land use dynamics. Overall, there i s
increasing recognition of the need for better policies and stronger institutions to manage Brazil’s natural resources. A growing domestic constituency supports sound environmental policies. Yet despite efforts, progress remains modest. Even where advances have been made, implementation capacity i s weak
compared with the magnitude o f the challenges ahead.

D. A M o r e Competitive Brazil
58.
A more competitive Brazil would boost growth and exports through gains in productivity, increasing employment and income for all groups. Brazil’s government i s developing a cross-cutting program to pursue higher, more sustainable growth b y simultaneously improving conditions for investment
and for higher productivity. This means reducing long-term public liabilities (especially in the public pension system) to create fiscal space for public investment and cut the cost o f capital; reducing impediments
to innovation and investment stemming from excessive regulation and bureaucracy; addressing trade barriers, including high logistics costs; moving toward a more efficient and deeper financial sector; and investing more in human capital, in particular in secondary education. Such progress would be best made
through structural reforms (such as pension reform or trade reform) rather than through special subsidies
or tax exemptions to capital, that in Brazil and elsewhere in the past have neither contributed to growth
nor to equity.I2
59.
The government recognizes that growth w i l l come predominantly from private sector activities.
The Private Sector Strategy Annex to this CAS (Annex 5) identifies several constraints to entrepreneurship, investment, and innovation: access to financing and financial intermediation costs; logistics costs;
infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in energy; the business environment and the regulatory framework;
and labor productivity and human capital development. The so-called “Custo Brad”-broadly defined by
this l i s t o f impediments-is thus the main obstacle to Brazil’s competitiveness.
60.
A stronger focus on productivity and deep reforms to the investment climate i s needed. The
investment climate improved considerably with macroeconomic stabilization, but sluggish growth continues, posing new threats o f slowing social progress, greater difficulty in attaining fiscal balance and cutting
debt ratios, and weaker export performance. Brazil’s long-term goals for increasing competitiveness,

The New Growth Agenda,” World Bank Report No. 22950, December 2002.

16

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

along with some o f the more targeted medium-term outcomes and strategies to achieve them, are discussed below (see also Table 11 on page 48).

61.
Increased’investments in energy and in transport to cut logistics costs are key to enhancing
trade and competitiveness: without renewed investment, Brazil risks new energy supply constraints and
increasing transport costs. But fiscal constraints severely reduce options for public investment. The regulatory framework for private infrastructure investments remains a source o f uncertainty. The government
has announced i t s approach to a new regulatory framework, with clear definition o f the role of independent regulatory agencies and a call for strengthening this important professional cadre. Although support
for privatization has waned in the face o f limited protection o f the interests o f consumers and investors,
fiscal limitations dictate that progress on public-private partnership i s key. The government has also developed a law to underpin this area (Box 4).
Box 4. Brazil I s Developing a New Framework for Public-Private Partnerships
Recognizing the need to resolve infrastructure bottlenecks to economic
growth while maintaining fiscal discipline, the federal government has prioritized increasing private sector participation in the provision of ingrastructure services. The current legal framework i s a barrier, including the
concessions law. I t unduly restricts the criteria that can be used for selecting
concessionaires, does not allow for the participation o f the public sector in
concession financing, and makes unclear financial guarantees to concessionaires that discourage efficiency.

The challenges are to tnake the legal fratnework for private participation
more flexible and predictable; to review the principles used to structure concessions, to ensure better coverage o f the poor and increase private sector
participation; to revise tariff structure models and clarify pricing rules; and
to strengthen regulatory, antitrust, and project preparation capacity.

62.
The
government’s
approach to the energy sector remains to be defined in
detail. The speed o f investment and capacity expansion
in the sector remains contingent on these decisions. The

and could become a crucial
part o f the growth agenda,
while also diminishing macroeconomic vulnerability. Bank research suggests that increased trade would
also be pro-poor. l3Unilateral, regional, or multilateral trade reform would benefit the poor more than
proportionately, whereas import substitution industrialization policies, which tend to favor capital, are
less pro-poor. But beyond domestic export promotion, i t i s imperative to recognize Brazil’s role in international trade negotiations and the vital importance o f improved access to the markets (particularly in agriculture) o f Brazil’s main trading partners.

64. A stronger innovation system i s another key component o f the growth agenda. Brazil i s attempting to
strengthen university research and i t s links with the private sector through (partially competitive) subsidies to research in selected areas. Further improvements are possible: a new Innovation Law now being
sponsored by the government aims to spur progress in this area.

65.

In contrast with some other Latin American economies, Brazil has many large firms. They offer
an opportunity for growth by building competitive value-chains that create linkages between large and
small companies. For this, access to long-term investment financing for both small and large firms i s
important.

66.
The growth o f small companies i s critical for productivity: new entrants typically show higher
than average productivity growth. But in Brazil, most small companies are informal and must ultimately
become formal in order to grow. The cost o f formality i s high. Many measures to decrease administrative
barriers to enterprise creation and innovation are therefore under discussion, including a reduction in the
number o f documents required for business registration and a centralized system with one identification
number for the company nationwide. Brazil has introduced some important simplified systems for firm
registration and taxation (Sistema F6cil and SIMPLES), although this i s a complex area, making rapid
simplification difficult. One of Brazil’s high-level economic councils may be charged with reassessing
regulations and bureaucracy.
67.
Although Brazil’s financial sector i s sophisticated and systemic risk i s low, it lacks depth,
and intermediation spreads are among the highest in the world. Financial sector efficiency i s an important factor for higher growth potential in the economy. There i s thus a remaining agenda o f financial
sector reforms that may be addressed gradually in the present CAS period. Government proposals for improved regulation o f financial competition and bankruptcy law are an important stage in this process. Braz i l has made significant progress in establishing a comprehensive anti-money laundering institutional
framework and implemented the corresponding instructions in the banking system.

Brazil’s public banks hold more than 40 percent o f financial sector assets. They have access to
special funding sources and undertake a large share o f directed lending. Fortified by recent recapitalization, the federal banks have strengthened their governance practices and fiscal transparency with the aim
o f reducing the risk o f new public sector liabilities. Their evolution w i l l determine not only their soundness but also the development o f the rest o f the financial system, as public banks currently absorb a substantial share o f private savings. Strategies differ for each public bank, but clear mandates w i l l be important. The government does not currently propose major structural reforms in this area.

68.

69.

Even with the strong role of public banks, access to financial services i s unevenly distributed
away from the poorest. Small entrepreneurs have little access to finance. The expansion o f financial services to small-scale entrepreneurs, which could be aided b y new technologies, could increase employment
and economic inclusion, and the sustainable expansion o f microfinance and nonbank financial services
might also offer employment growth. The government has launched promising initiatives to address some
o f these issues.

70.
The tax reforms currently being pursued b y the government are important primarily for reducing
distortions and administrative burdens in a system with high tax rates and comparatively high levels o f
total tax revenues. For example, a more efficient tax structure would not penalize exporters and laborintensive companies. Through its current tax reform proposal, the government aims to phase out the Social Contributions Tax (COFINS) and the Social Integration ProgramProgram o f Assistance to C i v i l Servants (PISPASEP) taxes, replacing them with a federal value-added tax (VAT). Further reforms in the
medium term could aim at increasing the share o f direct taxes relative to that o f indirect taxes.
71.
Finally, regional policies are central to the government’s agenda. Spurring growth in the North
and Northeast regions could have an important impact on equity. Each region could build on i t s unique
comparative advantages to attract investment-natural and cultural assets for tourism in the Northeast, for
example, and biodiversity assets in the North-but historically many impediments have prevented regional policies from bringing about greater equity across regions.

18

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

E. Foundations: A Stable Economy and Good Governance
72.
Macroeconomic stability and good governance are the foundations for an equitable, sustainable, and competitive Brazil. This includes, in particular, effective monetary and fiscal policy, structural
reforms to reduce expenditure rigidities, measures to increase the quality o f spending, as well as public
sector management reforms, transparent and inclusive decision-making processes, and an effective justice
system. Further trade integration, which depends on actions b y Brazil and i t s trading partners, could reduce external vulnerability. Measurable medium-term objectives include price stabilization and reduction
o f the debt to GDP ratio. An international investment-grade rating for government bonds would be a tangible overall indicator o f success. Brazil’s goals to maintain sound macroeconomic management and good
governance, and key policy levers for the medium-term, are discussed below (see also Table 12 on page
52).
73,
Within the macroeconomic framework, fiscal discipline continues to be critical. With the consolidation o f fiscal responsibility, the focus has shifted from just ensuring fiscal balance to improving the
sustainability and quality o f fiscal adjustment. Similarly essential i s effective implementation o f the inflation-targeting regime. With responsible monetary and fiscal management and the ongoing strengthening
o f fiscal rules and institutions, Brazil w i l l keep building i t s reputation and credibility. Credibility could be
further strengthened through explicit fiscal rules and institutional arrangements to guide medium-term
fiscal policy that combine the long-term objective o f fiscal sustainability with the short-term objective of
reducing the procyclical bias of fiscal policy.
74.
Despite competent macroeconomic management, vulnerability related to the levels and the
structure of Brazil’s public debt i s likely to continue for some time. Progress in public debt management, including the most recent reduction in the share of exchange rate-indexed public debt, has been
substantial. Consolidating and institutionalizing this progress would further reduce fiscal risks.
75.
Responsible macroeconomic management i s essential, but i t i s not enough for Brazil to maintain
i t s credibility while also attending to the many social demands and expectations. Effective fiscal disci-

pline combined with considerable budget rigidity-resulting from the extensive earmarking o f revenues and high mandated expenditures-has circumscribed the government’s ability to allocate, or reallocate, budget resources to i t s priorities. Addressing the structural rigidity o f the government budget, improving the quality o f public spending, and upgrading public expenditure management are necessary
complementary objectives for fiscal sustainability .

76.
Until recently, fiscal efforts were concentrated on the revenue side. They have increased public
sector revenues to above 35% o f GDP, which i s very high in comparison to other middle-income countries and leaves no room for additional taxation. Therefore, to increase the government’s capacity to respond to society’s demands while maintaining fiscal discipline, fiscal expenditures need to be reallocated
to well-crafted public interventions. Such reallocations would increase the quality o f public spending,
concentrating scarce resources on effective reduction of poverty and inequality and promotion o f economic growth. In this context, the government i s pursuing essential structural fiscal reforms. Most important i s the proposed reform o f the social security system, which would gradually increase the fiscal
space for pro-poor and pro-growth public expenditures. Other structural reforms include the extension of
a revenue de-earmarking arrangement (DRU), which would increase the federal government’s spending
flexibility; changes in the public employment law; and other measures to reduce budget rigidity.

77.
An additional challenge facing Brazil in coming years i s to improve the quality of public expenditures and the efficiency and impact o f government programs within the tight fiscal constraint expected
for the foreseeable future. Evidence suggests that although Brazil’s public sector spends a relatively high

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

19

share o f GDP (3 1 percent for primary spending), these expenditures are often poorly targeted and inefficiently executed. Brazil has yet to develop a robust system o f program and expenditure monitoring and
evaluation, and public sector management i s still largely rule-bound rather than performance oriented.
While the federal government made significant progress by initiating annual evaluations for i t s Multiyear
Plan (PPA), there i s s t i l l ample scope for strengthening this new system b y improving the monitoring and
evaluation methodologies used and institutionalizing them within a coherent government-wide system.
W i t h a more effective monitoring and evaluation system, the contribution o f the PPA to allocational efficiency could be enhanced.

78.
Financial management and procurement at the federal level and in some states are effective in
ensuring internal control functions. But they could also do more to facilitate efficient, results-oriented
management o f public resources (such as through greater budget reallocation flexibility and more use o f
e-procurement). Efficient financial control and procurement systems could improve the quality o f public
expenditure management, and the government i s considering further modernization o f procurement functions.

79.
Strengthening incentives and capacity for effective policy planning, management, and service
delivery i s also an important objective at the subnational level, where they are often lacking. In addition, a
number o f states are s t i l l grappling with the first-order challenge o f setting their fiscal houses in order.
Carefully designed administrative reforms at the state level would be a necessary condition for substantially improving the efficiency o f spending and the effectiveness o f service delivery. Many municipalities
need to strengthen their fiscal management capacities to comply with the L a w o f Fiscal Responsibility
and to develop arrangements for the provision o f a package o f basic urban services.

80.
Brazil’s public sector institutions and their governance fare well in regional comparisons. Brazil’s bureaucracy i s competent in several key areas. But capacities are uneven across sectors and levels o f
government, and overall public administrations are not geared toward efficiency and results. Cumbersome
bureaucracies are obstacles to efficient social service delivery and a business-friendly investment climate.
As a result, the quality o f governance in Brazil i s still perceived to lag behind that o f OECD countries and
the region’s best performers. Brazil has worked to improve the quality o f policy implementation. Measures such as the National Debureaucratization Program and a variety o f e-government initiatives are intended to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes and make public administration more agile and
predictable. These and other administrative modernization measures should be balanced with the robust
internal control regimes that Brazil has developed to control corruption and other forms o f misuse o f public resources and abuse o f public authority. Through a consultative process, the federal government i s developing a plan for systemic reforms o f the state to upgrade the quality o f public sector institutions and
management.
81.
One o f the most notable changes introduced b y the new government i s a more transparent and
inclusive approach to government decision-making-key to completing Brazil’s transition from a clientelistic to a modem, democratic government. This approach builds on successful local experiences, from
participatory budgeting to involvement o f community associations and local councils in budget and policy
decisions. Through better access to information, the approach can also help build transparency and fight
corruption. It i s now being scaled up at the federal and state levels in a variety o f forms.

82.
The role of the judiciary, particularly in creating juridical security through the fair and transparent application o f laws, i s critical for attracting private investment and guaranteeing citizen rights for all.
There have been recent improvements, for example, in making courts more accessible to the citizenry
through special small claims courts. Despite progress, areas for further improvement remain. Recent analytical work shows l o w efficiency o f the judicial system in resolving conflicts, such as debt collection or
protection from illegal acts by the public sector. The solution appears to lie in simplified procedures and

A More Eauitable. Sustainable. and ComDetitive Brazil - Countrv Assistance Strategv FY2003-2007

20

more proactive case management. Improvements o f the criminal justice system are particularly important,
as evidenced b y l o w conviction rates and the common perception o f areas of impunity.

F. Opportunities and Risks
83.
Given the challenges outlined in the previous sections, Brazil today faces historic opportunities
and risks (Table 5). On the upside, the social commitment o f the new government holds the promise that
inequalities-recognized
as a key obstacle to Brazil’s development progress-will be vigorously addressed. A t the same time, the government’s commitment to maintain and deepen fiscal responsibility and
pursue structural reforms in the face of opposition from entrenched interest groups creates the prospect o f
overcoming chronic economic vulnerability. The new inclusive approach to decision-making could be
crucial to the success of this effort.

Opportunities
Strong economic growth globally could enable Brazil to leverage i t s comparative advantages to attract more foreign direct investment
(and tourism).
Greater economic stability and less vulnerability to extemal shocks could mean investment
grade status for Brazil’s govemment bonds,
reducing the cost of servicing the debt.
Integration of social programs, better targeting
of the poor, and greater efficiency in public
spending could lead to increased equity.
Focus on interactive measures to maintain
fiscal and macro stability along with reforms
in social programs and spending could lead to
a virtuous cycle of growth with equity.
Microeconomic reforms that reduce logistics
costs and strengthen the regulatory framework
could accelerate growth, stimulating economic
expansion.

Greater capacity for management and implementation of environmental policies could
stimulate more sustainable use of natural resources.
A common vision of development, with
strong community and civil society participation in decision-making, could improve the effectiveness of public policies, including those
for reducing crime and violence.
Leveraging the comparative advantages o f
each region could lead to more equalizing
growth, reducing regional disparities.

Risks

Weak economic growth in the region and
globally could leave Brazil more vulnerable to economic instability.
Slippages on macro reforms could lead to
greater extemal vulnerability, increasing
the cost o f debt and worsening the risks
related to public debt stocks.
Disjointed and uncoordinated assistance
programs, assistencialismo, and poor
management o f limited public resources
could prejudice sustained reductions in
poverty and inequality.
Lack of consensus on policy reforms,
stalled policy implementation, or passage
of only weakened versions of reforms
could jeopardize sustained macroeconomic stability and growth.
Lack of microeconomic reforms could
impede faster economic growth.
Without greater capacity for management
and implementation o f environmental
policies, current environmental trends
could worsen, resulting in more environmental degradation.
Without social consensus, reforms may
not be passed and would likely not be as
effective; social progress, crime, and violence could worsen.
Without region-specific strategies that
leverage regional comparative advantages, regional economic and social disparities could widen.

84.
The combination o f macroeconomic discipline, structural reforms, and effective social policies
can lead to a virtuous circle of better quality of life for all over the medium term. Fiscal discipline can
reduce public borrowing requirements, while improvements in the external accounts can allow lower real
interest rates, greater productivity, and higher growth. The approval o f structural reforms and their deep-

ening would ensure the continuity o f fiscal adjustment and permit an improved allocation o f public expenditures. The support this would give to growth and social policies would contribute to a better quality
o f life. Greater well-being would, in turn, help to build further political support for reforms.

85.
Government commitment to economic stability and the reform agenda i s strong. But there remain
considerable risks to the positive scenario described above. Some r i s k s are related to public debt stocks
and external financing requirements that can be reduced only over time and that imply continuing vulnerability to external shocks. Domestic factors include the risks o f weakening political support for reforms
and o f weak policy implementation. Risks to economic stability are interwoven with risks to social progress and growth. If growth and social progress remain slow, political support for sound economic policies and reforms could diminish and undermine market confidence.

86.
The likelihood o f debt sustainability under the current policy stance i s reasonably high,14 and
there i s now a track record that decisive government action can arrest worsening debt to GDP ratios in
cases o f negative shock. Yet, despite strong fiscal efforts, public debt has risen in recent years, underlining the critical importance o f disciplined fiscal policies and persistent efforts to improve the composition
o f the public debt. Negative external shocks, lower than expected growth, or the discovery o f further f i s cal liabilities could interact and would influence the current assessment o f public debt sustainability. In
such a situation, the government would have to restore confidence through appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, as i t has done in the past.
87.
Microeconomic policies to improve the investment climate and productivity are another key
factor. The government sees improving logistics and infrastructure, the regulatory environment, and the
financial sector as a path to higher growth. However, the lack o f fiscal space for critical public investments in infrastructure-a consequence o f the necessary fiscal adjustment-is a constraint. Also, the large
number of entities that need to take action for effective improvements in the investment climate constitutes a risk.
88.
Region-specific factors bring both opportunity and risks. For example, Brazil’s predominantly urban coastal areas represent opportunities for development and technological progress. But worsening crime and violence, among other factors, could scare o f f investment and, with increasing urban
poverty rates, contribute to a deepening urban crisis. Drought in the Northeast and the floods to which the
Southeast i s prone can harm programs and policies there. The already high rates o f deforestation and environmental degradation in the North are projected to worsen under current trends, unless there i s greater
policy commitment. Anticipating, planning, and acting on these fronts would be key to success.

89.
Finally, capacity to implement policies and investments-by government or its partners-is an
added risk. Many ministries o f the new administration are staffed with relative newcomers to government
service. Capacity i s thin and stretched in many areas, calling into question the government’s ability to
implement reforms. Initial experiences suggest challenges in translating ambitious new social programs
into practice, but also reveal a willingness to quickly learn from mistakes and incorporate the lessons o f
experience. Related i s the risk that international institutions, including the World Bank Group, w i l l not
step up to the plate in coordinated, well thought-out, and well-implemented support o f the reform program. Implementation risks also apply to the quality o f the Bank’s portfolio and reduced lending opportunities.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

111. Brazil-World Bank Group Partnership
90.
Brazil’s unique opportunities and risks challenge the Bank Group to pursue a more ambitious
country relationship to achieve greater impact. This CAS continues along previous paths, but i t also embarks on important new ones. Key features o f this four-year CAS (FY2004-2007) are:
A search for the particular opportunities and risks associated with the country’s development strategy,
at the federal and subnational levels, focused on simultaneous efforts to maintain sound macroeconomic management and enhanced social equity.
The beginning o f a results-based approach that emphasizes monitorable outcomes for human welfare, trends in environmental and social sustainability, and indicators o f competitiveness, as well as
fundamental macroeconomic performance, linked to specific activities that the Bank can support to
help achieve these outcomes. This approach w i l l be developed and deepened over time and coupled
with Bank support for results-based management through robust monitoring and evaluation systems
at both federal and subnational levels.

A program to be carried out within a more scaled-up, systemic approach with greater leverage, synergistic partnerships, and a more sectorally integrated view.
A proposal for Bank financial support that, under the right conditions, could be larger under a
higher range base case than in the past. Much of the growth could come in programmatic adjustment
lending and sectorwide approaches (SWAP) at the federal level.
A. Country Assistance Strategy Evaluation and Impact Review

91.
This CAS was developed on the basis o f lessons from implementation of Bank Group assistance over the last decade. I t draws heavily from the Operations Evaluation Department’s (OED’s) recent
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) and the Operation Evaluation Group’s (OEG’ s ) Country Impact
Review (CIR), both covering 1990-2002, and a Completion Report on the FY2000-2003 CAS (Annex 2).
It also incorporates valuable suggestions from the Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE)
discussions o f the CAE and the CIR.
92.
The recent Brazil C A E rates Bank support overall as satisfactory (Box 3, while recognizing
that during this period the Bank became less important as a source o f finance to Brazil. The Bank’s strategy became more selective, focusing on the poor Northeast and on activities to address the roots o f poverty. Education and health were elevated as priority sectors, as was the provision o f basic services and
assets to the poor. The growth element of the strategy involved support to government’s decentralization
and privatization o f infrastructure through technical assistance in regulation and selective lending. Finally,
assistance to the environment expanded significantly in the 1990s, focusing on green issues. From 1999,
adjustment lending constituted a large share o f Bank financial support to Brazil. The CAE concludes that
adjustment lending played an important role in supporting critical reforms, but that social security and
financial sector reforms have not yet gone far e n o u g h 4 l e a r l y indicating challenges for this CAS.
93.
The C A E also highlighted valuable lessons. Among them: The critical role of macroeconomic
stability, particularly the need for continued deepening o f fiscal reforms at both federal and state levels.
The need to continue involvement in the social sectors, where Bank support has been shown to contribute
to an overall strong record o f achievement, but where further progress i s needed: (a) the importance o f a
greater focus on microeconomic reforms to achieve growth, where insufficient progress has been made;

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

23

Box 5. Country Assistance Evaluation Ratings for the Bank’s Three Core Program Areas in Brazil, 1990-

2002

The main component o f Bank support, comprising roughly half o f total lending, was designed to address the
roots of poverty through liuntan resource development and access to basic services. The C A E endorsed the
Bank’s decision for a strong focus on the social sectors, and in particular on the Northeast. The Bank’s program
contributed to positive development outcomes in education (infrastructure, materials, strengthening of state secretariats o f education, minimum operational standards in all schools), health (communicable diseases and health
infrastructure). and the expansion o f basic infrastructure to the poor (rural poverty alleviation projects and projects in water and sanitation and urban transportation). Further focus on education, and in particular secondary
education, would be important in the new CAS.

A second component o f Bank support was designed to stirnulute investnient, economic ejFciency, und growth.
This component produced mixed results. Brazil’s growth rates have surpassed the Latin American average in
recent years, but remain generally disappointing. The Bank’s program strengthened the capacity o f Brazilian
states to manage their own infrastructure, but did not succeed in removing critical bottlenecks that continue to
constrain public and private investment and affect economic performance. Greater attention to growth policies
was cited as a key challenge for the forthcoming CAS.
A third component o f the Bank program, support to the environntent, was found to have produced satisfactory
results. The Bank played a role in the build-up o f institutional capacity in the environment area. from relatively
low levels in the early 1 9 9 0 ~helping the Brazilian government address many critical challenges i n the decade.
The CAE endorsed a continued strong role for the Bank.

(b) continued use o f programmatic adjustment lending as an appropriate instrument for Brazil; (c) better
integration o f Bank strategies across regions and states as well as across sectors to achieve greater development impact; (d) increased monitoring and evaluation o f results and impacts; and (e) more effective
dissemination o f analytical work, which overall was seen as providing a strong positive contribution to
Brazil’s development agenda. These lessons have been widely discussed with government counterparts
and within the Brazil country team and have been incorporated into this new CAS, as described further
below.

94.
The CAS Completion Report (Annex 2) covering FY2000-2003 draws heavily on the CAE and
builds on its findings. I t concludes that the CAS structure and content were consistent with the government program and the country’s long-term goals, although the government placed greater emphasis on
infrastructure than the Bank did during this period. I t further concludes that the Bank program overall
made a satisfactory contribution to Brazil’s development, despite the fact that country progress during the
period fell below initial expectations in some key areas, notably economic growth.

95.
Areas of success were the priorities selected b y the CAS, namely programs for direct poverty
reduction and support for fiscal reforms. In poverty reduction, the Bank’s impact was greatest in health
and education, and less pronounced in social protection. In fiscal reform, the Bank’s impact was greatest
in macroeconomic management and less pronounced in improving the quality o f public expenditures.
Taking into account these lessons, social protection and the quality o f spending are two areas that now
deserve greater emphasis.
96.

Economic and fiscal stability has improved the environment for growth. But despite a wide array
o f investment lending, adjustment lending (financial and energy sectors), and analytical and advisory activities (AAA) pursuing the growth agenda, the Bank’s program had insufficient direct impact on
growth in the period. In particular, vital reforms in the regulatory environment did not progress. This
conclusion has helped orient this CAS, which makes the growth agenda a key priority.

24

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Box 6. Operations Evaluation Group’s Review of the International Finance Corporation’s Program
FY 1990-2002
The mainfindings o f OEG’s Review are that IFC followed relevant and appropriate strategies and adapted them
to changing circumstances, resulting in operations with high additionality; development outcomes were above
the overall I F C average; and the Brazil portfolio’s contribution to IFC’s net profit was positive but lower than
the overall portfolio, due essentially to lower returns on equity investments.
The main recommendations, many already translated into action, include:
Strive for better equity decisions, target yields, and focus onfirst-tier sponsors. W i t h a newly assigned task
team, IFC w i l l continue to improve returns on i t s equity portfolio, which was substantially affected by volatility
in financial markets and depreciation o f the real. IFC supports first-tier sponsors that continue to be unable to
access long-term market finance, in parallel with support to second-tier companies and smaller firms, especially
small and medium-size enterprises and microenterprises.
Bring corporate governance improvements down to the project level, coordinating investment targeting
with advisory work, and work with the Bank OF&policy, especially for private sector development. IFC has been
active in supporting clienthponsor initiatives fostering corporate governance. For example, IFC works with
Bovespa to improve corporate governance practices. Advisory work and collaboration with others in the World
Bank Group are key to IFC’s work-for example, with initiatives to improve the legal and regulatory environment and corporate governance practices in Brazil.
Provide joint policy advisory assistance in the banking sector and develop opportunities with financial
institutions. IFC i s closely coordinating with the Bank on programmatic financial sector loans and work on improving competitiveness.

97.
In the remaining two pillars o f the FY2000-2003 CAS, governance and environmental management, progress has been more mixed. On governance, the Bank program has been relatively cautious and selective, and the Bank’s contribution slight. On environmental management, country progress
has been modest, but the Bank has had a catalytic role, mainly in donor-funded initiatives like the Pilot
Program to Conserve the Rain Forest ( W P ) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which have
generated successes. These demonstration efforts could be scaled up.
98.
Increased strategic focus on the Northeast and on relationships with the states has paid dividends, as has continued acknowledgement o f the central role o f fiscal management in Brazil today. Improving analysis of public spending, strengthening the microeconomic environment for growth, and
building institutions to tackle exclusion, violence, and environmental protection are some o f the key challenges for the next CAS period.
99.
OEG’s review of IFC’s operations in Brazil during FY 1990-2002 noted that Brazil was consistently among IFC’s largest country portfolios and that approvals expanded 15-fold during the review period. Brazil’s macroeconomic environment and attractiveness to foreign financiers were volatile throughout these years, requiring that IFC adjust flexibly to the rapidly evolving environment, country needs, and
opportunities (Box 6).

B. Program Implementation Progress
100. The Bank has a large ongoing portfolio in Brazil (fourth in size Bankwide) with 54 active projects and US$4.9 billion in commitments at the end o f FY2003 (Table 6), along with more than 20 grants.
About half the portfolio supports federal programs (though many are implemented at the state or local
level) and about half supports programs in Brazil’s states. With this large program, the Bank i s present in

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

25

virtually every state in Brazil. The portfolio i s broadly matched to the government’s development priorities. While just four projects are currently in “problem” status, 12 projects carry the slow disbursement
flag, and the Brazil management team has decided to create a “watch l i s t ” o f 20 projects (nearly half the
portfolio) that suffer from chronically inadequate budgetary resources for timely implementation. In the
absence o f improvements in implementation and disbursements, the number o f problem projects could
increase significantly.

101. Lack o f budget (and in some cases counterpart funds) i s due primarily to the effects o f Brazil’s
ambitious fiscal adjustment program. Fiscal measures since the late 1990s, while necessary and positive
overall, have resulted in substantially reduced fiscal space for public investments. Recent budget cuts
to meet primary surplus targets combined with constitutionally mandated earmarking o f expenditures
leave little room for discretionary investment spending. Moreover, since 1999, projects financed with
loans from international financial institutions, previously considered additional to the budget, have effectively been treated as regular budget expenditure items, subject to overall fiscal targets and constraints.
These necessary and healthy measures have led to reduced budgets for investment projects funded by international financial institutions. And at the state level, implementation o f fiscal discipline through the
rules consolidated in the Fiscal Responsibility Law has had a similar effect. The upshot o f a l l this has
been a slowing o f the rate of investment lending disbursements, which fell b y more than half from
FY 1999 to FY2003 (see Table 6).

102.
In addition, devaluations over the last several years have translated into larger dollar-denominated
loan balances than needed to cover costs determined at appraisal. This i s reflected in the large undisbursed amount o f US$2.7 billion. The Bank has been working closely with the government to address
these issues, including through a recent Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) held jointly with
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which faces the same set o f implementation challenges.
Among the avenues proposed are a plan for partial cancellations o f loan balances, with agreement in principle on canceling a significant share o f the undisbursed amount; close cooperation with Planning and
Finance Ministries in the context o f the PPA to improve alignment o f projects with budgetary priorities
and to better forecast project budget needs; and expanded policy dialogue on relaxing federal government
budget execution rigidities identified in the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA).
103. For the same fiscal reasons, new conventional investment lending has become increasingly
difficult, and the Bank has not been able to commit resources commensurate with Brazil’s financial
needs. This i s reflected in longer lead-times from appraisal to Board, in particular for subnational borrowers. I t i s also reflected in slowing investment lending commitments in the FY2000-03 CAS period
(averaging just US$450 million annually over the four years, compared with the US$1 billion that would

26

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

aging just US$450 million annually over the four years, compared with the US$1 billion that would have
been available under the CAS). The Bank and the government have jointly been exploring ways to
streamline the subnational approval process, in particular though agreement on criteria for state borrowing
(see paragraph 138) and up-front agreement on annual programs consistent with these criteria, discussed
during the planned semi-annual reviews.
104.
Recent Bank and partner diagnostic work indicates that Brazil has a strong institutional framework for implementation at the national level. The 2002 C F A A rated the country’s financial accountability systems and institutions as well-designed and reliable in tracking budget expenditures, with a high
degree o f transparency. While effective in ensuring aggregate fiscal control, more work i s needed in modernizing these systems to better reflect priorities. Brazil i s piloting the Bank’s new Financial Management
Strategy (FMS) instrument, which explores ways to make financial institutions more central to program
delivery (such as through simplified financial management arrangements for individual projects, processes that contribute to country capacity as well as meeting the Bank’s internal needs, and opportunities
for harmonization with other partners). F M S preparation has already helped to develop approaches for
addressing operational constraints arising from fiscal adjustment and budget rigidities. An ongoing state
Financial Accountability Assessment (covering the states o f Bahia, Cearh, and Pernambuco) i s finding
sound systems but strong need for capacity building at the local level.

105. The Bank has also recently discussed and agreed with the federal government on the Country
Procurement Assessment (CPAR), which rated federal procurement systems and institutions as satisfactory and among the strongest in the region. An action plan o f future work includes establishing a normative agency and making better use o f innovative e-procurement. State procurement assessments are also
completed or under way in Bahia, Cearh, and Pernambuco, and have similarly found strong institutions
and legislation but capacity in need o f strengthening. Already-strong financial management and procurement systems would be further developed in the context of public sector management policy and operational work, including joint Public Expenditure Reviews and related technical assistance, which could be
oriented to the subnational level. This sound fiduciary framework forms a firm foundation for moving
forward with a program o f sectorwide approach projects (SWAP), primarily at the federal level but perhaps in certain states as well.
106. Over the past two years, the country team has also worked closely with the World Bank Institute
(WBI) to more fully integrate WBI’s learning, capacity enhancement, and knowledge dissemination
activities with the Bank’s lending and AAA work. As a result, WBI’s activities-in particular in education, health, decentralization and municipal development, urban management, anti-comption and transparency, poverty, and rural development in the Northeast-directly support operational work. Many o f
these activities have been developed and implemented in partnership with Brazilian institutions. The establishment o f three Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) centers in Brazil has been a key element
in the progressive integration o f operations and knowledge into a more seamless effort.

107. Brazil represents IFC’s largest country portfolio. As o f August 31, 2003, IFC had outstanding
committed investments in 80 companies in Brazil, with a total exposure o f US$2.7 billion, US$1.5 billion
o f i t for i t s own account and US$1.2 billion for participants’ account. IFC’s portfolio in Brazil i s well diversified in a wide range o f sectors, including finance, chemicals and petrochemicals, manufacturing,
mining, infrastructure, food and agribusiness, and services (including information, health, education). The
IFC Brazil portfolio in general remains o f high quality despite the difficulties Brazil has experienced over
the last three years. Throughout the last CAS period IFC’s activity was consistent with the country
strategy. Following the priorities set out in the CAS and in the subsequent CAS Progress Reports, strategic priorities included backing companies that would generate growth, supporting activities that demon-

strate tangible benefits o f liberalization, and investing in the financial sector to improve prospects for sustained growth. Table 7 shows approvals over the last CAS period.

Example of IFC’s Quick Response

A t a time o f global risk aversion, pullback o f bank lines to Brazil, and severe
market illiquidity in the country. access to trade financing became a serious
constraint in 2001-02. IFC was approached b y the four major Brazilian financial institutions (Unibanco, Itau: BBA, and Bradesco) requesting support for
trade finance. IFC responded positively and swiftly and in FY2003 committed
US$620 million (US$110 million o f A-loans and US$510 inillion from participating banks) in trade finance facilities with those institutions, including
c,onversion o f two existing credit lines for project finance, finance (Unibanco
and Itau). The operation proved to be an effective way o f making committed
funds available more rapidly for an alternate, priority use.

oped non-investment activities in areas where i t s technical expertise, advice, and grant financing window were highly valued. Non-investment operations included support to corporate governance improvement (BovespaNovo Mercado), a program to combat
HIV/AIDS with Odebrecht in Brazil and Angola, small and medium-size enterprises, environmentally and
socially sustainable business in Minas Gerais, privatization advisory services in Pernambuco, Fome Zero
(Ethos and Polis, linking municipalities and private companies), a carbon trading facility project in Minas
Gerais, and POEMA (poverty and environment in the Amazon).
C. Consultations and Outreach

110. With the new government’s focus on participation, the Bank has substantially expanded i t s outreach with civil society groups (Box 8). Thus, in addition to consultations with federal government ministries and representatives o f virtually all state governments, the country team has consulted with youth
groups, environmental and other NGOs, trade unions, the media, and private sector and religious groups.
Special consultations were held with the Social and Economic Development Council (CDES), an advi-

28

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

sory council established b y the government to give greater voice to all groups in society in discussions o f
key reform priorities. The Bank sponsored an Innovation Day and i s seeking out the voices o f less wellrepresented groups, such as the quilombolas (Afro-descendants living in remote communities) and indigenous groups. The feedback from consultations has been shared with the government (whose representatives participated in some of the events) and throughout the country team, and has been reflected in the
design of the program.

111. Current projects are also a source o f ongoing consultation and feedback. An important share o f
the Bank’s portfolio o f active projects i s carried out in close partnership with c i v i l society organizations.
For example, the nine ongoing Northeast state Rural Poverty Reduction Projects (PCPRs) use a community-driven approach in which local associations decide on the most pressing investment needs, finance
the investments, and contract for their execution. These associations ensure simple and measurable poverty targeting, transparency, and dissemination o f best practice among community members. Active participation o f local communities i s a key element in the selection and design o f protected areas in the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) project. This participatory approach, which also includes cooperation with Brazilian NGOs and scientific and academic institutions, i s contributing to decentralization o f
environmental management and to encouragement o f private sector funding for protected area management. The Pilot Program to Conserve the Rain Forest provides financial and technical support to two national N G O networks (the Amazon Working Group and the Atlantic Rainforest Network) that represent
over 800 c i v i l society organizations.
112.
C A S consultations broadly endorsed the direction o f the proposed C A S and program, but
also brought to light a number o f new ideas, allowing the program to be much more reflective o f Brazil’s
priorities. One emphasis was on taking advantage of opportunities relating to Brazil’s true wealth through
greater attention to education, entrepreneurship, culture, and natural resources. In line with the PPA vision
for a more sustainable Brazil, concerns were raised related to the sustainability implications o f some PPA
infrastructure investments. Consultations also emphasized emerging issues-including culture, crime and
violence, youth as well as stronger implementation o f the sustainability agenda-issues on which the
country team might not otherwise have focused as much.
113.
The enthusiastic response to consultations made i t clear that an ongoing participatory process of
consultation, including the eventual development of a learning forum or development network, was not
only in demand within civil society but would also strengthen the program and i t s responsiveness to
Brazil’s needs. The Bank i s building this ongoing consultative process in coordination with the CDES,
key c i v i l society networks, and with other interested international and domestic partners, including youth
movements, and expects to take advantage o f GDLN and web-based networks.

D. Development Partners
114.
While external assistance i s small relative to the size o f Brazil’s economy, external financial
flows, and government spending, coordination among international development partners i s nevertheless important to take advantage o f synergies that can increase impact. Through the CAS consultation
process the Bank has strengthened i t s cooperation with these partners, oriented toward the objectives of
the PPA and the Millennium Development Goals and the role o f each partner in helping Brazil reach
these and other goals. The Bank coordinates a quarterly meeting o f international partners to discuss Brazil’s development challenges.
115.
Since 1998, Brazil has successfully implemented three IMF programs and received considerable
financial support from the IMF. Performance under the current US$30 billion Stand-by Arrangement, due
to be completed by end 2003, has been good. A new one-year precautionary IMF program i s likely to be

Box 8, Highlights from C A S Consultations
Views from civil society. The vision of a more just, competitive, and sustainable Brazil was well received during the consultations, an important confirmation o f the goals. The following groups added to that vision:

Social and Econoinic Developmerit Council (CDES): Among additional priorities should be investing i n
university education to improve the climate for innovation, building on cultural assets as a key factor in development outcomes, reducing crime and violence. improving monitoring and evaluation o f public programs, and ensuring ongoing consultations between donors and organized civil society on their programs.
Civil Society Networks and NGO Representatives: The process o f consultation would benefit from joint
discussions with the Bank and the government periodically. The Bank could play a helpful role in supporting the mainstreaming o f social, environmental and cultural concerns into development plans and programs
North and Northeast NGOs: The main areas o f focus were access to land and the need for irrigation and for
greater agricultural productivity. Municipal and state governments need to invest in upgrading their institutional and administrative capacities.
Academics and Parliamentarians: The new government i s doing well with macroeconomic policies for
stabilization, but microeconomic reforms to remove distortions and logistical constraints and to strengthen
the regulatory environment are also needed.
International community: International financial assistance plays a relatively small role in Brazil. More
important i s the knowledge and experience that the international community can share. Members o f the international community should meet to discuss their assistance programs and improve coordination.
Youth: Key are education, support to businesses and enterprises started by youth, and community programs
to reduce violence. Also important are strengthening the morals and values o f the nation‘s youth, supporting
their creativity and idealism, and taking advantage o f the “anything i s possible“ spirit to stiinulate innovation.
Views f r o m the private sector. The joint Bank-IFC mission for private sector consultations highlighted these
views from the private sector:
1

On the macroeconomic side, the private sector expressed satisfaction with the authorities’ ability to handle
macroeconomic issues, but i s concerned about the lack o f economic growth. They perceive microeconomic
issues as a key obstacle to growth, notably institutional transitions. Key state institutions are still sending
some mixed signals to the private sector due to the political transition, creating uncertainty for investment
decisions.
A shortage of long-term financing - State banks (BNDES and others) and niultilitterals (IFC, IDB) remain
the only sources o f long-term financing.
Interest rates are still too high to support capital formation.
High logistics costs (ports, roads, rail), a key component of “Custo Brazil” are particularly detrimental to
exports.
Energy - The current regulatory framework creates uncertainty. discouraging the private investments necessary to meet future demand for energy, especially in the event of higher economic growth. There i s no longterm financing in the energy sector.
Brazil’s investment climate suffers from weaknesses in the administrative, regulatory, legal, and judicial
frameworks, an inipediment to productive private sector activities, discouraging entrepreneurship and reduction of informality.

agreed soon. The Bank and the IMF are coordinating closely and are in agreement on the basic parameters
o f Brazil’s macroeconomic program and performance. Bank adjustment lending and the linked technical
assistance have helped to deepen progress in areas that are also central to the IMF program, such as debt
and expenditure management. The recently completed Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was
a highlight o f Bank-IMF collaboration.

116. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has a large program in Brazil, with annual
commitments similar in volume to the Bank’s, at about US$1.5 billion. Since most o f these commitments

30

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

are in investment loans, which are slowly disbursing because o f fiscal factors discussed above (paragraph
113), IDB’s portfolio o f US$10 billion in ongoing commitments i s substantially larger than the Bank’s
investment lending portfolio, which faces s i m i l a r issues. The two programs are highly matched in terms
o f objectives, with a focus on social development, environment, growth and infrastructure, and good governance. But within broadly aligned programs, there are different areas o f strength and emphasis. Examples are the Bank’s relative focus on basic education compared with IDB’s focus on secondary and higher
education, and the Banks emphasis on rural areas compared with the IDB’s stronger urban portfolio.
117.
Because IDB i s an important partner for both Brazil and the Bank, the country team has recently
built a more formal collaborative relationship. Several working groups w i l l be examining ways for the
two development banks, building on their comparative advantages, to share knowledge and experience
and better serve Brazil’s interests. Among the areas to be examined are analytical work on the fiscal situation o f Brazil’s states; joint development of a municipal strategy to guide lending to Brazil’s local governments; harmonization o f financial management, procurement, and other policies; and analytical work
on attracting private sector investment in infrastructure. At the state level, the Bank i s coordinating with
IDB and other partners through state assistance strategies, which dovetail with IDB’ s ambitious program
of capacity building at the local level. The two institutions may also explore collaboration on sectorwide
approaches (SWAPS).
118. Partnerships with UNDP, other UN agencies, and numerous bilateral agencies are fruitful.
Among other areas, UNDP’s program focuses on monitoring and measurement o f the Human Development Index, and on tracking and monitoring the Millennium Development Goals, for which UNDP i s the
lead agency. The Bank i s working closely with bilateral agencies, including G-7 governments, on the Pilot Program to Conserve the Rain Forest. I t i s also working with the Cities Alliance, a global partnership,
and with the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) trust fund. Some bilateral agencies adopted explicit strategies of complementarity with the Bank. Several thematic working groups have
also been formed among Brazil’s external partners, such as that on the Millennium Development Goals.

E. World Bank Group Comparative Advantage and Focus
119. The Bank has specific areas of focus o r comparative advantage relative to i t s international
partners. The first i s i t s knowledge contributions, based on i t s global experience, and the link to policy
dialogue. The second i s i t s ability to strengthen institutional capacity, including through WBI activities.
The third i s competitive financing and innovative lending products. The fourth i s the ability to catalyze
through i t s projects the efficient spending o f others, including the government.
120. The Bank’s financing remains relevant as a low-cost source for meeting a part of Brazil’s gross
external financing requirements o f US$40-50 billion annually. However, the true value o f Bank lending comes to bear when i t s resources support policies, programs, or projects that imply a better quality o f
public spending, including policy improvements and reforms that reach well beyond the specific investments financed with Bank loans. Even more important i s how Bank lending can leverage other financial
sources. To fulfill these roles, the Bank needs to continue a broad range o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA) and to select projects for support that can achieve leverage and systemic impact beyond their
positive direct results.
121. IFC, IDB, and Brazil’s public banks are the only significant sources of medium and longterm finance for the private sector in Brazil. According to the OEG report and consultations with the
private sector, IFC’s additionality has been greater than financing amounts would indicate, ranging from
sharing technical and financial structuring expertise to encouraging good social and environmental practices. IFC’ s additionality was also strong through i t s B-loan mobilization and advisory assistance. With

A M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

31

more than 40 years of experience in Brazil and a highly diversified portfolio demonstrating multisectoral
expertise (including such difficult sectors as private infrastructure, capital market development, private
health care, and education), the IFC i s a long-term partner o f the Brazilian private sector. IFC’s actions
and presence during the crises of the past four years strongly demonstrated the additionality o f IFC products and expertise in middle-income income countries such as Brazil. The ability to react quickly in countercyclical fashion in times o f crisis has been valued b y both IFC clients and the Brazilian authorities.
122.
The private sector consultation confirmed that IFC’s service i s valued not only for long-term
financing but also for dissemination o f best practices in environmental, social, and corporate govemance practices; corporate and financial restructuring; and privatization advice, notably in infrastructure.
The OEG report found IFC to be relatively more responsive and with more global expertise than comparator institutions. IFC’s credit lines have had important catalytic effects on international financial markets, which follow IFC’ s interventions in emerging markets, as demonstrated b y the recent trade finance
facilities in Brazil (Box 7).
123.
Similarly, MIGA’s comparative advantage i s i t s ability to enhance and scale up private sector
investment through i t s political risk guarantees, thereby facilitating additional foreign investment and
lending in Brazil.
124.
The Bank’s focus in this CAS i s on areas o f high likely impact on development results and on
potential for scaling up. Because of large needs and the strong relationship with the government, demand for Bank technical, institutional, and knowledge support far exceeds the capacity to deliver. Demand for financial support i s affected b y limited fiscal space, but i s s t i l l potentially large compared with
the Bank’s financing capacity. Priority w i l l go to activities that most directly and efficiently support Brazil’s development goals in key thematic areas and to activities that have a scale impact (because they are
replicable or because they lead to the scaling up o f effective activities). For direct intervention in the private sector, through financial support and knowledge transfer, the Bank Group’s primary choice o f instruments remains IFC’s investment and noninvestment activities and MIGA’s political risk guarantees
for foreign investors.

In selecting activities for Bank support, therefore, the following principles apply:

The Bank w i l l support activities with critical importance for achieving development results and
addressing the policy challenges identified in this CAS.
Activities supported by the Bank w i l l either contribute directly to policy reforms needed to
achieve the desired results (mostly at the national level), or help to implement projects that bring
direct development results, have catalytic impacts, and are replicable and scalable (mostly at the
subnational level). They w i l l thus have a strategic impact that reaches well beyond direct project
benefits.
Bank-supported activities w i l l demonstrate ownership and commitment o f the implementing
government, as expressed, for example, in the budget and prioritization o f the PPA at the federal
level or equivalent planning exercise at the state or local level.
The Bank Group w i l l support activities that draw on i t s comparative advantage and add value to
the work of other development partners. I t w i l l choose the most appropriate combination o f instruments to achieve the desired development result, including IBRD lending, AAA, capacity
building, learning and knowledge dissemination, and IFC and MIGA support.

126. For the Bank, the CAS proposes programmatic selectivity, defined b y an intervention’s relevance to the country’s longer term goals rather than to more limited sectoral objectives. Rather than isolated one-off interventions, programmatic selectivity aims at supporting a group o f actions across sectors
that contribute to a core development objective over the medium term. The approach i s systemic, relying
on priority government programs and institutions and moving away from the use o f Bank-driven agencies, procedures, and reporting requirements. I t i s integrated, accounting for intersectoral linkages and
moving away from free-standing, single-sector projects. It i s leveraged, seeking to catalyze efficient use
o f other (including government) resources and moving away from projects that do not mobilize other actors. Finally, i t i s results-oriented, focusing on projects that can demonstrate a measurable contribution
to defined development outcomes and moving away from projects that cannot.
127. While this means that the CAS encompasses activities in a large number o f areas and sectors,
these areas are interlinked and identified as critical for achieving the desired development outcomes. And
many public policy areas in which the Bank has no particular comparative advantage are left out. In addition, the areas selected for Bank support are prioritized according to the Bank’s comparative advantage, so that in some cases the perceived urgency differs from that o f the country, as illustrated in Table 8.

F. The CAS Results Framework
128. The emerging results framework for the Bank Group’s CAS i s discussed in the follow sections (see also the attached matrix in Annex 9, and results monitoring framework in Annex 10). The approach, to be implemented and refined over time, was constructed on the basis o f the longer term vision
and goals (see Table 4) and the more near-term development plans, outlined above. The results framework defines medium-term country outcomes toward these goals and the CAS-supported actions to

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

33

achieve them. Progress toward the medium-term outcomes-to which the government and all i t s partners,
including the Bank Group, contribute-should be achievable within the CAS period and capable o f being
monitored using intermediate indicators. The results framework further defines planned Bank activities to
contribute towards specific intermediate outcomes during the CAS implementation period. Tables 9-12
summarize the main elements o f the results framework for each CAS area. Finally, performance indicators for the CAS lending cases are derived from this results framework (Table 14). Progress within the
framework would be reviewed during the proposed semi-annual joint policy reviews between the government and the Bank’s country team.
129. As part o f this effort, the Bank would assist governments at the federal and subnational levels to
strengthen their frameworks for better results-based management and budgeting and performance
accountability by developing new financing incentives, information systems, and human capacity. This
w i l l imply greater use o f results-based contracts, definition o f performance measures, and establishment
o f robust monitoring and evaluation systems and capacities. The Bank would support these efforts
through targeted technical assistance, piloting use o f performance-linked financing (through SWAps and
other instruments), and joint analytical work. Key Bank instruments to support results monitoring include
a multiyear joint Public Expenditure Review focused on improved results-based budgeting, technical assistance to strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems for social programs, and technical assistance
and AAA to states to strengthen their ability to achieve specific development objectives. These are ambitious public sector management reforms, and though they w i l l take some time to implement, they w i l l
make possible a deepening o f the results-based framework initiated in this CAS.
G. Instruments of the Bank Group Program

130.
The Bank Group’s aim i s to maximize the value i t brings to i t s client institutions-Brazilian governments and companies-through lending and advice. One of the most critical operational barrier to
financial support i s the reduced budget space for new and existing investments because of Brazil’s
necessary pursuit of fiscal discipline and its budget rigidity. At the same time, despite recent improvements in the current account, Brazil’s external financing needs are s t i l l pressing. With Brazil’s responsible macro management and fiscal performance and sound institutional and fiduciary framework,
there i s substantial scope for Bank support. The key challenge i s to choose the right instruments for making funding available. This means drawing on emerging thinking on the spectrum o f Bank lending products (expanded use o f SWAps, pooling and performance-focused approaches) to ensure the greatest responsiveness o f Bank programs to Brazil’s current constraints. I t also means working closely with the
government through policy dialogue to minimize the impact o f these constraints, where that i s possible
(for example, b y reducing budget execution rigidities).
13 1. In close consultation with the federal and state governments, the Bank has re-oriented i t s support
to focus on four core groups of activities. First, to meet the need for balance of payments financing and
support for reforms, the Bank expects to continue policy-based programmatic adjustment lending
(Box 9). Programmatic adjustment lending at the federal level, complemented b y technical assistance
loans, would support the policy framework in the thematic and foundation areas o f the CAS. Some programmatic loans would be broad in scope (for example, covering fiscal reforms ranging from macrofiscal balance and structural reforms to public expenditure and public sector management issues). Realistically, progress w i l l not be even across the entire program. Individual loans, therefore, would often support a critical mass o f reform actions achieved in only some o f the areas covered b y the program. Semiannual joint reviews b y the country team and government would assess policy progress in key areas and
plan the next phases o f the support program. The Bank aims to keep policy-based lending at an upper
bound o f 50 percent o f the CAS lending ceiling over the CAS period.

34

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Box 9. Enhancing the Use of Innovative Lending Instrunients
Policy-based (or adjustment) lending aims to galvanke and support policy reforms. Experience shows that programmatic adjustment lending, which shifts the emphasis to lending in response to reform5 already enacted
rather than conditioning loan disbursements on predefined government actions, increases countries’ commitment
to reforms. Brazil‘s external vulnerability makes the flexibility o f programmatic lending especially advantageous. Given the Bank’s small financial role, such programs require a strong lead from the government. Brazil
has so far established three progranmiatic policy-based lending programs supported b y the Bank: fiscal reform,
financial-sector reform. and human development. Two loans have been made under each of the first two programs and one under the third. A new proposed program to support growth and competitiveness policies would
include financial sector policies. A new program to support sustainable development and natural resource management i s also proposed. This approach would lead to one broad program o f policy based lending in each o f the
CAS thematic areas and the foundations area.

Like programmatic adjustment lending, pooled sectorwide approach (SWAP) investment lending aims to increase commitment, impact, and flexibility. Traditional investment loans disburse against specific spending
categories and impose Bank procurement arid reporting requirements. In countries such as Brazil, with relatively
strong financial management and procurement institutions and capabilities at the federal level, pooled funding
gives more flexibility to investment lending. Bank resources are pooled with government funds and disbursed
from the same account. Pooling opens the possibility of tying financing to results, so this approach i s most effective i f linked to a robust results framework. Increasingly, acute spending restrictions have made this option more
attractive to Brazil and the Bank, as a way o f ensuring the smooth functioning o f projects through financially
difticult periods.
In the context o f the Brazil CAS’s greater focus on programmatic approaches and leveraging 0 existing country
systems, Bank loan disbursement arrangements that take borrower performance into account are being explored and could be piloted. Several models are being considered, among them, Bank financing linked to outputs
(e.g., number of diplomas or number o f electricity connections), Bank financing linked to midterm measures of
benchmarked performance, and variable Bank financing depending on targeting and monitoring systems improvements. The models build upon and exceed the performance arrangements incorporated into the Brazil
Family Health Extension Project, but would ultimately recognize the need to base investment lending disbursements on actual expenditures so as to meet Bank Articles requirements.

Through financial guarantees the World Bank Group insures private sector investments against ceztain events.
Partial risk guarantees are suitable for large-scale operations i n which government performance or regulation i s a
significant factor in the project’s attractiveness to the private sector. Partial risk guarantees seem to be wellsuited to Brazil’s needs since in certain sectors (water, energy, roads) investors have cited perceived instabilities
in the regulatory, legal, and judicial environments as a reason for holding back. The Bank Group intends to explore the possible use of guarantees to foster public-private partnerships, in particulax for infrastructure provision
nnrl mnintPnnncr

132. Second, to increase the systemic benefits o f Bank support, sectorwide approaches (SWAps)
would become a key investment lending modality, especially at the national level. SWAps rely on ministries and other government institutions that are already in place rather than on special-purpose project implementation units, and they use existing country fiduciary rules assessed as sound through diagnostic
work at the national level (paragraph 105). They also allow the Bank to support existing government programs o f high priority rather than individual projects or transactions. Considering Brazil’s limited fiscal
space, this latter feature makes SWAps a potentially more effective lending instrument than traditional
investment lending in many cases. Through both SWAps and traditional investment lending the Bank
would seek to pilot output-based and performance-linked approaches (Box 9).

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

35

133. A joint government-Bank working group has reviewed the government expenditure program as
set out in the federal Multiyear Plan (PPA) and defined a first group of priority programs for Bank
support through SWAps for FY2004-05. The Bank i s also working with the govemment to identify further SWAP possibilities through the planned joint Public Expenditure Review at the federal level. Similar
exercises are planned at the state level, and state-level SWAps are also under consideration. The systemic
benefits of SWAps would be bolstered through technical assistance components and well-integrated programs of learning, capacity building, and knowledge dissemination, including by the WBI.
134.
With a stronger emphasis on SWAps, a strategy for strengthening Brazil’s already strong
country procurement and financial management systems assumes greater priority. Elements o f such a
further diagnostic work at the subnational level, through
strategy for this CAS period would include: (i)
additional procurement and financial accountability assessments in a group o f states and selected municipiloting the Financial
palities (consistent with our evolving strategies for support to these clients); (ii)
Management Strategy instrument as a means to develop and agree on an action plan based on the conclusector work in procurement; as a vehicle for dialogue on continued
sions o f the recent CFAA; and (iii)
reforms recommended in the CPAR. In addition, fiduciary strengthening would be mainstreamed into the
public sector management policy dialogue, through the Public Expenditure Review and perhaps through
technical assistance and adjustment support as well, in the context o f public expenditure management reform. Development o f a new safeguards assessment tool could help bring knowledge o f the safeguard
systems to the same level as fiduciary knowledge and provide a platform for capacity and institution
building. Continued progress on program harmonization with the IDB would also be important for further
strengthening Brazil’s systems.
135. As in the fiduciary area, the Bank intends to work increasingly with national institutions and
policy frameworks for environmental assessment, management, and conservation and for social
assessment (including policies on indigenous people, Afro-descendants, and resettlement). The legislation in many o f these areas i s comparatively robust, and the institutions have sound technical capacity and
information databases. The Bank would undertake a review o f the federal and (as needed) state social and
environmental assessment frameworks (through a proposed “Safeguards Assessment”), to suggest areas
for further strengthening. In the case o f discrepancies between Brazilian and Bank policies, Bank policies
would apply. In the interim, the Bank would consider pilot approaches using the country’s environmental
and social assessment framework, which could play a key role in meeting the environmental and social
assessment needs o f Bank operations.
136. Third, building on progress over the last year, the Bank w i l l continue i t s ongoing relationship
with subnational governments, working in a more coordinated and integrated fashion in the states and
municipalities where i t i s already active. Going forward, the Bank w i l l selectively lend to creditworthy
states, using traditional investment lending, SWAps, and other instruments as appropriate. In the past
year, the formation o f Bank “state teams” led by a state team coordinator (usually a task manager with a
project in the state) and the development o f state assistance strategies have helped to integrate activities
and thus to enhance the impact in individual states (Box 10). State strategies, based on intensive dialogue
with the state’s economic team on development priorities and goals, focus on the full array o f challenges
and include policy reviews, public expenditure and other economic analysis, and fiduciary reviews and
related capacity building, as well as other partners’ activities in the state.
137. The operational support to states would build in cross-sectoral interconnectivity in a variety o f
ways, depending on the state. In smaller states the Bank would likely support one integrated project to
address a number of state development priorities. In larger states, the Bank could continue with one or
more predominantly sectorally based operations, while coordinating their impacts through the state strategy and the state team.

Box 10. The Bank’s Increasing Focus on Integrated State Programs
Ceara. In an exercise coined “Accelerating Results ‘Together.” Bank and state staff collaborated to establish
ways to reduce infant mortality, improve the quality o f education. and increase employment and income, especially among youth, the state’s three goals. The state has since implemented specific actions. One reason for
success was that the government took ownership for its recommendations.
Marunltuo. The State Economic Memorandum for Maranhao points to four areas o f priority: education, governance, land (tenure and zoning). and infrastructure. The Bank has integrated i t s support for these objectives by
linking the Rural Poverty Reduction Project to these areas o f priorities and to the broader state development
strategy. The state has also been keen to implement evaluation o f its public programs to feed the government
decisionmaking process.

Buhiu. The Bank program in Bahia encompasses fiive operations, with commitments of more than US$425 million. Adding federal programs being implemented in the state to the total brings commitments to some US$500
million. State and Bank staff have developed an integrated, cross-sectoral assistance program focusing on two
key priorities: water resource inanageinent and poverty alleviation i n rural areas, and the capacity o f urban areas
to handle population growth through urban upgrading, including slum upgrading and the provision o f local infrastructure and social services.
Peritambucu. In a joint exercise the state and the Bank identified four development priorities: promoting social
inclusion of at-risk youth, stimulating small and medium-scale productive activities. improving living conditions
in poor urban neighborhoods, and strengthening governance and management. To support these priorities, the
Bank recently prepared an integrated urban development project for the metropolitan region o f Recife (FY2003)
and i s finalizing preparation of an Integrated Development Project (FY2004) that supports quality enhancement
in education service delivery and broader reform o f the state. I n collaboration with UK Department for International Development, the Bank team has also provided financial and analytical support for preparation o f the
state’s Multiyear plan. IFC provided advisory support to involve the private sector i n key municipal services
(Recife Metro, Copergar, and BR232. toll road).

Minus Gerais. The state and Bank recently developed a joint strategy for collaboration. While the state’s d
cult fiscal situation constrains lending, the Bank i s exploring innovative ways o f supporting the state’s focus on
fiscal austerity and better public sector management, greater private sector participation to enhance growth, and
the overall goal o f improved equity. LFC i s supporting corporate responsibility among private companies in Minas Gerais through a partnership with the Federation o f Industries o f the State o f Minas Gerais (FIEMG) and
VoluntBrios das Gerais (a key local volunteer action group), involving 50 companies in an initial stage.

138.
With demand for Bank support strong from virtually all states, an additional filter o f state selectivity criteria will help define the subnational program and ensure that lending to states does not conflict with the government’s overall fiscal targets. Two criteria are particularly critical. First, the Bank w i l l
lend to states whose fiscal situation i s consistent with the rules established in the Fiscal Responsibility
Law and agreements with the federal government. Second, Bank lending must fit within state fiscal targets, with funded projects adequately budgeted, to ensure aggregate fiscal balance. Additional criteria
would be poverty and social need (a l o w Human Development Index), a demonstrated commitment to
reforms, and an integrated approach directed at results. Finally, in selecting programs, the Bank w i l l consider institutional capacity, in particular in the design o f projects and mix o f instruments. The state lending program would be discussed in the context o f the planned semi-annual review.15
l5 In this context, the CAS program reflects b y name only those state and municipal projects that have been approved for preparation by Brazil’s inter-ministerial commission (COFIEX). Other possible state and municipal projects are indicated without reference to specific state or municipal names. The agreed lending program w i l l be revised and updated every six months, based on new COFIEX approvals.

Box 11. Toward a M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Northeast

The Northeast i s home to 29 percent of Brazil‘s population and 53 percent of i t s poor (25 nlillion people below
the poverty line). Through continuous rural-to-urban migration. the Northeast’s predominantly rural poverty also
reinforces the number of poor in such urban areas outside the Northeast as Silo Paulo, R i a and Brasilia. Social
indicators are also less favorable in the Northeast than elsewhere: per capita income i s barely half of Brxzil‘s; the
average worker has 4.5 years of schooling compared with 6.3 for Brazil: infant mortality rates are over 53 deaths
per 1,000 live births compared with 30 for Brazil. Tntraregional inequality i s an even more serious challenge,
with great variation among states and cities. Finally, while agriculture accounts for only 9 percent of regional
GDP i t employs 36 percent of the workforce. The large numbers of low-productivity rural workers and sinall
farmers contribute greatly to the poverty count in the region and in Brazil overall.

The strategy for the Northeast envisions a more equitable, sustainable, and competitive future that requires addressing the pernianence of deep poverty and social and economic inequality within the Northeast and compared
with the rest of Brazil.
Social sustainability (a more equitable Brazil). From a long-term perspective, development depends on education. Lack of education i s closely associated with poverty and inequality. Priorities include early childhood education, universal provision of high-quality priniary and secondary education, and capacity building at various
levels. Also important are universal access to health services, water and sanitation, public safety, justice, and
social safety nets (particularly important to protect the poor from drought i n the semi-arid Northeast).
Enviroiiniental sustainability (a more sustainable Brazil). Traditionally, development plans in the Northeast
have neglected the environment. Priorities are water resource management for more efficient use of this scarce

resource, land use planning in both rural and urban areas, prevention of desertification, protection of biodiversity, and institutional strengthening.

139. As part o f the focus on subnational clients, the Bank w i l l emphasize municipal governments as
key development partners in Brazil’s decentralized political structure, through direct lending and through
intermediaries, including the learning programs developed by ESAF (the training agency f o r the Finance
Ministry and related staff) in close collaboration w i t h WBI. Poverty has increased disproportionately in
Brazil’s large urban areas, particularly in the Southeast. The Bank i s developing a municipal strategy to
define the work in cities o f a l l sizes-large metropolitan areas, medium-size cities, and small towns (see
also B o x 14). W h i l e the Bank has a tradition o f lending to municipalities through apex institutions, it w i l l
embark on highly selective lending directly to creditworthy municipalities under i t s evolving strategy,
while continuing activities t o increase the governance capacity o f municipalities.

140. Investment lending in Brazil i s supported b y strong demonstrated government commitment to
the overall development program (reflected in government financing o f more than 90 percent o f the

aggregate annual development budget), a well-managed budget system, strong fiduciary systems (see
paragraphs 104 and lOS), satisfactory performance o f Bank-supported projects under implementation, and
acceptable maintenance o f assets financed under previous Bank-supported projects. W h i l e overall the
Bank adds to the financial resources available to the government, there i s no additionality with respect to
individual projects, since their financing envelopes are determined within the regular budget process. Under these circumstances, the t w o objectives o f the Banks counterpart funding policies-demonstration of
borrower commitment and sustainability o f funding over time-are materially met at the country level.

141. At the same time, application o f counterpart funding requirements at the project level has in
some cases become an obstacle to project implementation because o f the mechanisms the government
uses to control expenditures in Brazil’s constrained fiscal situation. This has slowed disbursements, contributing to inefficient use o f Bank funds at a higher effective cost. F o r this reason, the government has
requested greater flexibility in applying the Bank’s counterpart funding requirements, in particular at the

Box 12. Towards a M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Productive Amazon Region
The “Legal AinaLon” covers 60 percent of the BraLilian territory, with some 21 million inhabitants (in 2000). or
about 12 percent o f the population. Almost 70 percent live in cities and towns. The AinaLon i s also the largest
rain forest biome in the world, containing by far the largest portion o f remaining rain forest and up to one-fifth
o f the world’s freshwater. O f the original forest cover. 17 percent has been cleared, although at least a third i s
growing back. I t s global value i s seen in i t s rich biodiversity and the possible impact on climate o f i t s disappeaance.
The Amazon region i s challenged by a wide range o f issues, including lack o f consensus on development; the
sheer physical size of the region. with special relevance for social services, infrastructure, and transportation;
property right ambiguities and land use conflicts; unmanaged expansion o f cattle ranching and agriculture; rapid
urbanization and poor quality o f l i f e in cities: inability to control deforestation and tjres; role o f indigenous people in economic development and environmental management; and low institutional capacity and poor governance.
The Bank believes that i t can best contribute to sustainable development in the Amazon through three lines of
action :

.
.

Poverty reduction (a inore equitable Brazil). Pursue policies and investments to increase income and irnprove living conditions for the urban and rural poor, especially in the consolidated frontier (RondGnia, Mato
Grosso, and Par&), the poorest municipalities. and the poorest neighborhoods o f Bel6111and Manaus.
Environmental conservation (a more sustainable Brazil). lncrease support for federal and state policies and
progrcams that seek to sustainably manage natural resources, conserve biodiversity, arid protect environmental services in the Amazon, with a geographic focus on areas with critical biodiversity value, crucial e,nvironniental services, and cultural heritage.

Conditionsfor economic management (a more competitive Brazil). Enhance institutional capacity (public,
private, and civil society), improve land use management, and support environmentally sound economic activity and infrastructure, especially in the poorest areas o f the Amazon and in areas o f serious or anticipated
land use conflict.

Support would be provided through loans (to federal, state, and municipal governments), sector work, policy
analysis, knowledge management, and promotion o f partnerships. The major regional opportunity for guiding
Bank contributions would be the federal AniazGnia Sustent6vel program, with its linkages to the federal Multiyear Plan (PPA). A second opportunity w i l l be the Bank’s response to growing state arid municipal demand for
assistance in the Amazon. A third opportunity would be for Bank assistance to the national government i n reforming key financial and development mechanisms. Finally, the Bank can play a supporting role through its
involvement in the second phase o f the Pilot Program to Conserve the Rain Forest (Box IS).
Poverty alleviation i s essential to preserve the ecology o f the Amazon. IFC, in partnership with important corporations (DaimlerChrysler and Natura), i s supporting the development o f supply chains linking local communities
to the world market and improving the living standards o f the local population. TFC has also sponsored workshops in Brasilia and Manaus to promote better cooperation among private companies, NGOs. and local authorities: to achieve sustainable and equitable business development.

federal level. Considering strong borrower commitment and the expression o f government support for
projects through adequate budget funding, management proposes to apply such flexibility during CAS
implementation. This would allow, for the CAS period, greater flexibility on counterpart funding allocation for implementation o f investment projects.

142. Fourth, building on conclusions o f the recently completed Country Assistance Evaluation, the
Bank w i l l continue to place priority on a strong program o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA),

linked to policy and knowledge networks in Brazil with the help of WBI and the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN). The Bank has implemented a large AAA program, including comprehensive reports on key economic and sectoral issues, often developed in partnership with local research institutions
or other partners. The CAS Completion Report concludes that selected analytical pieces (on pensions and
education, among others) have been among the most successful activities over the last several years, helping to build consensus on policy and program design. A strong AAA program w i l l continue to be a critical complement to the Bank’s lending and technical assistance. The AAA program i s designed to play a
catalytic role in assessing policy options and tradeoffs for the government (at federal and subnational levels) and setting the framework for program design. The Bank i s increasingly developing programmatic
AAA, which involve a series o f advisory tasks with shorter turnaround time and a focus on immediate
policy choices, but within a strategic medium-term framework. Among the key elements o f the AAA program over the CAS period w i l l be support for a comprehensive Public Expenditure Review, in collaboration with PEA (the government’s economics institute) and other partners.
143. As part o f the focus on M A , development o f knowledge networks to facilitate the exchange o f
development experience among all development partners in Brazil i s a key feature o f this CAS. WBI has
selected Brazil as one of i t s focal countries and has established arrangements with local learning partners.
The Bank has initiated a strong GDLN capacity in Brazil, focused on outreach and improving the
effectiveness o f Bank-supported AAA and projects through dissemination and capacity building. As part
o f i t s knowledge programs, the Bank has facilitated the creation of communities o f practice, including a
network o f mayors (Muninet) and a network o f researchers and policymakers focused on poverty
reduction in the Northeast and North (REDE NOS). Over time, the Bank may seek to link these
communities o f practice within an overarching “learning forum.”

H. Areas of the World Bank Group Program
144. Because the three dimensions o f the vision for Brazil-equitable, sustainable, and competitiveare interlinked, the Bank’s program of assistance i s multisectoral, with an added emphasis on institutional cross-sectoral strengthening. I t emphasizes concerted actions across a group o f sectors to reach a
specific goal (for example, actions in health, water, and education to reduce infant mortality). And i t em-

40

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

phasizes a number of cross-cutting issues, taking account of regional endowments and the importance o f
strengthening institutional capacity and participation to enhance accountability, transparency, and ownership. Similarly, the Private Sector Strategy (Annex 5) takes a multisectoral approach--cutting across key
sectoral issues relevant to private sector development.
145.
The thematic areas o f focus are overlaid with a spatial dimension and explicit regional strategies to guide Bank activities. Consistent with the C A E finding that the Bank’s targeting o f support to the
poorer Northeast has had an important impact, the Bank w i l l continue i t s strategic focus there. A Northeast strategy lays out the specific approach (Box 11). In response to growing interest from the federal and
state governments, the Bank would increasingly focus on the North and i s working with the government
through i t s AmazBnia Sustentivel strategy (Box 12). These regional strategies w i l l build on and influence
state strategies.
146.

Given the depth and scale of Bank support to Brazil, the need to adjust to the evolving priori-

ties o f the government, and the evolving fiscal situation in different states and municipalities, i t i s neither
feasible nor desirable to present in this CAS a final l i s t o f tasks for the next four years. Instead, this sec-

tion lays out the areas that are envisaged as priorities for Bank support. Illustrative lending and AAA programs are described below (see also the indicative program tables in Annexes B 3 and B4).

A M o r e Equitable Brazil: Investing in People
147. The Bank’s strategy for support for a more equitable Brazil, highlights o f which are shown in Table 9 and discussed in greater detail below, closely mirrors the priorities o f the federal government, which
has made social progress with economic stability the cornerstone o f i t s program and the PPA. At the
subnational level, improving welfare and empowering people are also at the heart o f state and local development strategies. Support in the social sectors would be focused on reaching the poorest and achieving higher levels o f quality and efficiency in social services.
148. The Human Development Programmatic Sector Reform Loan series would be the Bank’s
flagship vehicle for supporting improvements in health, education, and social protection policy frameworks at the national level. This program (first loan in FY2003) would be complemented by investment
loans at federal, state, and local levels (see below). Depending on reform progress, several additional
loans within this series could be made during the CAS period, with different areas o f emphasis within a
broad and ambitious reform agenda. Planned technical assistance loans would support reforms, focusing
especially on monitoring and evaluation o f key social programs and on institutional capacity building.
149. Building on the recommendations o f the CAE, support to education w i l l be a key priority. Improving education quality and outcomes would continue to focus on basic education, with increasing involvement in secondary education, early child development, and higher education. The Bank’s analytic
work i s likely to be increasingly programmatic; a key focus could be a review o f education policies over
the last decade. The Bank would support a model for early child education at the local level through a
pilot in Rio de Janeiro Municipality. If successful, this could be scaled up to other cities and perhaps a
national program. The Bank may support a follow-up to the successful Fundescola series. A higher education student loan project and a science and technology project are possibilities to build s k i l l s for a modern
economy, following AAA on s k i l l s and knowledge issues. In higher education, there i s scope for synergy
with IFC through i t s possible support o f broadened access to private university and vocational training.
These projects would also contribute to the objective o f a more competitive Brazil.
150. In health, the Bank would continue to support improved quality and equity o f national disease

loan (APL) with an important focus on indigenous populations. Family Health I
I(APL) would help to
extend family health services to the urban poor and improve health system performance. Key analytical
work i s likely to focus on hospital performance. IFC, similarly, w i l l look to enhancing the performance o f
private health care providers.

15 1. Consistent with the aim o f ensuring a coordinated and integrated development strategy at the state
level, lending to states i s becoming m o r e multisectoral. The Bank would support operations to meet the
specific development outcome objectives o f each state, in many cases linked to improving the Human
Development Index. Thus, a share o f Bank state lending in the coming CAS period would have education
or health as a “lead sector,’’ (e.g., Pernambuco Education and Maranhiio Rural Integrated in FY04).
152. In social protection, the Bank would expand i t s support through AAA, technical assistance, and
direct lending. A key part of the strategy i s an ambitious multiyear program o f AAA and technical assistance (“BRASA”) that would help the government strengthen the effectiveness and results-focus o f i t s
social safety net (Box 13). Building on this work, the Bank would support through a programmatic SWAP
operation Bolsa Familia (FY2004) the government’s recently launched effort to integrate the social safety
net’s several cash transfer programs. Technical assistance for monitoring and evaluation as well as improved targeting would be a linked to this SWAp. Support for pension reform (programmatic lending and
technical assistance under the

under consideration. In addition, to get a clear sense o f the
barriers to labor market entry
for the poor, the Bank could undertake AAA to review international experience on policies and programs
to reduce those barriers. The Bank could also support a community-based development fund to improve
living conditions in urban municipalities, focusing on services that help the poor better prepare for employment (drug treatment and prevention, j o b services, child care). Following ongoing AAA on youth
issues, the Bank could pilot a project in one or more large urban centers on youth at risk. Public safety
and youth at risk components could also be integrated into the work with a number o f states. WBI would
provide support by helping to disseminate the results o f AAA and developing capacity-building activities.

A More Sustainable Brazil: Providing Local Services and Managing Natural Assets for Better Quality of Life
154. The Bank’s support for a sustainable Brazil i s directed at improving the quality o f life through
support for local services in urban and rural areas and for careful management o f Brazil’s rich natural assets and the spatial dimension o f development. Table 10 reflects these priorities, which are discussed in
further detail below.

155.
A primary element of the ongoing and planned program i s support for increased access to basic
services in rural and urban areas. In urban areas, in the context o f an integrated urban strategy, the Bank
could continue to selectively support urban transport, building on ongoing support to metro systems in
large cities which have contributed to poverty reduction b y increasing the access o f the poor “trapped” in
urban peripheries to affordable transport. Water supply and sanitation w i l l be complemented b y further
support for urban services through a number o f vehicles at both federal and state level. Support at the federal level would focus on policies and program design; support at the state and local level would focus on
~

Box 14. Toward Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Cities and Municipalities
More than 80 percent o f the Brazilian population lives in urban areas-in the urban core o f metropolitan areas.
the periphery o f metropolitan areas, large urban areas. medium-size cities, or small towns in otherwise rural areas. More than half the country’s poor live in urban areas (and poverty in large cities has grown), and 90 percent
o f the country’s GDP i s generated i n urban areas. Lack o f long-term f k ” i n g sources together with the rising
investment needs and borrowing capacity o f many municipalities has led to increased demand for direct lending
from international financial institutions.
The Bank’s operational strategy for working with urban municipalities i s s t i l l being discussed and i s expected to
be, fully developed over FY2004 as a sectorally integrated effort i n collaboration with other partners, including
IDB. I t i s likely to emerge along the following lines:

Large cilies and metropolitail areas are experiencing some o f the highest increases i n poverty. These are the
areas where brown environmental problems are most acute, and most obviously affect the urban poor. The Bank
expects to support direct lending operations in several large cities or municipalities that form part o f nietropolitan regions. For example, the Bank i s preparing a loan for Betim, a large municipality in the metropolitan area of
Belo Horizonte. This operation w i l l serve as a pilot for future direct operations with municipalities.
Medium-size cities are among the fastest growing in Brazil. Like all cities, they lack access to adequate domestic
financing for local investments. The strategy w i l l likely emphasize a wholesale approach rather than direct lending. Examples include state interventions, such as the Bahia and Ceara integrated projects that focus on targeting
strategic secondary cities in these, states: regional onlending through regional financial intermediaries; national
onlending through national financial intermediaries; and lending to consortia o f municipalities through credit
union arrangement.
SnraZZ cities and towns generally lack financial capacity. With the exception o f some specific investment projects, such as the Small Municipalities Water Supply and Sanitation Project, a
nce to small municipalities
will focus on knowledge management primarily through the Municipal Management Knowledge Network
(Muninet), which i s being designed as a national network benefiting all municipalities in Brazil, and through
‘ijust in time” technical assistance to the federal government on local government and urban management issues,
in partnership with the Cities Alliance and other partners whenever feasible.

In addition to developing strategies for working directly with municipalities, the Bank w i l l continue to explore
avenues for working with local governments through federal transfer programs. Supporting federal programs
though SWAps or other means o f trailsfelring federal funds to municipalities for infrastructure financing i s another approach that will be studied.
IFC’s ongoing and planned support at the municipal level focuses on fostering public-private partnerships
through voluntary actions by the private sector. For example, IFC, together with the Ethos and Polis Institutes
(local NGOs) supports an initiative to develop tools for private sector’s support to the Fotne Zero program. The
TFC i s providing the two NGOs a US$300,000 grant and setting up the preconditions for bringing together 959
municipalities from Brazil’s poorer regions (most in the Northeast) with private sector companies interested in
assisting the municipalities under the Fome Zero program. IFC’s Funds are helping carrying out a study to assess
local demand, compile information, and create a database, a web site, a call center. and a guide book for private
companies. The objective i s to link municipal antihunger programs with companies that are willing to help.

integrated approaches to service delivery in the context of broader local or regional development strategies.
The Bank would support the start-up o f a federal program for water and sanitation in a Small
156.
Municipalities Project (FY2004), which may lead to a larger water and sanitation SWAp. The government
has also requested Bank support to increase access to electric power services for the poorest, which the
Bank could support through a programmatic approach with private sector participation. Dialogue with the
government on housing may lead to a technical assistance operation and a SWAP supporting the improved targeting and efficiency o f the government’s housing programs for poor households. The Bank
would continue to work with the government on improving land titling.

157. At the local level, the Bank i s developing a municipahrban strategy that w i l l guide support to
large metropolitan regions, medium-size cities, and small towns, where the need for basic services i s most
critically felt (Box 14). This strategy would be closely coordinated with IDB’s ongoing work at the municipal level. The Bank could support a series o f operations for medium-size cities (starting with a possible pilot in Betim in the metropolitan area o f Belo Horizonte) aimed at an integrated mix o f technical assistance and investments to enhance local management capacity and improve services and natural resource management. Especially at the local level, the Bank would continue to support participatory
mechanisms, for example, to determine investment priorities. Capacity building at the local level i s also a
priority, to be supported through WBI, GDLN, and other approaches, including with partners.
158.
Measures to reduce crime and violence would be an increasingly important part o f Bank support
in urban activities. The Secretaria Nacional de Seguraqa M b l i c a i s a key partner in the Bank’s Regional
Urban Crime and Violence Prevention Capacity-Building Program. Other ongoing activities include the
incorporation o f a crime and violence prevention perspective in ongoing and possible future urban and
infrastructure projects. More work in this area might include AAA identifying problems, existing programs, needs, and policy recommendations. The Bank might also provide technical assistance for municipal capacity-building programs and for crime and violence prevention pilot initiatives.

159. Consultations on this CAS brought out the importance of supporting culture as an asset and a
public good essential for empowering people. The role of culture and the importance o f building on cultural strengths were seen as important in the success o f any country’s economic development strategy.
Cultural dimensions would feature in social and employment programs. Integrated state projects, in particular in the North and Northeast, could contain mainstreamed culture components.
160.
The government has requested assistance for a Sustainable Development Programmatic Sector
Reform Loan series that could support policy reforms and improved institutional capacity to monitor and
manage water, land, forest, and other natural assets and would provide the framework for Bank support
for a sustainable Brazil. T o be developed in consultation with interested parties in the c i v i l society and the
private sector, this program could also build on corporate environmental responsibility initiatives, possib l y in conjunction with IFC. Depending on reform progress, several loans within this series could be
made during the CAS period, each focusing on different areas o f this reform agenda. In this context, the
Bank could also support a possible follow up to the ongoing National Environment TA project, and have
complementary efforts with a national forestry project.
161. In rural areas, especially the Northeast, state rural poverty projects have benefited over 7.5 million people and empowered communities to lead implementation o f low-cost local service provision.
These projects rely on key roles for local councils and community associations. They have been successful in achieving significant poverty reduction and improving local governance. Building on this model,
selected state-based sectorally integrated loans w i l l support a range o f services in rural areas while pro-

Box 15. Pilot Program to Conserve the Rain Forest
The, Bank i s the coordinator o f the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest (RFPP), created in 1992
at the initiative o f the G-7, and trustee o f i t s trust fund (WT). Iniplementation began in 1995, and the program i s
on the threshold of a second phase. With committed and pledged resources o f US$350 million, the RFPP acts
through largely experimental projects meant to show the way toward larger initiatives that could be mainstreamed.
The RFPP has helped to strengthen e,nvironinental agencies and management in most o f the Legal Amazon states
and demarcated some 45 million hectares of’ indigenous lands (I0 percent of the Amazon). I t has supported more
than 200 (mostly community) initiatives related to new forms o f land use and conservation, including management o f forest and aquatic resources; strengthened extractive reserves; helped create ecological corridors i n the
Amazon and Atlantic Forests; helped rehabilitate science centers and support directed research; and supported
NGO networks. Local ownership o f the’ program has also increased, with the government assuming program
leadership b y the end o f the first phase.

The second phase should be an integral part of the government’s AmazSnia Siistentrivel program supported by
Brazil’s international partners. The Bank believes that this can he done most effectively through:
1

Creating a think-tank capacity to observe and assess trends in the Amazon. disseminate successful lessons
and models to advance their mainstreaming, analyle and suggest policies for sustainable development, build
capacity to support these activities in civil society organimtions and the private sector, and maintain a clearinghouse of work being done throughout the region.
Supporting high-priority piloting i n areas not included i n the first phase, such as low-impact cattle ranching
and pasture management; land tenure, titling, management, and conflict resolution; implementation o f an effective forest concession system; payment for environmental services; management o f genetic resources:
and preservation arid application o f traditional knowledge.

Continuing to learn from ongoing activities, with an emphasis on documenting and mainstreanling lessons
and successful models and providing inputs for policy forinulation.

tecting the environment. The projects would continue to focus on the Northeast but encompass the North
as well. Among projects planned in FY2004 are those in Tocantins, Amapfi and Maranhzo.
162. The Bank would continue to support states’ efforts to improve land use and management in rural areas, building on successful experiences in several states in the South and Southeast. Support for a
community-based approach to improve access to land in the rural Northeast (CrCdito Fundiario) has had
substantial results and could be continued or expanded under a program o f broader support for family agriculture. State projects-as the current proposals in Amapfi, Maranhao and Bahia-are increasingly taking a holistic view o f development challenges. Better natural resource use, including land management, i s
likely to be a component in a number o f state projects.

163. The Bank would continue strong support to Brazil’s federal and state governments in better managing scarce water resources, in particular in the arid Northeast, and improving water quality, in particular in the urban Southeast. A follow up Water Resource Management Project at the federal level could
focus on the efficiency o f water use in the Si50 Francisco basin (for which technical assistance i s also
planned). State water resource management projects are also possible, following the model o f current projects in several Northeast states. As flagged in the strategy for the Northeast (see Box 11)’ water resource
management and water supply and sanitation services are drivers o f development in the region. Bank support for water quality (building on successfully completed pollution control projects in Brazil’s southeast)
are also possible.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

164. Learning from past experiences i s crucial in the complex area of natural resources management and poverty reduction. The natural resource management projects started in the 1990s and recently completed in Mato Grosso and RondGnia (Prodeagro and Planafloro, respectively) had a difficult
implementation. Following the largely negative experience o f the previous Polonoroeste regional development program (implemented in the 1980s), these projects incorporated some, but not all, o f the lessons
o f past failure. Among them are the need to understand the political economy o f the frontier, the crucial
importance o f building ownership not only among beneficiaries but with all stakeholders affected, the
benefits and pitfalls of decentralization, the vital role o f local institutional capacity, as well as the clearer
priority for these efforts in both the government’s and the Banks overall programs. These points were
elaborated in the Learning Implementation Completion Reports of these two projects, and are being
heeded and proactively built into proposed lending and other activities with a resource management focus.
165. Protecting forests and biodiversity has been a key element in the Bank’s strategy for more than
a decade, through participation in the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest (RFPP). The
Bank would continue to manage the RFF’P trust fund as the program moves into a second phase (see Box
15). The Bank has prepared a contribution to the government’s Amazon Strategy (described above),
which w i l l generally guide the Bank’s work in the Amazon region. The government has also requested
Bank assistance to support a new National Forest Program. A forest loan (likely an APL) would aim at
implementing improved forest management practices and help address the increasing deforestation rate.
In addition, GEF-supported projects for the Cerrado and Caatinga are possible, as well as a pilot initiative
on biodiversity protection in areas with indigenous populations. The Bank can support the conservation
and rehabilitation o f the Atlantic Forest biome by participating in the Critical Ecosystems Partnership
Program, financing micro-basin projects, and supporting the Atlantic Forest Project and the Atlantic Forest N G O Network through the W P .
166. Through the Prototype Carbon Fund and related carbon finance vehicles, the Bank can help
develop Brazil’s world-scale carbon trading market b y further project development, capacity building,
and replication o f best practices. Efforts are under way to link carbon finance benefits to community development and poverty reduction. Current carbon finance projects include the Plantar Project, replacing
coal and coke with sustainably produced charcoal in the pig iron industry. Several other projects are under
development, including the use o f landfill gas, wood, and sugar cane residues for power generation. The
I F C has also been active in carbon trading through the IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (see Annex 5 on
Private Sector Strategy).

A M o r e Competitive Brazil: Spurring Sustainable Growth
167. In the Bank’s program of support, growth has now gained equal priority with social equity and
fiscal balance. Not only i s economic growth desirable in itself (with low inflation rates since the Real
Plan, the income o f the poor has grown roughly in line with overall growth), but without faster growth i t
w i l l be increasingly difficult to sustain both improved social assistance and fiscal balance. Economic
growth increases government revenues to fund social spending. And productivity growth helps debt sustainability and exports. For these reasons, this CAS increases the emphasis on Bank support for sustainable, broad-based growth, accompanied by IFC’s strong support to the private sector (paragraphs 175177). The Bank’s strategies to support higher productivity and investment focus on more efficient
infrastructure and competition regulation, a deeper financial sector, a modern innovation policy, and a
more favorable environment for entrepreneurs, especially small and medium-size enterprises. These priorities are further discussed below (see also Table ll).
168. The Programmatic Reform Loan Series for Economic Growth w i l l be the flagship vehicle for
improving productivity and growth and w i l l reflect the priorities mentioned above. Several loans within

48

A M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive B r a z i l - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

the series could be made during the CAS period, with areas o f emphasis depending on reform progress. In
the first phase, the government i s preparing a new innovation law and a new bankruptcy law, restructuring
the antitrust system, publishing a white paper on infrastructure regulation, and defining a wide range o f
measures to reduce logistics costs. Technical assistance loans would support this reform agenda.

169. The growth agenda loan series would also encompass support for the continuation o f financial
sector reforms, that were supported through two earlier Financial Sector Programmatic Reform Loans.
The growth loan series would build on earlier financial sector lending to support further basic legislation,
reduced spreads, increased long-term finance, and measures for enhanced access to financial services.
Additional support would come through AAA on reducing financial intermediation spreads and related
issues and through ongoing and future technical assistance loans.
170. A key aspect o f the government’s strategy for increasing the rate and quality o f growth i s the development o f a range o f policy areas simultaneously, such as infrastructure regulation, competition policy,
innovation and technology policy, and the financial sector. Structural reforms in these areas, as opposed
to special subsidies or tax exemptions to capital, promise the most for equitable and sustained growth. A
strategic goal o f the Bank’s program i s to support and strengthen this integration of policies, creating
a coherent, effective, and politically feasible growth agenda. This i s an important attribute o f the
Bank’s emerging program for economic growth in Brazil: integration across sectors (and involving diverse public institutions) i s both the strongpoint o f the operational approach and one o f the greatest challenges for implementation o f reforms and the Bank’s own assistance.
171. The Bank i s supporting the development of a more modern regulatory framework for transport
through the Highways Decentralization Project, which also aims to provide a more sustainable arrangement for road maintenance. The Bank could also support transport maintenance and regulatory reform
through a follow-up highway project that could be undertaken as a SWAp. Strengthening o f the existing
road network, better planning and integration of multimodal networks, and increased private sector participation are the objectives o f the Bank’s involvement in the transport sector.
172. The details of the government’s plan for the new structure of the energy sector remain to be
determined. The recently approved Energy Sector Reform Technical Assistance Loan w i l l help implement critical reforms for attracting investment into the energy sector and ensure that the objectives o f the
earlier Energy Sector Reform Loan are attained. The Bank may also support the government’s plans to
universalize access to electricity through a SWAp.
173. Partial risk guarantees, in the context o f Brazil’s evolving public-private partnership framework, could increase the credibility of public regulation o f private infrastructure investments, thereby increasing much needed private sector participation in infrastructure investment. The Bank plans to explore
the use o f this instrument with the government.
174.
Several integrated state projects could focus on productive infrastructure and the growth
agenda, including transport, water supply and integrated urban development. These areas are closely
linked with the sustainability agenda discussed above. In very selective cases, the Bank could provide
state adjustment lending to support fiscal and pension reforms or offer i t s guarantee facility to attract investment in key infrastructure.

175. IFC will continue to play a strong role under the theme o f a competitive Brazil and more generally in support o f private sector development that cuts across the three key thematic areas o f this CAS
(Annex 5, Private Sector Strategy). IFC’s continued support to the Brazilian private sector w i l l focus on
enhancing prospects for competitiveness and growth and on improving social equity through voluntary
actions by the private sector.
176. Enhancing prospects for competitiveness and growth would entail supporting growthgenerating firms with a wide network o f stakeholders, export enhancing activities including infrastructure
and logistics, and activities for improving access to long-term financing. Depending on market conditions,
IFC might have to rapidly adjust i t s short-term priorities within the CAS framework, as was the case with

50

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

i t s rapid deployment of trade finance facilities during the last CAS period. IFC w i l l continue to focus on
the choice o f instruments for investment activities, with the objective of optimizing riskheturn profiles. I t
w i l l also pursue i t s objective o f having a catalytic effect on financial markets, raising financing through
i t s B-loan program and other means. Export-oriented sectors (including mining, hydrocarbons, agribusiness, and manufacturing) and infrastructure, important to competitiveness, w i l l also receive attention. The
financial sector, crucial to the growth and productivity agenda, w i l l continue to be an area o f focus for
IFC, through support o f local enterprises, especially smaller firms that lack access to term financing
through local intermediaries, and support o f transactions that develop the domestic financial sector, including capital markets.

T o improve social equity through voluntary actions by the private sector, IFC w i l l support
177.
the growing momentum toward socially responsible activities within the Brazilian private sector. The
Brazilian corporate sector i s increasingly recognizing that a competitive Brazil depends in part on greater
social equity and sustainability. IFC’s assistance w i l l involve support for better corporate governance, the
Fome Zero program, socially oriented entrepreneurship, and firms committed to environmental and social
sustainability.

The Foundations: Ensuring a Stable Economy and Good Governance

179.
The main objective o f Bank support for ensuring macroeconomic stability would be the reduction o f vulnerabilities through effective debt management and a stronger institutional framework for fiscal
policy, directed at increased credibility with investors. As long as Brazil i s supported b y an IMF program,
the Bank w i l l complement that program in i t s areas o f expertise, such as debt management, social security, other structural expenditure reforms, and public expenditure management. In the absence o f such
program, the Bank could step up i t s own macroeconomic work. Highlights o f the Bank’s strategy are discussed below (see also Table 12).
180. The Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan series would support the policy framework for Bank
assistance, including macro-fiscal management and structural fiscal reforms as well as expenditure man-

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

51

agement and public sector reforms. Depending on reform progress, several loans in this series could be
made during the CAS period with different areas o f emphasis within this broad and ambitious reform
agenda. Public sector management reforms, including public expenditure management, could be supported by a new technical assistance loan to accompany the programmatic loan series and complement
ongoing technical assistance. The Bank would provide AAA and technical assistance for fiscal institutions and debt management, including related governance arrangements. The fiscal and financial sector
teams w i l l work jointly on linkages between debt management, debt market development, and the increasing role o f pension funds for debt markets.
18 1. The Bank would continue to support social security reforms through technical assistance, AAA,
and the Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan Series. This support builds on past AAA as well as three ongoing technical assistance operations supporting pension administration reforms at federal, state, and municipal levels. Sectorwide lending encompassing the scope o f several current technical assistance loans
would be an option. The approval o f social security reforms at the federal level would open the way to
support implementation of these reforms at the state level, including through fast-disbursing lending directly to states.
182. Improving the quality of public spending and developing an evaluation culture and capacity w i l l
be a central tenet o f Bank support across sectors. This agenda i s broad and ambitious, including structural
reforms, spending allocation choices, and efficiency improvements in program implementation and administration. The Bank i s initiating support for Public Expenditure Reviews by several partners in the
government through a multiyear programmatic AAA, which may be complemented b y technical assistance lending to support public sector and budget reforms. This work would be aligned with planned sectorwide lending approaches and would strengthen them as well. Also, WBI would play an important role
b y complementing analytical work with a learning and capacity building agenda.

183. A key element o f the quality o f the public spending agenda i s the strengthening of public expenditure execution functions, including improvements to already sound financial management and
public procurement practices. In moving to sectorwide lending approaches, the Bank w i l l seek to link the
public sector policy agenda for continued improvements in financial management and procurement practices, especially at the subnational level, with the Bank’s fiduciary responsibilities. The aim i s achieving
the highest systemic impact, drawing from recent C F A A and CPAR, as well as planned work. For example, a fiscal reform loan focused on public sector management, and an accompanying TAL, could include
support to budget execution and procurement modernization and capacity building.
184. Brazil i s experimenting with innovative approaches to improve participation in public decision-making processes and their transparency. These range from participatory budgeting and planning o f
new spending to the creation o f the Social and Economic Development Council (CDES) as a mechanism
for national-level consultations on structural reforms, incorporation o f the dimensions o f gender and ethnicity, and new institutions for fighting corruption. The Bank could support a number o f these initiatives,
probably through technical assistance grants, and help with evaluation and learning to share these experiences broadly in Brazil and elsewhere. The Bank already supports CDES through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant and has engaged CDES in extensive discussions o f the CAS. Future AAA
would focus on the framework and evaluation o f these diverse initiatives. The Bank would respond to
opportunities to support the growing number of anticorruption initiatives that are being launched b y governments at all levels. This would build on the experience o f recent support, through WBI, to the SBo
Paul0 Municipality for the development o f an anticorruption program.
185. Recent AAA supports the efforts o f the courts to improve their performance. Under the appropriate circumstances, the Bank could respond to interest from the judiciary with support through further
AAA and possibly technical assistance.

186. Public expenditure issues are particularly important to states and municipalities, which are responsible for the provision of many basic services. Capacity constraints are paramount, and WBI, GDLN
and other knowledge and learning instruments are playing an increasing role. Muninet, a Bank-facilitated

network o f mayors; REDE NOS, a community of practice concerned with poverty reduction and social
inclusion in the Northeast; and related W B I and GDLN programs are squarely focused on this challenge.
187. Support for subnational governance and public management capacities across sectors would
be an important aspect o f state-integrated development projects. Projects would include a component to
addresses cross-cutting public sector management issues, such as capacity building for better policy
analysis and expenditure review, and focused support for specific policy reforms. These “horizontal”
components should contribute to both greater institutional sustainability and replicability. The Bank i s
experimenting with a variety o f modalities for designing and implementing these components in different
states and drawing lessons from implementation experiences. Programmatic AAA on state public sector
management would complement this approach. Monitoring and evaluation o f public programs i s also a
priority, and components to build systems and institutional capacity would likely be a priority in a number
o f thematic areas, across government levels. Examples include a seminar on monitoring and evaluation in
the context o f the PPA at the federal level, and a joint OED/WBI led pilot in the state o f MaranhZo.
These efforts are closely linked to the results monitoring approach o f the CAS.

I. R i s k s and Lending Cases
188. This CAS i s designed to capture the opportunities and minimize the risks inherent in Brazil’s
current development challenges. O f course, the risks for Brazil remain overwhelmingly outside the control of the Bank. But they imply risks for the Bank’s finances and reputation. The main way to manage
these risks to the Bank i s through linkages to lending ranges that scale the Bank’s financial commitments
to Brazil’s progress on policy reforms and implementation, as defined b y policies that are likely to advance Brazil toward the desired development outcomes.
189. With the slowdown in commitments and disbursements from investment loans, Bank exposure to
Brazil increased only modestly during the last CAS period, from US$7.6 billion in June 2000 to US$8.6
billion in June 2003. With large principal repayments due in FY2004 and FY2005, there i s room to substantially increase lending to Brazil during this CAS period. Lending would have to support the implementation o f policies that would lead to achievement o f the desired development outcomes.

190. The scale o f financial support during the CAS period would be determined primarily b y govemment policy performance in the three CAS thematic areas and the foundations area. The base case o f this
CAS i s divided into a lower and a higher lending range (Table 13).
0

0

Excellent policy performance across the key areas and continuing high financial need would be
the basis for financial support in the higher range of the base case o f US$6-7.5 billion. Policies
would provide a high likelihood o f economic sustainability and rapid progress toward the desired
country outcomes. In this case, Bank exposure would increase. Lending under this scenario of
good policy and implementation performance could be front-loaded, with up to US$2.2 billion
during each o f two years and lower thereafter. This lending range could be adjusted upward
through good portfolio performance and cancellation o f undisbursed commitments, observing the
Bank’s concentration limit o f US$13.5 billion. Adjustment lending over the CAS period could
reach up to half the range ceiling.
Reasonable policy performance would be the basis for financial support in the lower range of the
base case of US$4-6 billion. Policies would provide a reasonable likelihood o f economic sustainability and gradual progress toward the desired country outcomes. In this case, Bank exposure
would be managed between US$8 and US$10 billion. Adjustment lending over the CAS period
could reach up to half the range ceiling. Again, cancellations and good portfolio management
could expand the space for this range.

A More Eauitable, Sustainable, and ComDetitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategv FY2003-2007

54

191. A low case would be characterized by weakening policy performance, which would imply a
significant likelihood of failure to maintain economic sustainability and progress toward desired country
outcomes. In this case, the Bank would seek to reduce i t s exposure, would not exceed average annual
lending o f US$1 billion, and would not provide adjustment lending.
192.
There are two special cases that would be discussed with the Board if the need arose. With excellent policy performance but extremely difficult external conditions, the case for special lending could
arise again. Alternatively, weak policy performance in the face of negative external shocks could lead to a
contingency scenario, which i s not considered in this CAS.

193. In the spirit of the results framework, the main consideration in determining the lending range i s
the likelihood of attaining the stated development outcomes. A small number o f macroeconomic and
structural reform triggers would neither capture this approach nor be appropriate for Brazil’s situation,
where challenges are related to institutional, policy, and implementation progress rather than to a few
structural measures.
194.
Consistent with this approach, Table 14 presents policy performance indicators that would be
used to assess the applicable lending range for three points in the base case range. These indicators are
illustrative and not comprehensive. N o t every indicator would need to be met for the respective range to
apply. The overall range would reflect the appropriately weighted sum o f performance assessments in
each area.

The country team and the government would undertake semi-annual joint reviews of policy
progress to assess the case for each o f the areas and revise the lending program accordingly. These reviews would also ensure the highest level o f ex ante agreement on and commitment to the lending program from both sides.
197. As o f October 2003, Brazil’s performance was broadly consistent with several indicators for the
upper limit of the base case range in the macroeconomic foundations thematic area and in some aspects o f
the equity thematic area, such as education. However, in some facets of the competitiveness and the sustainability thematic areas, performance would correspond to less than the midpoint of the base case. Because o f very slow disbursements, driven b y the lack o f fiscal space, portfolio performance would correspond only to the low case-although steps to address this are underway as discussed elsewhere. All
things considered, the current situation would put Brazil above the midpoint of the base case range.
198. Throughout, this CAS emphasizes the linkages between progress in the main policy areas. A large
lending program would have to reflect the balance across the CAS thematic areas and foundation area
in a balanced (not necessarily equal) composition o f lending. Especially in the higher base case range, the
increased support would necessarily span the different CAS areas. An indicative lending program representing this balance for the higher range o f the base case i s shown in Annex B3.
199. The lending envelope for the base case includes policy-based adjustment lending of up to half
the total envelope, based on Brazil’s continued substantial external financing requirements and i t s strong
record o f policy reforms in an environment o f tight fiscal adjustment, which l i m i t s financial support
through investment lending. At the same time, innovative investment lending instruments are expected to
permit commitments of investment lending higher than in recent years, contributing to a reasonable balance between investment and adjustment lending.

Satisfactory macroeconomic performance would be a requirement for policy-based lending.
Evidence would be satisfactory performance under an IMF program. Even in the absence o f an IMF program, the IMF would likely continue close macroeconomic surveillance, and the assessment o f macroeconomic performance would be undertaken in close consultation with the IMF. Macroeconomic work b y
the Bank might be intensified under such a scenario. Given the very large financial commitments from the
IMF in recent years, concerns about the relative financial contribution o f both institutions would not apPly.

J. CAS Implementation
201.
A key vehicle for implementation w i l l be a semi-annual review of policy, program, and portfolio issues by the country team with the federal government (coordinated b y the Ministry o f Planning/SEAIN and the Ministry o f Finance/SAIN). These reviews would cover policy reform performance
in each o f the three key programmatic (thematic) areas plus macro fundamentals, agreed program indicators (triggers and benchmarks for programmatic adjustment and investment lending), the planned lending
(with a special focus on SWAps and subnational lending) and AAA program, and implementation performance on the ongoing program, including performance on project-specific benchmarks and developments within the context of the broader CAS results monitoring framework. Through lending and AAA,
the Bank w i l l also seek to help clients build capacity and systems to improve data quality and data collection and evaluation s k i l l s to strengthen the results focus.

This CAS builds in a consultative process for mid-course corrections and adjustments during
202.
implementation. This would be done through thematic and regional consultations with the government’s
Council of Social and Economic Development, integration of WBI learning activities and programs (both
face-to-face and through distance learning), and the gradual transformation o f GDLN programs and partners into a Brazil “learning forum” designed to share information and knowledge across a wide range o f
partners in Brazil. These initiatives would provide constant, more qualitative feedback on CAS priorities
and activities and on the Bank’s performance.
203.
The Brazil program and team i s highly decentralized, with implementation very close to the
client. The Country Director, Sector Leaders in the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development (ESSD) and Human Development (HD) Networks, and the Implementation Team Leader are based
in Brazil, along with strong decentralized sector teams and the team handling procurement, financial
management, disbursement, and legal matters from the field. This means that the program i s highly
responsive to client needs and concerns. In addition, regular coordination among sector leaders ensures
highly sectorally integrated management of the program that seeks to maximize sectoral cooperation and
synergies.

ANNEX 1: “A Brazil for All” - Brazil’s 2004-2007 Multi-Year Plan (PPA)

BACKGROUND
Brazil’s 1988 Constitution requires the use of three main instruments to guide fiscal and public
expenditure management: (a) the Multi-Year Plan, or Plano Plurianual (PPA); (b) the L a w o f Budget Directives (LDO); and (c) annual budget laws (LOA). The PPA i s a four-year plan to be produced b y each
newly elected government at the beginning o f i t s four-year mandate. The PPA i s approved b y the national Congress. The nature and scope o f the PPA have changed since first initiated in the late 1980s, but
the current government proposal modeled in a similar fashion to the previous PPA.

OBJECTIVESAND SCOPE OF THE 2004-2007 PPA
The Executive’s proposal for the 2004-2007 PPA has just been finalized and sent to Congress.
Entitled “A Brazil for All” (“Plano Brasil Para Todos”), the PPA aims at progress along five “dimensions:” economic, social, regional, environmental and democratic. These inter-related strategic priorities
are reflected in the PPA’s three core “macro” objectives:
(a) enhanced social inclusion and reduction of inequality;

(b) economic growth ( 5 percent target for 2007) that i s environmentally sustainable and reduces
regional inequalities; and
(c) promotion citizenship and participation, contributing to better governance and public sector
management.
Submitted to Congress in September and expected to be approved b y November 2003, the new
PPA lays out a program o f approximately US$l50 billion annually over four years. Explicitly recognizing Brazil’s budget rigidities and lack o f fiscal space, i t i s framed in financial terms consistent with the
country’s revenue projections. I t also relies on prudent external borrowing and seeks to maximize private
sector financing, in particular in the area o f infrastructure investments key to growth. New elements in
this PPA are the regional focus, and a strong element consultation with c i v i l society, including “participation forums” in each of the country’s 27 states (below).
Another innovation, the new PPA i s results-focused. Each o f the three “macro” objectives i s broken down into ten or so “challenges.” Each o f these 30 challenges has a group o f target indicators achievable b y 2007 - which become the key drivers o f the PPA (Tables 1 and 2). Every one o f the PPA’s
374 individual “programs” i s aligned toward meeting one or the 30 challenges and their specific target
indicators. The strong priority allocated to the social inclusion agenda i s reflected in funding plans: social
programs dominate planned PPA spending (57 percent), followed b y growth oriented programs (33 percent), and participation (10 percent).

MAINFEATURES
OF THE 2004-2007 ‘‘PLAN0 BRASIL PARA TODOS”PPA

The PPA i s primarily an instrument for the strategic allocation o f the federal government’s budgetary resources. It shares some characteristics o f the medium-term expenditure framework (or budgeting
in a multi-year framework) used by many OECD countries. However, i t has features that make i t different and unique. The following are the main characteristics o f the 2004-2007 PPA along with selected

The entire Federal budget for the four years covered i s broken down into several hundred different “programs” (374 for the proposed 2004-2007 PPA compared with 388 for the 2000-2003
PPA). Examples o f programs for the 2004-2007 PPA are “Conditional Income Transfers” (addressing the government’s efforts to provide income transfers to all poor households using a unified income transfer scheme) and “Maintenance o f the Federal Road Network.” Each program
has one or more specific goals, and indicative funding i s specified (for each program rather than
for each organizational unit or government body). The result principle drives this: resource allocation should be based on the pursuit of objectives rather than on the notion that each government
body should receive some specified share of the total resources.
The monetary amounts allocated to the PPA programs are consistent with macroeconomic and
revenue projections for the four years covered b y the PPA, which take into account the government’s fiscal commitments over the period (i.e. in the case of the 2004-2007 PPA, maintaining a
primary public sector surplus of 4.25 percent o f GDP every year). The aim here i s to avoid lack o f
fiscal realism.

In addition to the consistency o f the PPA with macroeconomic projections and the government’s
fiscal commitments, annual budgeting during each PPA period i s done using the framework of
programs and classification established b y the PPA. In this and other ways, there i s an explicit attempt to bridge the institutional gap - common worldwide - between planning and budgeting.
For some programs, e.g. those dealing with infrastructure, the PPA also states expected amounts
o f funding from sources other than the Federal government, e.g. from state governments or the
private sector. Thus, the PPA attempts not only to better use budgetary resources, but to mobilize
private sector and external financing.
In each PPA, the programs are embedded in a framework that lays out a set o f overall “megaobjectives” and “macro-objectives”. The framework i s hierarchical; under each mega-objective i s
a set o f macro-objectives, and under each macro-objective i s a set o f programs. In the case o f the
2004-2007 PPA, merged into the framework i s the concept o f “dimensions.” The use o f this type
o f framework underlines the fact that the PPA i s not just a tool for budgeting or for resource allocations; i t i s also a strategic device used to guide the country’s overall development. I t i s also
used b y the government to build support for key proposals, and to communicate these to society.

0

Each program has a set o f clear goals, with performance indicators or targets specified, so as to
foster a culture o f performance-orientation. For example, for the program “Conditional Income
Transfers,’’ the target i s to ensure that 12.7 million poor families receive income transfers in 2007,
including all families with per-capita monthly incomes less than R$lOO. For the program “Maintenance o f the Federal Road Network,” the targets are that 43,000 km o f roads should be maintained annually, and that in addition 23,000 km o f road length should be restored.

0

Each program has a manager, who i s in charge o f ensuring that the performance indicators are attained. This builds on the 2000-2003 PPA’s efforts to foster clear accountability. An explicit objective of the previous PPA was a more integrated approach and move away from the traditional
view o f government responsibilities divided along organizational unit lines. Thus managers often

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

61

needed to seek the cooperation of other program managers in other agencies. I t i s likely that the
new PPA w i l l also stress this integrated approach in implementation.
0

There i s a strong emphasis on the use o f information systems in the implementation o f the PPA.
A computer network interlinks all program managers and partners, to allow immediate access to
information concerning all projects. The aim i s to enable these lead actors to share information,
promote partnerships and identify impediments to achieving goals.

0

In line with the emphasis on performance, the PPA has an annual process whereby each program
manager has to evaluate progress and discuss the evolution o f the program’s performance indicators. The ensuing reports are made available, for each program, on the Internet. These selfassessments enhance transparency and force the program manager to discuss the progress or lack
thereof regarding the performance indicators, as well as the problems faced in program implementation.

0

Although the PPA itself does not prioritize among the different programs, the L a w o f Budget Directives (LDO) specifies a number o f “strategic programs” each year. In principle, these programs give an idea of the relative importance placed b y the government on different programs.

0

Among the key principles of the PPA are the fostering o f transparency and inclusion o f c i v i l society. The latter i s especially emphasized by the current government, which went to great lengths to
include different members o f civil society in the discussions that led to the formulation o f the
2004-2007 PPA. During the process o f formulating the 2004-2007 PPA, great emphasis was
placed on obtaining participatory input from different members o f society, much more so than for
the previous PPA. This was mainly done through 27 “Forums o f Social Participation” - one in
each state (and the Federal District). The forums involved 4738 participants in total, representing 2170 organizations including urban and rural labor unions, business groups, churches, social
bodies and non-governmental organizations. Various themes were covered, such as health, education, the environment and culture, among others. The discussions had a significant impact on the
choice o f macro-objectives in the PPA, as well as on the selection o f programs, actions and program performance targets.

COMPARISON OF THE 2000-2003 AND 2004-2007 PPAS

Comparing the two PPAs (see Table 3), i t i s clear that there i s a lot o f similarity between the sets
o f macro-objectives for the 2000-2003 and 2004-2007. There are a few differences, however, that stand
out. One o f these i s the objective “Expand and improve income transfer schemes for poor families” in the
2004-2007 PPA which i s new; there i s nothing similar in the previous PPA. This reflects the emphasis
placed b y the new government on a unified and expanded income transfer scheme as a key component of
i t s social protection strategy, and illustrates the use o f the PPA to highlight and promote key goals o f a
new government.
Another novelty o f the new PPA’s macro-objectives i s the emphasis placed on social issues such
as land reform, gender and racial equality, and social inclusion o f indigenous people (see macroobjectives 9, 10, 14 and 23). Social inclusion i s also reflected, in a different way, in the new macroobjective o f aiding small and medium enterprises (see macro-objective 21). In addition, the new PPA includes macro-objectives related to governance and fighting corruption (see macro-objectives 28 and 29).
All of this reflects some o f the stated priorities o f the new government. In accordance with these priorities, the new government has also emphasized social inclusion in the formulation o f the PPA itself, as discussed in the next section.

62

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

In terms o f the macro-objectives related to economic growth, there i s one new objective that
stands out in the 2004-2007 PPA, which i s the desire to expand and improve domestic capital markets
(see objective 12). In view of the current constraints to domestic borrowing - in particular, the high
spreads between lending and borrowing rates -this represents an important inclusion in the new PPA.

Ultimately, of course, i t i s not enough to l i s t macro-objectives; sufficient funds must also be allocated to each. A limited analysis o f the 2004-2007 PPA shows that - at least in some cases - new programs have indeed been created to address some o f the new macro-objectives that were not in the previous PPA. One o f these i s the program “Conditional Income Transfers”, for which R$3 1.94 billion i s allocated (over four years) in the new PPA; this i s a larger amount than for most programs. Other new programs, with no equivalent in the previous PPA and which address the new macro-objectives in the new
PPA, include “Correction Within the Federal Executive” (which tackles government corruption); “Promotion o f Public Ethics” (which addresses governance issues); “Gender Policy”, “Gender Equality in Work
Relations”; and “Policy for the Promotion o f Racial Equality”.
Finally, a few aspects are worth noting regarding the treatment o f infrastructure in the new PPA.
First, in line with the government’s stated desire to increase public investment which has been l o w recently (2.6 percent of GDP in 1999), the new PPA allocates R$297 billion over the four-year period from all sources, including public banks, sub-national governments and the private sector - for infrastructure. As a rough guide, using the PPA’s targets for inflation and economic growth,” the amount o f infrastructure spending allocated would amount to about 4 percent o f the total GDP for the period . In addition,
the new PPA allocates R$5.5 billion for the program “Maintenance o f the Federal Road Network”; this
same program (with the same purpose) was included in the previous PPA, and was allocated R$3.7 billion
(in 2003 dollars). The increase i s meant to address the urgent need pointed out b y many to reverse significant decay that has occurred in the country’s highway road network.

l7For years 2004,2005,206 and 2007, these are respectively 7.5%, 5%, 4.5% and 4% for inflation using the IGP-DI
index; and 3.5%, 4%, 4.5% and 5% for economic growth.

Summary
This document contains the Regional Department’s evaluation o f the contribution o f the Bank’s program in Brazil
during the previous CAS period (2000-2003). I t concludes that the CAS structure and content were consistent with
the government program and the country’s long term goals, although the government placed greater emphasis on
infrastructure than the Bank during this period. I t further concludes that the Bank program overall made a satisfactory contribution to Brazil’s development, despite the fact that country progress during the period fell below initial
expectations in some areas, notably economic growth.
Areas o f success were the priority pillars selected by the CAS, namely programs o f direct poverty reduction
(particularly health and education) and support to fiscal reforms. On the first o f these two pillars, Bank impact was
highest on health and education, less pronounced on social protection. In health, the pooled sector-wide lending
approach was a successful innovation. On the second pillar, Bank impact was highest on macroeconomic
management, less pronounced on the quality o f public expenditures. Programmatic lending i s a useful new
instrument that has strengthened the Bank’s dialogue on macro management, and could be applied more widely.
Social protection and the quality o f spending are both areas that now deserve greater emphasis.
Despite a wide array o f investment lending, adjustment lending (financial and energy sectors), and AAA pursuing
the growth agenda, the Bank’s program had insufficient impact on growth in the period (beyond the positive effects
o f stabilization). In particular, vital reforms to the regulatory environment did not progress.
In the two remaining pillars o f the 2000 CAS, governance and environmental management, progress has been
mixed. On governance, the Bank program has been deliberately cautious and selective, and the Bank’s contribution
has been slight. On environmental management, although country progress has been only moderate, the Bank has a
large program including i t s executive role in donor-funded initiatives, and important successes have occurred in
those areas the Bank has focused on.

Overall the report judges that the Bank made a significant contribution to Brazilian development in 2000-2003, particularly in the first two pillars, where the CAS promised to focus the Bank’s efforts and resources. This conclusion
i s consonant with the findings o f the recent Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) and - although the C A E assesses
the longer period o f 1990-2002 - the Completion Report draws on the C A E approach and findings. Increased strategic focus on the Northeast and on the relationship with the states has paid dividends, as has continued acknowledgement o f the central role o f fiscal management in Brazil today. The harder issues o f detailed public spending
analysis, improving the microeconomic environment for growth, building institutions to tackle exclusion and violence, and the execution on the ground o f environmental protection are some o f the key challenges for the next CAS
period.

This report represents a self-assessment o f the World Bank’s contribution in Brazil during the last
CAS period (2000-2003). Part A discusses to what extent the CAS was aligned with country priorities and
long-term goals. Part B looks at country performance over the CAS period, and tries to the extent possible
to assess the Bank’s role b y to tracing a correspondence between Bank efforts and country progress. Part

C evaluates the Bank’s performance over the period from the viewpoint of co’mparative internal quality
indicators. Especially in a country of Brazil’s size, where the Bank’s role i s small in comparison, i t i s impossible to assign cause and effect with confidence, leaving inevitable room for interpretation in the final
conclusions.
I t would be untoward to undertake such an exercise without putting i t into the context o f the Operations Evaluation Department’s (OED) recent Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE), which although i t
overlaps on some terrain i s an independent and much deeper evaluation over a longer period of Bank support (1990-2002). On many points the present discussion echoes the CAE. Nonetheless, the completion
report in some ways complements the C A E by isolating the most recent progress and b y reporting views
predominantly from within country and project teams.

PARTA

- LONG-TERMSTRATEGIC

GOALS

Brazil’s Multiyear Plan (PPA) lays out the Federal Government’s national development strategy
every 4 years. The 2000-2003 PPA” differed from i t s predecessor in that i t accounted for all federal
spending, rather than only core investments. I t i s therefore a good representation o f federal government
strategy, although i t should be noted that many investments, incentives, and recurrent expenditures are
undertaken by states and municipalities. Despite the existence o f state PPAs, i t i s hard to evaluate the collective effect o f these strategies for the country as a whole. Moreover, the notion o f a development strategy encompasses policies as well as spending, and here i t i s perhaps easier to base our analysis on actions
rather than government documents.
The 2000 PPA was based on a technical “Axes Study” o f Brazil’s geographic bottlenecks (in
many cases logistical) impeding economic growth,lg which defined priority (public and private) investments o f 3 17 billion reds over eight years, including infrastructure (186 billion), social development (113
billion), environment (16 billion) and information and knowledge (2 billion). Federal spending i s grouped
into 365 programs, each with an objective, a set o f actions, and performance indicators.
The 2000 PPA defined six long-term strategic goals:
1. The consolidation o f economic stability with sustained growth;

2. The promotion of sustainable development for employment and income;
3. The fight against poverty and promotion o f citizenship and social inclusion;

4. The consolidation o f democracy and human rights;

5. The reduction of inter-regional inequalities; and
6. The promotion o f the rights o f minorities and victims o f discrimination.
B y comparison, the Bank’s 2000 CAS2’ was based on a five-pronged framework that was consistent with the PPA goals, though not identical in structure:

71

1. Direct poverty reduction and social development;
2. Fiscal stability;

3. Economic development and growth;
4. Development effectiveness (the performance of public institutions); and

5. Environment and natural resource management.
Within these five themes, the first two were given priority. Poverty reduction i s the overriding objective o f Bank assistance, while fiscal stability was deemed to be o f such immediate urgency that it warranted special treatment: a loss o f fiscal discipline would have had an immediate and long-lasting impact
on poverty rates.
I t can be seen that the Bank’s assistance strategy was in line with the Government’s long-term
strategy, with certain differences o f emphasis. The main common elements could b e summarized as follows:
0

Both the 2000 CAS and the PPA accepted the fundamental importance o f poverty reduction as a
primary goal o f economic development.

0

Both made explicit the regional dimension o f poverty, citing the worse social performance o f the
North and Northeast regions, and adopted region-specific responses to support lagging regions.

0

Both emphasized the importance o f a sustainable approach to natural resources and the environment, although in this area the Bank’s relatively cautious approach was in line with government
policy.

0

Both emphasized the importance of social inclusion and empowerment as important goals o f public policy.
The main differences between the Bank’s strategy and the Government’s could be summarized as

follows:
Economic growth was given greater direct importance b y the government program (as was therefore, implicitly, the inter-linkage between growth and stability), especially infrastructure investment, as evidenced by the geo-economic approach to the “removal o f logistical barriers” in the
Axes Study. The Bank recognized the interaction between growth, poverty, and stability in Brazil
in the 2000 CAS, but made a strategic decision to give precedence to fiscal management.
The CAS did not discuss democracy and human rights (in doing so i t followed Bank practice in
many other countries).
The CAS made explicit the cross-cutting theme o f the effectiveness o f public institutions,
whereas this objective was implicit in the government’s own program, woven throughout the
PPA.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

72

0

The CAS took a more cautious approach to the themes o f minority rights and discrimination. This
need not imply criticism o f the Bank: arguably the approach was appropriately cautious, since the
emphasis placed by Brazilian governments on these questions was relatively recent.

O f these differences, the withdrawal from large-scale infrastructure lending represented the most
significant divergence from government priorities. I t was largely driven b y the expectation that private
investment would meet infrastructure needs, and b y the recognition that conceivable lending volumes
from the Bank would not have made much difference. Although the expectations o f private investments
have not been met, i t remains the case that larger investments by the Bank would not have made a substantial difference to Brazil’s stock of infrastructure. This leaves unanswered the question o f whether
greater lending to infrastructure could have hastened progress on regulatory reforms, a counterfactual that
i s impossible to judge.
Finally, the differences in framework between the two strategies should not be oversold, recognizing the inter-dependency among outcomes within the five CAS pillars: fiscal discipline promotes longterm sustained growth, effective institutions promote social development, and environmental management
protects the assets o f the poor, to mention but three linkages. The conclusion that the Bank’s program satisfactorily reflected country priorities was also a finding o f the Country Assistance Evaluation recently
discussed by the Committee on Development Effectiveness.

PARTB

- CAS OUTCOMES

BACKGROUND
TO THE 2000 CAS
The 2000 CAS was prepared in the period following the collapse o f Brazil’s quasi-fixed exchange
rate regime in January 1999. This was a period o f relief and optimism in Brazil. The consequences o f the
devaluation on Brazilian economic indicators in 1999 had been less severe than feared, and in 2000 the
economy grew by a healthy 4.5 percent. Social progress prior to the 2000 CAS, despite the eventual macroeconomic crisis, had also been significant. While income poverty had fallen mostly around 1995-1996,
education and health indicators had improved throughout the decade.
However, increasing debt ratios (most notably total public debt to GDP as well as total public and
private external debt to exports) had jeopardized continuing progress, a danger most clearly illustrated b y
the 1998 crisis. The healthy growth o f 2000 opened up a current account deficit o f nearly 5 percent o f
GDP, prompting fears that, without further macroeconomic reforms, either growth and social progress
would be weakened or another crisis would ensue.
These factors explain the strategic decision o f the 2000 CAS to focus on fiscal balance and direct
poverty reduction policies - where despite progress, spending was ill-focused and there was room for
budget-neutral (efficiency driven) improvements in impact.
The 2000 CAS also built on strategic decision taken earlier, most clearly outlined in the 1997
CAS. Common threads running throughout both the 1997 and the 2000 strategies were the overarching
priority given to poverty reduction (reflecting the Bank’s overall strategic shift under President Wolfensohn) and the importance attributed to Brazil’s fiscal underpinnings. Two new and important elements o f
the 1997 CAS had been the number one priority among policy sectors given to education as the long-run
driver behind Brazilian poverty and inequality, and the intensification o f the direct relationships, through
lending and non-lending services, with the Brazilian states. T o these elements the 2000 CAS added a
more explicit focus on the Northeast region, and a move (in light o f the key role played b y macroeco-

73

nomic management and the limited room for investment lending) towards programmatic policy-based
lending.
OUTCOMES BY PILLAR

This section assesses country progress and Bank contribution in the five pillars o f the 2000 CAS.
In doing so, i t i s at times necessary to expand the period under analysis further back than 2000-2003. Data

for the CAS period are as yet scarce (for example we cannot report poverty rates for 2002 and 2003) and

- even when they are available - three years i s too short a period for many outcome indicators to change
significantly. Moreover, the 1995, 1997, and 2000 assistance strategies essentially represented continuity,
since they were prepared under the same government leadership and reflected similar long term goals.
I t should also be acknowledged that the 2000 CAS was not formally a “results-based CAS” so
that in some areas i t lacked clear quantifiable targets for country and Bank performance. Nonetheless, in
each o f the five pillars, i t i s possible to identify the main criteria by which the Bank meant to judge country progress, as should be apparent from the discussion below.

The Bank’s own internal performance measures are considered later in part C. In this part, the
correspondence o f Bank efforts (whether lending or other) with areas of progress by Brazil i s discussed as
evidence of the Bank’s effectiveness in supporting the government’s agenda where, in the Bank’s estimation, i t contributes to poverty reduction and social progress.

Pillar 1: Direct Poverty Reduction Policies
a)

Country Progress

Five main areas within this pillar deserve the most detailed attention since they received emphasis
in the CAS and were provided with clear indicators o f progress:

1. Education, from early childhood development (ECD), through primary and secondary education,
to adult literacy;
2. Health, emphasizing the development o f replicable models o f good practice;
3. Rural development initiatives, including increasing their income-generating impact, and reinforcing the market-based land reform efforts o f recent years;
4. Water and sanitation, including good practice models o f provision and management; and
5. Strengthening the social safety net, including better targeting o f programs, and the expansion o f
conditional cash transfers such as the then state- and municipal-led Bolsa Escola.
In education, the 2000 CAS emphasized the need to increase quality in primary education and
thereby help increase secondary enrollments, but also called for rising adult literacy and participation in
E C D centers. On ECD, there has indeed been increasing participation - the Government’s target i s o f
universal availability by 2007. Of the previous government’s other targets for 2007 - 98 percent enrollment age 6-14, 70 percent age 15-17, improving test scores, and 349,000 new school places - those related to enrollment are on target, while those related to quality are not. The testing system (SAEB) was
strengthened in 2000-2003, but 2001 scores in Portuguese and mathematics were similar to or slightly
worse than those o f 1999. One explanation i s that many new students are now entering the system from
disadvantaged backgrounds.

In health, falling disease-specific mortality rates were a central indicator, and here progress has
been excellent. Incidence of AIDS peaked in 1998 at 15.9 per 100,000, declining t o 12.0 by 2001; mortali t y rates from AIDS have also declined significantly. These trends are in part a result of free universal
access to anti-retroviral therapy mandated by the Federal Government since December 1996, and in part a
result of the government's strong HIV/AIDS prevention program. The incidence o f malaria decreased by
50 percent between 1999 and 2002, while Tuberculosis registered a 26 percent decline between 2000 and
2002. The government also achieved targets of 30 percent coverage for ages 1-19 with Hepatitis B vaccination, while coverage of infants less than one year increased to 82 percent, from 7 1 percent in 2000. The
incidence of dengue and leishmaniasis increased, the former due to a nation-wide outbreak in 2002, while
the latter may be related to improved surveillance. A further policy goal was 50 percent coverage o f fami l y health agents: national coverage reached about 35 percent in 2002, although this i s now increasing.

In rural poverty reduction, the main indicators o f country progress were (slowly) falling rural
poverty, increased land resettlements, and improved targeting o f rural infrastructure (water, electricity,
roads). Progress has been mixed. Rural coverage of water and electricity has increased, and in doing so
has reached further down the income distribution. Poverty has fallen in rural areas, although not at the
rates desired, and the falls in poverty observed (about 3.5 percentage points between 1995 and 2001: see
the Poverty Annex to this CAS) may partly owe themselves to out-migration to urban or metropolitan
areas (where poverty has risen). The expansion o f road access and o f income generating activities in rural
areas has been disappointing. Land reform (in part owing to the new community-based model) increased
significantly in pace during the CAS period.
Water and sanitation, a key to improved living standards particularly in urban areas, has been a
problem area for Brazil. About 2 million households in Northeast Brazil live without adequate water supply, while almost all rivers crossing urban areas are highly polluted. The main obstacles have been regulatory: the solutions lie in decentralized management, clearly defined roles o f federal and state agencies,
river basin authorities, and water user associations. Clear water rights and bulk pricing would encourage
sustainability, but in general have been slow in coming.
Finally, progress on social protection relative to the CAS indicators has been satisfactory, if only
partial relative to Brazil's needs. In 2000-2003 Brazil tried new models o f social transfers (at the federal
level the Program to Eradicate Child Labor, Bolsa Escolu, Bolsa AlimentqZo, and more recently Fome
Zero, not to mention a host o f state and municipal programs). These programs differ in their design and
likely success, and in fact the lack of objective evaluations i s an issue in the sector, but there i s little doubt
that now more resources are reaching the poor than at the beginning of the past CAS period. The Government now plans a rationalization o f many o f these programs to further increase the resources reaching
the poor.
Overall, Brazil has made notable progress on direct poverty reduction and social programs. One
overall measure i s that during a period o f l o w growth, income poverty measures have remained approximately constant, and many other social indicators (related to health, education, and basic service coverage) have continued to improve. Important challenges remain in the quality o f education, improving water
and sanitation, rationalizing social assistance income transfers, generating income in rural activities, and
tackling unemployment. But on a positive note, in most cases these are the focus of the new initiatives o f
the present government.

Bank Contribution

As already outlined, educational expansion has been a notable Brazilian success o f recent years.
Expansion o f basic education has been supported by state-level Bank initiatives in Minas Gerais, Par&
Bahia, and Cearh, as well as collaborative analytic work on Fundef, which helped expand i t to secondary
and pre-school education. Fundescola, a federal fund for improving basic education quality, has received
important financial and technical support from the Bank. The national educational testing system (SAEB)
was strengthened and institutionalized during the CAS period with Bank financial and technical assistance. Quality remains a serious concern: all Bank projects, especially at the state level, are targeting agegrade distortion.
On health, as the Family Health Program reached about a third o f the population b y 2002, i t had
not yet the object o f Bank lending support. The Bank Family Health Extension project was launched in
2002. The sector-wide pooled lending approach (SWAP) pioneered under this project i s proving effective
at transferring Bank management resources towards substantive policy impact and away from day-to-day
operational management, as well as easing loan disbursement in the context o f a client with satisfactory
procurement practices: this experience suggests the wider applicability o f the SWAP instrument in Brazil.
The HIV/AIDS Control Project I
Icontributed to falling disease-specific mortality rates b y financing 780 NGOs (from 181 in 1997) to conduct prevention interventions among high risk populations. Prevention efforts are also being carried out with state and municipal government entities, with a total number o f subprojects increasing from 132 in 1999 to 276 in 2002. In addition, the project has financed condoms and doubled the number o f voluntary counseling and testing sites. Treatment and care services and
the laboratory network to follow up patients receiving treatment were also strengthened. On other diseases, the Vigisus project focused on malaria, TB, leishmaniasis, hepatitis B, leprosy and dengue in the
nine states constituting the Legal Amazon, where cure rates for TB (75 percent) surpassed the national
average (about 50 percent). Improving surveillance i s also an important objective for Vigisus.
On rural poverty reduction, the Bank has contributed with community-driven development projects in all Northeastern states (with new projects imminent in Minas Gerais, Alagoas, MaranhBo, and
Sergipe). This i s one of the largest areas o f lending in the Brazil portfolio, with $665m in outstanding
loans. A recent evaluation o f this family o f projects gave a positive overall assessment: in particular the
program's use o f community councils has helped build up social capital that may now form the basis o f a
wider range o f activities. But as noted above, despite these widespread initiatives rural poverty statistics
have proven stubbornly slow-moving; newer project are thus attempting not only to increase impact on
revenue-generating activities, but also to integrate the community-driven components more closely with
other government activities in the same communities.

Rural poverty has also been targeted b y the Bank's community-based land reform projects in the
Northeast. These projects have been controversial domestically since they adopt a different model o f land
reform from that o f land occupation that i s also practiced widely in Brazil. The first Land Reform project
had been the object o f two reviews b y the Inspection Panel. Both reviews praised the project approach,
however, and within the last CAS period these operations have contributed to an increase in the number
o f families resettled on their own land in rural areas (over 100,000 people have been settled to date under
the Bank supported crkditofundia'rio projects).
Urban development has been an area of weaker performance nationally, and the Bank's presence
has been limited. Bank support through specific urban projects has focused on water through support to
sector-wide reforms (Prosanear ZZ) and in Cearfi through support to regional development using urban
poles (Prourb). The recently signed integrated Recife metropolitan project (Prometropole) represents an

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

76

important new attempt to develop an integrated model o f urban development involving the state and two
municipalities, although i t i s too early to report on progress.

On social protection, the Bank’s support has been limited to technical assessment and advice. The
Bank produced reports on the Program to Eradicate Child Labor (PETI) and Bolsa Escola, and technical
inputs in the preparation o f the Fome Zero program. The Bank i s increasing i t s activities rapidly on social
protection, with programmatic AAA (including work on the new Primeiro Emprego program) and likely
sector-wide support. Support for labor market reforms has been limited to ESW.21AAA activities that had
a broader focus on poverty and inequality have raised awareness o f social policy issues such as illtargeted social spending, unbalanced social security transfers, and the key role o f education in poverty
and inequality, a l l important against a backdrop of restricted spending during the fiscal adjustment.
Broader social inclusion and empowerment have been supported by smaller but well-regarded Bank initiatives, such as the annual Brazil Innovation Day, which has awarded grant funding to innovative c i v i l
society activities such as the Diadema community project, which has reduced crime in one area o f Silo
Paulo.
Overall, the Bank fulfilled its 2000 commitment to focus most resources in direct poverty reduction strategies, and there i s evidence, both in terms of quality assessment and in terms o f country progress,
that Bank support has made a contribution to this CAS pillar.

Pillar 2: Fiscal Stability
a)

Country Progress

Brazil’s fiscal management over the last CAS period has in many ways been exemplary. Indeed,
economic analysis conducted for the recent Brazil Country Economic Memorandum suggests that specifically Brazil’s ability to adjust i t s fiscal policy in response to varying external circumstances i s what has
guaranteed relative stability during a period o f challenges.22The main indicator o f fiscal discipline scrutinized b y the bond markets i s the primary budget surplus generated to pay debt service. In 2000 Brazil ran
a primary surplus o f 3.5 percent; in 2003 this i s expected to be about 4.3 percent.
I t i s nonetheless striking that Brazil’s public debt to GDP ratio i s slightly higher than i t was at the
beginning o f the last CAS period (55.4 percent net debt to valorized GDP at end June 2003 compared to
48.7 percent at end 1999, see figure l).23
Total external debt (including both public and private) has
stayed about constant as a fraction o f GDP over the CAS period, moving from 44.8 percent at end 1999 to
a projected 43 percent at end 2003.24

23 Most countries measure net debt as a ratio of nominal GDP: by this measure Brazil moved to 59.4 percent at end
June 2003 from 53.0 percent at end 1999.
24 Although the public component o f the external debt ratio has risen from 18.8 percent o f GDP to 24.3 percent (est.)
by end 2003. Outstanding dollar amounts have fallen over the period for the private sector.

Brazil's Debts and Deficits, 1999-2003

Opublic debt .exlemal debt

Two principal (related) explanations reconcile rising debt stocks with rising primary surpluses:
rising debt service costs and currency depreciation. In Brazil's case, debt costs have been driven up b y a
familiar l i s t o f challenges, external and internal, that the country has had to deal with in this CAS period.
These have been listed many times, but i t i s worth rehearsing the most important here:
0

Brazil's own energy crisis, which came to light in the spring o f 2001, and was owing to l o w rainfall in the context of a long history o f under-investment in generation capacity;

0

The market reverberations o f September 11, 2001;

0

The Argentine debt crisis of late 2001 onward;

0

Market uncertainty in 2002 about Brazil's continued fiscal performance after the general election;

0

Lower than forecast economic growth in the OECD from 2001 throughout the period.

These factors have contributed to increase spreads on Brazilian sovereign bonds and to depreciate
the currency.
0

0

0

Spreads increased from levels in the 600s (measured in basis points) in late 1999 to over 2,400
during Brazil's most worrisome moments o f the last CAS period in mid-2002. They are now back
at levels (in the 600s) not seen since early 2000.
Similarly, the IMF estimates that the real effective exchange rate, after rising b y 6.7 percent in
2000, fell by 17.0 percent in 2001 and by a further 13.3 percent in 2002. This has raised the real
value o f public and private sector liabilities denominated in or linked to foreign currencies.
Finally, nominal depreciation drove up inflation, and the Central Bank was forced to raise interest
rates in the latter half o f the CAS period to contain inflationary expectations (the preservation o f
the inflation targeting regime being a notable achievement during the CAS period). Since about
half o f public-sector debt i s indexed to the overnight interest rate that the Bank uses for monetary
policy, this also has the side-effect o f raising debt service costs.

The net result o f these effects has been that despite rising primary surpluses, the nominal budget
deficit (i.e., the public sector borrowing requirement) has risen, from 3.6 percent o f GDP in 2000 and
2001, to 4.7 percent in 2002 - with a s i m i l a r projection for 2003.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

78

Measuring against possible.counterfactuals, one reason for the weak performance o f these risk indicators has been the path taken on deeper public-sector reforms during the period. The 2000 CAS listed
three objectives under the heading of Fiscal Adjustment:
0

Social security reform, measured by the net present value o f the reforms passed during the period;

0

Administrative reform (particularly at the state level), permitting reduced public sector consumption (particularly payroll) and greater creditworthiness;

0

Fiscal management, including improved public debt management (to reduce debt service costs),
continued surpluses, and improved quality o f the adjustment (minimizing i t s impact on growth
and equity).

In light o f these objectives, i t i s possible to give an assessment o f this area during the CAS period.

On social security, politics rendered progress impossible in 2000-2002. Brazil had passed reforms
to the private system (INSS) in 1997. The new government has now proposed to Congress a reform to the
public system (RJU), which the Bank estimates w i l l save amounts o f the order o f one-half a percent o f
GDP per year for the next 10 years. There w i l l remain the need for further reform in order for Brazil’s
fiscal sustainability to be assured over the longer run. But over a reasonable time horizon, and given the
political difficulties o f passing these reforms, these recent developments are highly positive.
On state administrative reform, progress has been marked in certain states (e.g., Bahia) while disappointing in many. Meanwhile, adherence to the 2001 Fiscal Responsibility L a w (LRF) has been farreaching, implying that many states have seen their budgets squeezed and have found i t difficult to make
investments. The State Governors’ attempts to ensure that the tax reform currently being debated b y the
two houses does not further cut into state revenues reflects this history. But apart from trying to protect
revenues, many states are recognizing the need for further improvements to the structure o f spending, and
some are articulating requests to the Bank for support in this area. The assessment for the CAS period
should therefore be that progress on administrative reform has been disappointing for the country as a
whole.
On fiscal management, we must distinguish between “quantity” and “quality.” On quantitative
measures, the Federal Government has made striking progress on three levels:
0
0

0

Primary surpluses have been increased in flexible response to requirements;
The LRF was passed in 2000 and moreover has become more than a law “on paper” - i t has been
translated into a credible code o f action in practice;
Public debt management improved.

Qualitative measures are b y their nature harder to assess, but declining investment in infrastructure, a declining proportion of the budget devoted to “discretionary” spending, and increasing budgetary
rigidities (earmarking, etc.) all point to a lack o f progress in budgetary quality. This i s now a top priority
for action.

b)

Bank Contribution

As related above, progress in fiscal management has been marked on quantitative indicators,
while the “quality o f adjustment” remains an issue. Since Bank support targeted the broad area o f fiscal

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

79

adjustment mainly through programmatic policy-based lending, assessment o f Bank performance necessarily reflects this state o f affairs.
Social security reform came later and in smaller doses than the 2000 CAS might have hoped for,
but nonetheless (along with the LRF) represents one of the most important single reforms since the elimination o f inflation b y the Real Plan. This i s a good example o f a cycle o f programmatic Bank support
making a significant contribution to a key reform agenda. A program of research and informal advice led
to the publication o f an important piece o f ESW in 2000.25A single-tranche loan operation supported the
reform o f the private sector pension system in 1999. Subsequently, small-scale TA loans have had high
impact at state and federal levels. Ultimately, further progress may form the basis o f future programmatic
lending.
Reforms to improve the quality of government expenditures - for example through increased
spending flexibility (reduced earmarking), administrative reforms, and more careful evaluation o f impact
- have been an area o f relatively slow progress, and until recently the Bank has failed to make much impression here in the absence of a strongly articulated request from government for technical work. This
has now changed, with a new effort being coordinated in Brasilia to reduce budget rigidity and increase
spending impact at the federal level, along with the Bank’s response to a series o f states’ requests for support for public sector management.
Programmatic policy-based lending has given strong support to both the introduction and the implementation o f the LRF, a key reform for Brazil. The government has expressed appreciation for the
flexibility offered by programmatic policy-based lending. Another area o f progress, public debt management, has been supported through ESW, TA, and also the programmatic fiscal reform loans. Finally, during the government transition in 2002/2003, the Country Economic Memorandum provided the incoming
administration with guidance on relative priorities.26Future ESW and lending w i l l target the quality o f
spending as Brazil’s priority cross-cutting issue in the fiscal area.
Overall, despite the remaining challenges, Brazil has performed well on fiscal reforms, and the
Bank has supported this performance through a strong combination of ESW, informal advice, TA, and
programmatic policy-based lending.
Pillar 3: Economic Growth
a)

Country Progress

Economic growth has seen perhaps the greatest divergence between the optimism o f 2000 and
subsequent country performance. After an encouraging rebound from the 1999 devaluation, unforeseen
factors prevented the attainment o f almost all analysts’ growth forecasts for Brazil in the period 20012003.
Despite this disappointment, i t i s important to put Brazil’s economic growth into regional perspective. For the period 1999-2001, Brazil grew at 2.3 percent per annum, while L a t i n America and the
Caribbean (LAC) outside Argentina and Brazil grew at 2.1 percent. In 2002, Brazil grew 1.5 percent;
L A C minus Brazil and Argentina grew at 0.8 p e r ~ e n t . ~To
’ some extent, what ailed Brazil ailed the region
at least as much.
“Brazil: Critical Issues in Social Security,” 1999, Report No. 19641-BR.
“Brazil: Stability for Growth and Poverty Reduction,” 2003, Report No. 25278-BR.
27 Obviously including Argentina during these periods makes the L A C performance worse: in 1999-2001 L A C outside Brazil grew annually at 0.8 percent, and in 2002 at -2.7 percent.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Nonetheless, the first unforeseen factor to arise -the 2001 energy crisis - was Brazil-specific and
i s informative for policy. Against a background o f slow privatization (less than 30 percent o f generating
capacity i s today private), public generation and transmission companies had cut investments (anticipating privatization and subject to fiscal constraints). Rules prohibiting generators from passing costs on to
distributors and price controls on distribution also served to deter private investment. Unpredictable
regulation and the presence ,of a vertically integrated state monopoly in generation discouraged new
private-sector entry. In sum, the regulations governing pricing, contracting, and industry structure did not
provide the right incentives for reliable energy supply. After more than a decade o f demand outstripping
supply and falling spare capacity, low rainfall in 2000-2001 was merely the straw that broke the camel’s
back.
The moral i s that the regulatory framework (not only in energy, but in other key sectors such as
transport, water, telecom, and banking) has become a growth bottleneck for Brazil. The 2000 CAS recognized the importance o f regulation for growth, but a finding of the recent C A E was that insufficient attention has been paid by the Government and by the Bank to this area.
The 2000 CAS listed growth issues under seven headings:
1. Regional (multi-modal) transport, measured b y successful concessions and falling logistics costs;

2. Urban transport, measured mainly by the population served;

3. Energy, notably the establishment of more competition in the sector and a reliable energy supply;
4. Financial sector development, including increased private-sector intermediation, a stronger banking safety net, and possible further privatization o f state banks;

5. Private sector development, including the adoption o f corporate governance laws to protect minority shareholders, a new bankruptcy law, enhanced competition policy, laws governing publicprivate partnerships, and taxation reforms;
6. Rural growth, mainly through expansion in large-scale agriculture;
7 . Higher education and technology, including more efficient financing o f higher education and
greater links between higher education and private-sector innovation.
There i s little reason to doubt the diagnosis implied by the above list, but i t i s striking that little
progress overall has been made on this reform program if i t i s taken as a whole. Some successes have occurred ( i ) in the transport sector, where independent regulators have been established, which i t i s hoped
w i l l create the basis for greater private investment, ( i i ) in the financial sector, where spreads have decreased somewhat (although they remain extremely high b y international standards) and where the financial safety net and supervisory role o f the Central Bank have been strengthened, ( i i i ) in corporate governance, where a new corporate law was passed in 2001 and new legislation for the stock market was passed
in 1999, (iv) in large-scale agriculture, which has expanded on the back o f innovations provided b y the
national agricultural research institute (Embrapa), and (v) in science and technology, where some grant
funding has been made competitive (supported b y a Bank loan). But such progress pales in comparison
with the agenda needed to return Brazil to a high growth path.
Meanwhile, several key areas have shown patchy progress:

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

81

The move towards a rationalized multi-modal regional transport network has been slower than
hoped (reflected in non-declining logistics costs) and few additions have been made to urban
transport systems;
Energy reform has stalled after an effective rationing response to the 2001 crisis (supported by
the 2001 Energy Reform Loan, since which progress has waned);
Competition policy and i t s application did not alter appreciably during the CAS period (although
there are now new initiatives here);
Financial sector competition has not increased and credit i s s t i l l dominated b y the public sector (a
factor which international research associates with l o w growth);28
Access to higher education has remained very limited, despite spending o n the sector that i s extremely high by any international standards.

b)

Bank Contribution

While the 2000 CAS identified growth as a priority and recognized the inter-linkage between
growth and stability, the program during the CAS period has been relatively light in this area owing to a
combination o f other priorities and fiscal and institutional impediments.
One exception has been a successful pair of programmatic adjustment loans, based on a dialogue
with the government focusing on financial sector supervision, the strengthening o f inflation targeting and
other functions of the Central Bank, and the privatization o f some remaining state banks. The Bank also
responded to a government request for advice on growth-generating policies with E S W disseminated in
2001, which was well re~eived.~’
In addition, the Bank responded to the 2001 energy crisis with intensive advice, TA, and a singletranche energy-sector adjustment loan. This loan was successful in supporting the immediate response to
the 2001 crisis, and although the subsequent lack of reform progress in the sector has been disappointing
(and may yet prove a constraint to growth again), i t does not imply that the rationale o f encouraging and
improving possible subsequent reforms was wrong ex ante.

Lending and TA have continued through the Bank’s existing activities in the transport sector, although here new lending has been limited by fiscal constraints. New projects in the CAS period were
GoiBs Highways and SFio Paulo Metro Line 4.30With regard to the second of these, a large component o f
the Bank’s outstanding investment portfolio - $859m at the time of writing - resides in urban transport.
One o f the goals of this set o f loans was to encourage the decentralization o f the regulation o f this sector,
which has happened only selectively.
Much o f this work may now flow into a new programmatic series o f policy reform loans for the
growth agenda, which w i l l program amalgamate the reform agenda in several key areas: logistics costs,
infrastructure regulation, administrative barriers to investment and innovation, trade and increased competition, and financial-sector deepening.
A recent IMF working paper by Belaisch found that the lack o f competition in the Brazilian financial sector contributes to high spreads.
29 “Brazil: The New Growth Agenda,” 2002, Report No. 22950-BR.
30 Existing projects were Federal Highways, Rio Grande do Sul Highways, and urban transport projects in Recife,
Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.

82

Reflecting the conclusions o f the CAE, the problem that the Bank program has faced has been
less the correct identification of priorities than the ability to influence performance significantly through
the Bank’s array o f instruments. The Bank did try repeatedly to lend greater support t o regulatory reforms
and succeeded in some instances (e.g., the transport and water sectors), but has never gained the traction
hoped for across the board. In the infrastructure sectors, limited federal and state investment has curtailed
the potential for Bank investment operations to provide finance-based support to key regulatory reforms.
In energy, where some federal investment has continued, the Government has been reluctant to use Bank
financing. It should be noted that given Brazil’s strong system o f fiscal management, Bank financing to
sectors i s not “additional” - i t s value therefore comes mainly from protecting government priority projects over time and by providing technical support. These advantages must outweigh other “costs o f doing
business” with the Bank that the government may perceive as disincentives in a g i v e n sector.
Relevant also for judging the Bank’s contribution, Brazil’s growth performance should be put
into perspective. There i s no doubt that regulatory barriers are significant, nor about the impact o f financial and macroeconomic imbalances, but Brazilian growth rates have not been l o w e r in recent years than
those for the region as a whole, and with progress on some o f the reform fronts described in this section,
Brazil could quickly return to GDP growth in the range o f 4 to 5 percent. Making t h i s a reality i s now a
central priority o f the Bank’s assistance strategy.
Finally, the growth agenda i s marked b y i t s cross-cutting incidence across t h e many spheres that
influence private sector decisions and performance. The reform program therefore involves a long l i s t o f
ministries, agencies, and individuals, and a high number o f legislative bills. Progress can be slow. In particular, to manage expectations and country relations, i t w i l l be vital for the Bank t o assess realistically
the ability o f the Executive to effect congressional passage o f the many reform b i l l s that make up the
growth agenda. Crucial in this context i s one conclusion from Bank experience w i t h programmatic lending during this CAS period: to maintain reform momentum i t i s best to define loan programs across a
wide front. This allows the Bank to maintain a constructive dialogue in all key areas while rewarding reforms in due accordance with the political and social constraints faced by the government and the legislature.
Pillar 4: Development Effectiveness
a)

Country Progress

Pillar 4 o f the 2000 CAS emphasized the need to strengthen public sector management: judicial
reform, economic decision-making in the states, and institutional capacity in the municipalities (Brazil’s
more than 5500 municipalities are responsible for delivering many basic services i n c l u d i n g primary education, some health services, basic sanitation, and many transfers such as Fome Zero and Bolsa Escola).
As mentioned earlier, the 2000 CAS differed from the 2000 PPA in making this theme explicit,
and the discussion in the CAS pointed out that Brazil was an intermediate performer by international
comparison on most measures o f governance, such as public participation, p o l i t i c a l instability and violence, government effectiveness, and regulatory burden. Moreover, important improvements in institutional capacity at the federal level and in transparency throughout government w e r e at the time either recent (such as public procurement and financial control systems) or incipient (the Fiscal Responsibility
Law was at the time s t i l l only a proposal). The implementation and consolidation o f these reforms represents real progress.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

83

An area highlighted in the 2000 CAS, where much-needed progress has been absent, i s judicial
reform. Contract enforceability, consistency o f judicial decisions, and time delays remain serious obstacles both to economic activity and to fairness o f outcomes in Brazil.
In connection with this observation, i t would be wrong to place much o f the blame for recent increases in crime and violence in Brazil at the door o f the judiciary, although impunity through lengthy
court delays and byzantine procedures i s probably a contributing factor. Increases in urban violent crime
in particular have been alarming. In 1999, Brazil’s homicide rate was 26 per 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 12 in 1980, and more recently this rate has not decreased. Violence i s highest in the Southeast
region, particularly the states o f Rio de Janeiro (with a homicide rate o f 53 in 1999) and S2io Paulo (44),
and homicide rates are above 60 in the cities o f Recife, R i o de Janeiro, S2io Paulo, and Vit6ria. Residents
o f smaller peripheral slums are exposed to the highest homicide rates. Much o f this crime i s related to the
drug trade, particularly in urban slums, where the authorities have in places virtually relinquished control
to organized gangs. The solutions are complex, and involve coordinated improvements in community policing, prisons, and judicial processes, along with community level initiatives focusing on at-risk young
males.

Overall, Brazilian institutional strengthening has been slowly consolidated over the 2000-2003
CAS period. With the exception o f judicial and crime-related policies, progress has been most noticeable
at the federal level and in certain states - municipal strengthening i s s t i l l recognized by the Government
as a key challenge to improve service delivery.

b)

Bank Contribution

Despite the separation o f governance as a separate theme in i t s conceptual framework, the 2000
CAS did not lead to a heavy concentration o f Bank activities in this area. This was anticipated in the
CAS, which emphasized an emerging but demand-driven approach with a leaning towards ESW, grant
funded activities, and other non-lending services. Components of state lending in Cear6 and Bahia focused on municipal and state capacity, and state economic memoranda in six northeastern states31 gave
broad policy advice to state governments, but the lending operations hinted at in the 2000 CAS (e&, an
urban reform APL supporting municipal management) did not take place (and indeed had been withdrawn
b y the 2001 progress report). At the federal level the Bank completed ESW on the government’s multiyear planning process3’ and gave technical advice in the judicial area, starting with workshops and progressing to ESW - work on justice continues, an important investment in knowledge for the new CAS
period. At the municipal level, the WBI provided advice to the municipality o f S2io Paulo on anticorruption measures.
Despite these activities, i t i s apparent that the Bank‘s program did not really offer intensive support in public governance, beyond the effects implicit in ongoing Bank operations (transparency in procurement, fiduciary oversight, etc.). This i s not inconsistent with the cautious approach adopted, to pilot a
few small activities, but the choice to treat this dimension separately in the 2000 CAS may have placed an
emphasis out o f proportion with the ensuing Bank support.
Pillar 5: Environmentaland Natural Resource Management
a)

Country Progress

The 2000 CAS divided this pillar into three themes:
31

32

Cearfi, Pernambuco, Bahia, Piaui, MaranhZo, Rio Grande do Norte.
“Brazil: Planning for Performance in the Federal Government,” Report No. 22870-BR.

84

1. Natural resource management, including water, forests, and land;
2. Environmental protection and management, including increasing protected areas, mainstreaming
air and water quality in other sector decisions, the creation o f stronger licensing, monitoring, and
enforcement mechanisms, and building stakeholder coalitions around environmental assets;

3. Global environmental externalities, including carbon sequestration and biodiversity.
Progress on all three areas has been most marked in terms o f building laws and institutions. Conversely, the greatest remaining challenges are in implementing these structural reforms o n the ground.

On natural resource management, key steps were the new water law, the creation o f the water
regulator (ANA), and the execution of micro-basin level systems o f soil management in southern Brazil.
Implementation o f the water law has been slow, however.
Similarly, on environmental protection, an important law was passed in 2002 defining national
units o f c o n ~ e r v a t i o n ,85
~ ~percent of indigenous lands were demarcated, and environmentally protected
land increased. The 1999 environmental crimes law was applied to fine Petrobras $25 million after an o i l
spill, and this law has improved enforcement o f forest-clearing rules (the states o f Acre and Mato Grosso
have used GPS and satellite imagery for this). The National Forest Program aims t o set aside 14 percent
o f the Amazon as designated National Forests, where logging companies would bid for concessions to
produce under public supervision, while the Amazon Rainforest Protection Act (ARPA), signed b y the
President at the Johannesburg summit, protects 10 percent of the Legal Amazon. On global public goods,
the Plantar charcoal production site in the state o f Minas Gerais became the first purchase made under the
prototype carbon fund, and the donor-funded Pilot Program for the Protection o f the Rainforest was
strengthened.
Despite these achievements, however, deforestation rates in the last two years have increased significantly, underlining the challenge o f monitoring and enforcement o f the new rules. Institutional capaci t y remains weak in environmental protection, and many activities still rely on donor leadership.

b)

Bank Contribution

In this pillar the 2000 CAS emphasized water resource management (particularly in the Northeast
region), good practice in soil conservation and land management through micro-basin management projects, grant-funded ecosystem protection through partnership in the Global Environment Facility (GEF,
particularly in Amazonia), and - where possible - international resource transfers t o protect international
environmental public goods. As mentioned above, in most areas progress was faster on setting up laws
and institutions than on implementation. Nonetheless, it i s striking that the Bank has been involved in
nearly all o f the present initiatives to build institutions, and continues to be involved on the ground in trying to improve execution.

On water resource management, ProAgua has contributed to developing a new management approach in Northeast Brazil, while the Bank helped in the design of the Guarani aquifer project (coordinating Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina in mapping the aquifer and defining user rights). State-level
water resource management projects are underway in Bahia (already ongoing in 2000) and Cear6 (new
during the CAS period). Sector work has also supported the development o f Brazil’s new model o f water

85

resource management. The Bank has supported micro-basin level soil management with existing projects
in ParanA (under the GEF) and Rio Grande do Sul, and new projects in Santa Catarina and Sslo Paulo. A
new forestry loan i s under preparation after lengthy consultations and sector
Through partnership in donor-funded ecosystem protection the Bank helped advance environmental management in Brazil’s threatened biomes. Incorporating 50 million hectares o f primary Amazon
forest into strictly protected and sustainable use reserves i s the goal of the Amazon Protected Areas Project (ARPA), funded by the GEF. The second National Environmental Project supports institutional
strengthening o f Brazil’s environmental protection agencies.

The Bank closed two projects towards the end o f the CAS period - Prodeagro in Mato Grosso
and PlanafZoro in RondGnia - that illustrate the intricacy o f sustainable institutional solutions in environmental management and the Bank’s correspondingly mixed track record on this in Brazil. I t i s important
to mention these projects not only because they were still active in the CAS period, but more importantly
because their lessons strongly influence the Bank’s present cautious approach. The projects aimed to help
“manage the development and protection o f the Amazon basin in RondGnia” and “implement an improved
strategy for natural resource management, conservation, environmental protection, and sustainable development o f the state o f Mato Grosso” b y developing land-use zoning in the two states (where the Bank had
received criticism for previous lending for road construction). Recent Implementation Completion Reports for the two projects found that their zoning laws failed to take into account sufficiently the interests
o f many stakeholders in the Amazonian frontier, and that the zoning was largely ignored b y private
agents.35The projects serve as a warning against overly technical, top-down attempts to control natural
resource use. While acknowledging their disappointing results, i t should be noted that these projects were
in the tail-end o f execution in the last CAS period, and have therefore not been given much weighting in
assessing the Bank’s 2000-2003 environmental activities.
Overall, although Brazil’s progress on environmental and natural resource management has been
gradual relative to the importance of the area and the to the challenges present, the Bank has been active
in many o f the areas where the country has made significant institutional changes. This suggests both a
vindication o f the Bank’s approach in the last CAS period and a careful but significant scaling up o f the
Bank’s activities in these areas - in part through their integration with other areas o f Bank support - with
the focus on building the institutional capacity to execute newly formed policies and to enforce new laws
and regulations.

PARTC - BANKPERFORMANCE
This section reports on Bank performance measured b y the Bank’s own internal pe$ormance indicators at the level of the lending project or the sector study, produced both b y the Quality Assessment
Group (QAG), which assesses the quality o f economic and sector work and the “quality at entry” and
“quality o f supervision’’ o f ongoing lending operations, and the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), which assesses closed lending operations (in addition to conducting the CAE over a longer time
horizon).

LENDING
OPERATIONS
Closed Bank lending operations to Brazil for the period 1995-2002 have received generally favorable ratings from OED, with 91 percent assessed as satisfactory versus 78 percent for the L A C region
and 72 percent for the Bank. OED also breaks down its ratings into components o n the sustainability o f
34
35

“Brazil: The Causes of Deforestation,” forthcoming.
Reports Nos. 26080-BR and 26081-BR. Both were rated as unsatisfactory.

86

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

impact and impact on institutional development. On these aspects Brazil also compares favorably with the
Bank more broadly. O f projects that closed in 1995-2002, 81 percent had their sustainability rated as
likely, compared with 64 percent for L A C and 55 percent for the Bank. O f the same group, 67 percent
were rated with substantial impact on institutions, versus 45 percent for L A C and 39 percent for the Bank.
Q A G ratings are consistent with OED assessments. All Brazil projects assessed for 1996-2002
were rated satisfactory at entry (versus 98 percent for LAC and 87 percent for the Bank) while 86 percent
were rated as satisfactorily supervised (versus 78 percent for L A C and 77 percent for the Bank). For the
original CAS period 2000-2002, the proportion o f Bank projects at risk has been about the same as the
region and the Bank.36

Economic and Sector Work (ESW)
B y the Bank’s own measures, the Brazil program o f ESW has also fared well. The C A E reports
that all ESW that was rated by Q A G in the period 1996-2002 was rated as satisfactory (although one report has since received a marginally satisfactory rating), versus 82 percent for the region and 81 percent
Bank wide. The C A E echoed the Q A G finding on quality, but found that insufficient dissemination had
limited the impact of the studies.
This last finding was partly based on consultation with the last Federal Government (1998-2002)
and i s being taken most seriously by the country team in the design o f present and future ESW. OED also
reported that government officials noted that some ESW responded to informal requests from sector ministries, who sometimes showed limited interest in final review, diminishing policy impact. These observations have already led to procedural changes agreed between the Bank and the Government relating to
sponsorship and work monitoring. On the positive side, officials have indicated that the Bank has been
government’s favored multilateral partner for technical advice, and has an important role informing society about long-term structural issues, solutions, and tradeoffs. Finally, dissemination efforts did increase
during the past CAS period, with Development Forums in Brazil in 2000 and 2001, and an intensive effort to share the findings o f the Policy Notes with government and society in late 2002 and early 2003.
The Bank also increased i t s AAA partnerships in the last CAS period and translated more reports into
Portuguese. There i s probably s t i l l room for further improvement in these dimensions.
PART D

- OVERALL CONCLUSION AND LESSONS

Country performance has been strongest in the social sectors, with progress on education, health,
and social protection. Bank support here has been most effective in health (including Vigisus and the new
Family Health Extension Project) and education (including state level projects and Fundescola). Country
performance has also been strong on fiscal management, where Bank support through programmatic policy-based lending and technical assistance has also been effective, although here there has been less progress on improving the impact o f government spending though efficiency improvements.
Brazil’s weak growth, notwithstanding external shocks, i s traceable to lack o f progress and clarity in the
regulatory environment, to low public and private investment in infrastructure, and to an inefficient, public-sector dominated financial system. Bank performance has been good in places: adjustment lending and
TA in the financial sector and the energy sector were notable, and lending and AAA has been judged of
good quality. But overall the program has failed to mobilize growth-generating reforms at an adequate
pace.

36 The fraction of projects “at risk” i s a double-edged sword. A zero percent at-risk ratio could arguably be interpreted as a sign o f an overly cautious management approach.

87

Public institutional capacity remains a constraint, and in the 2000-2003 CAS period the Bank
made little headway in building i t s activities to a sufficient scale to see impact. Judicial reform i s an area
where the Bank’s program may be laying the groundwork for future improvements, although i t i s too
early to make this judgment. In the next CAS period, quality of spending and public sector management
reforms w i l l take a place closer to center stage. It should be noted that the last CAS took a cautious approach to defining the Bank’s role in governance and did not promise a large array of activities: nonetheless, the emphasis o f this pillar in the CAS suggests that the Bank hoped to play a greater role.
Similarly, country progress on environmental management has been directed more at institution
building than at execution on the ground, and the Bank’s impact, although measurable in the areas where
i t has focused, remains small in relation to the order of the challenges. The Bank’s approach has also been
cautious in this area, partly in the absence o f stronger demand from government. However, demand has
begun to increase, which would provide vindication for the Bank’s approach of constituency building and
selective piloting in the last CAS period. Moreover, the Bank’s contribution has been significant in those
spheres where country progress on natural resources and the environment has been fastest.

A notable feature of the 2000-2003 CAS period has been the introduction in Brazil o f programmatic policy-based lending. These loans have proven effective in maintaining intensive dialogues on f i s cal, financial, and growth policies. Government has indicated satisfaction with the flexibility of the instrument. One conclusion from the experience since 2001 i s the importance o f combining a broad definition of the reform program with single-tranching within each program. This provides flexibility but therefore heightens the role o f Bank management in judging likely reform significance and effectiveness. Braz i l i s moving onto a complex, wide-ranging, second-generation reform agenda within a decentralized federation. This w i l l call for the Bank’s assessment o f a correspondingly broad range of measures for social
progress and poverty reduction. Legislative progress w i l l be harder to define ex ante than in the case o f a
narrower definition o f a few structural measures that may have characterized past lending. This increases
the gains from a flexible approach and wide program definition.
The past CAS period was also a period o f increasing World Bank Group physical presence in
Brazil, with expansion in Brasflia, a new office in Fortaleza, a continued IBRD presence in Recife, and
IFC offices in Rio de Janeiro and S8o Paulo. Government feedback has indicated a strong positive effect
on the Bank’s responsiveness, a sentiment that corroborates the impressions already held by Bank staff,
Overall this report judges that the Bank made a significant contribution to Brazilian development in 20002003, particularly in the first two pillars, where the CAS promised to focus the Bank’s efforts and resources. This conclusion i s consonant with the findings o f the recent CAE (1990-2002). Increased strategic focus on the Northeast and on the relationship with the states have paid dividends, as has continued
acknowledgement of the central role o f fiscal management in Brazil today. The harder issues o f detailed
public spending analysis, improving the microeconomic environment for growth, building institutions to
tackle exclusion and violence, and the execution on the ground o f environmental protection are some of
the key challenges for the next CAS period.

ANNEX 3: IBRD Portfolio Performance and Challenges

BACKGROUND
IBRD’s ongoing investment lending portfolio in Brazil i s one o f the largest in the Bank, comprising 53 projects with a commitment o f US$4.5 billion, net o f cancellations as o f September 2003 (Table
l).37
The portfolio i s well-matched to Brazil’s economic development challenges and public spending
priorities and to the Bank’s comparative advantage, with a strong focus and in the areas o f poverty alleviation in both rural and urban areas, improvements in health and education quality and coverage, and
technical assistance in support of the reform agenda (e.g., social security reform at federal, state and municipal levels, institutional strengthening in the Ministry o f Environment and the Central Bank, among
others, which have had disproportionate impact given their small size). Brazil i s one o f the few countries
where sub-national governments can borrow directly; about half o f the portfolio supports development
activities in most o f Brazil’s 27 states, primarily in the arid Northeast, center o f the largest share o f rural
poverty; and in the urban Southeast, locus of most urban poverty.

Portfolio performance improved substantially during second half of the 1990s (early to mid-1990s
performance was poor), in the context o f macroeconomic adjustment and a specific portfolio “clean-up”
initiative taken by the government and the Bank. Since then performance has been relatively consistently
in the higher category o f performers Bank-wide, as measured by OED impact evaluations, and on the basis o f ongoing performance monitoring through the PSR system. For example, the percentage o f problem
projects has not exceeded 10 percent o f the portfolio, and proactivity has been at o r near 100 percent, indicating that when problems do arise, Bank clients and staff have been quick to take action. As o f September 20, there were four problems projects in the portfolio, or about 7 percent o f total projects and 8
percent o f total commitments, and proactivity remained at 100 percent, comparing favorably with regional and Bank averages.

54 projects and US$4.9 billion as o f end-FY03.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES

There are three inter-linked sets of implementation challenges the country team faces in pursuing
the program outlined in the present CAS.
0

First, confronting the operational challenges o f extremely limited fiscal space, at federal, state
and local levels, which have implications for both the ongoing portfolio and the new lending program and leads towards greater programmatic approach to lending.

Second, working with our clients to further strengthen government implementation systems, at
both federal and sub-national level, in the context o f more programmatic, systemic lending support which i s less individual transaction-oriented.

Third, in the context o f greater results-focus and the programmatic lending strategy, placing
greater emphasis on better monitoring and evaluation. This includes both helping clients build
better monitoring and evaluation systems and management capacity but also establishing within
the Bank country team a monitoring and evaluation culture that brings project and program specific achievements in the context o f reaching Brazil’s broader development goals.
1. The Operational Challenges of Limited Fiscal Space
The pace o f loan disbursements has slowed markedly over the course o f the last two to three
years - due to chronically inadequate budgetary resources for timely implementation at both federal and
state level - highlighting a crucial underlying risk factor in the portfolio. The disbursement ratio at end
FY03 reach just 12 percent (amount disbursed during the year divided by balance outstanding at the start
o f the year), substantially below historic performance levels (Table 2) and below regional and Bank averages. Twelve projects (23 percent) have triggered the slow-disbursing flag; and 7 (13 percent) carry the
financial performance flag. In light of this issue, the Brazil management team has placed 20 projects
(nearly half the portfolio) on a formal “watch l i s t ” reflecting the enhanced level o f risk related to financial
performance. In the absence o f improvement, the number o f problem projects could increase significant1y .

Chronic lack o f budget resources i s due primarily to the effects o f Brazil’s ambitious fiscal adjustment program. Fiscal measures since the late 1990s, while positive overall, have resulted in substantially reduced fiscal space for public investments. Recent budget cuts to meet primary surplus targets

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

97

combined with significant Constitutionally-mandated earmarking of expenditures leave little room for
discretionary investment spending. Moreover, IF1 lending has since 1999 been effectively treated as a
regular budget expenditure item, subject to overall fiscal targets and constraints. Previously, IF1funding
had de-facto been considered additional to the budget. These necessary and healthy measures have l e d to
reduced budgetary space (affecting both the budget line item for Bank financing as well as the line item
for counterpart funding - a broader problem than traditionally highlighted in the financial performance
flag as “lack o f counterpart funds”). Budget execution rigidities identified in the recent (2002) Country
Financial Assessment, which include periodic budget, freezes and a fragmented system, which makes difficult adjustment to changes in priority difficult, compound the problem. At the state level, effective implementation o f fiscal discipline through the rules consolidated in the Fiscal Responsibility Law have had
a similar effect. Finally, devaluation over the last several years has translated into larger dollardenominated loan balances than potentially needed to cover costs determined at appraisal. This i s reflected in a rather large undisbursed amount of $2.7 billion (which magnifies the effect o f slow disbursements).
The Bank has been working closely with the government, including through a recent CPPR held
jointly with the IDB - which faces the same set o f implementation challenges - t o address these issues.
Among avenues are:
a plan for partial cancellations of loan balances where fund are not needed or cannot be used in
the remaining project period. Agreement in principle has been reached to cancel an important
share o f the undisbursed amount;
close cooperation with Planning and Finance ministries to improve alignment of projects with
development and budgetary priorities in the context o f the PPA, and better forecast specific pro-

ject’s budget needs and ensure coordination with the budget planning and revision processes; and

expanded policy dialogue toward modernizing federal government budget execution rigidities
identified in the CFAA, and to be further addressed in the Financial Management Strategy (FMS),
through our public sector management policy dialogue as part of the broader fiscal programmatic
loan series and accompanying technical assistance.
Lack o f budget resources has also affected substantially the Bank’s ability t o commit new lending
commensurate with Brazil’s financial needs. This i s reflected in longer lead-time from Appraisal to
Board, in particular for sub-national borrowers. I t i s also reflected in slowing investment lending commitments in the 2000-2003 CAS period. The Bank and the government have jointly been exploring ways
to address the lack o f fiscal space. A seminar in July 2003 on “New Instruments” sought innovations that
would help address the challenge o f supporting Brazil with strategic financial and technical assistance in
the context of fiscal constraints to borrowing and spending.
While the seminar presented a variety o f possible alternatives, sector wide approaches (S WAps)
were seen as promising from the government’s point o f view as they work with existing government priority programs, use existing institutions and systems while helping strengthen them, and provide a reliable and relatively quickly-disbursing source o f funding. SWAps thus address fiscal constraints both b y
tying funding to highest priority programs and minimizing the risks o f budget cuts, while at the same time
safeguarding a dependable flow o f funds. Selective lending at sub-national level to creditworthy municipal or state governments, provided the program financed i s within the state government’s budget and
that this budget i s prepared consistent with fiscal targets agreed with the federal government, were also
considered promising, and the federal government and the Bank have agreed to develop criteria for possible lending to sub-national governments, and regularly discuss the program to ensure i t i s consistent with
overall fiscal management. Partial risk guarantees to attract the private sector were also seen as a posi-

98

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

tive potential n e w lending tool. As a result of these discussions during CAS preparation, the present CAS
sets out a lending strategy that combines programmatic adjustment lending in support o f key policy reforms with enhanced use of SWAps, in particular at federal level, as a key investment lending “platform,”
as well as a carefully-selected program of sub-national lending.

2. The Operational Challenges of Programmatic, Systemic Lending
Recent Bank and partner diagnostic work indicates Brazil has a strong institutional framework for
implementation at the national level. At the sub-national, preliminary diagnostic work suggest frameworks are likely sound but that institutional capacity varies greatly and i s generally in need o f strengthening. Brazil’s overall sound fiduciary framework, in particular at national level, forms a firm foundation
for moving forward with a program of sector wide approach projects (SWAps). As part o f the focus on
these sector-wide approaches i t w i l l be important to work with the government, at federal, state and municipal level, to continue to strengthen these already strong implementation systems. Among the elements
of a strategy building and strengthening clients systems in this context during the CAS period are the following, further discussed below:
Proactivefollow up with the relevantfederal government counterparts on the recommendations
of the recent diagnostic work, including the Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) at national level in the context o f
a Financial Management Strategy (FMS) and the action plan agreed with government in the context o f the CPAR.
Continuation and expansion of diagnostic work at sub-national level, through additional state
CPAR and CFAA work with states and a selection o f municipalities - consistent with the direction of our evolving strategies for support to these clients - combined with increased ex-post
evaluations. While the diagnostic work i s already planned and budgeted in the regional business
plan, further budgetary support for ex-post reviews i s needed.
Mainstreaming of the fiduciary strengthening agenda - including both systems modernization,
legislative reform and upgrading professional capacity - into the public sector management policy dialogue, including through the Public Expenditure Review at national level (and ongoing
similar work in a number of states) and possible technical assistance and adjustment support for
the public expenditure reform agenda;
Development of a “safeguards assessment’’ tool to help bring knowledge o f environmental and

social safeguards systems to a similar knowledge and diagnostic level as the fiduciary. This
would provide a platform for capacity and institution building, as well as ability to gauge which
government procedures and systems might warrant use in the near term; and

Continued progress on the harmonization agenda for procurement and financial management
with the LDB in the context o f ongoing collaboration on improved synergy in the programs o f the
two banks.
The Bank has undertaken a recent (2002) Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), which rated the country’s financial accountability systems and institutions as well-designed and
reliable in tracking budget expenditures with a high degree o f transparency. T h e CFAA evaluated the
systems as presenting l o w risk in terms o f use of funds. SIAFI, the government’s financial administration
system, provides a strong framework, which the government i s committed to further upgrading. However, while systems are effective in ensuring aggregate fiscal control, budget execution processes in par-

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

99

ticular were highlighted as being fragmented and in need o f simplification and modernization to better
establish and adapt to changes in priorities. In addition, the C F A A identified capacity building and audit
function areas where Brazil’s systems could be further strengthened.
Brazil i s piloting the Bank’s new Financial Management Strategy (FMS) instrument, which w i l l
further develop the recommendations of the C F A A and develop an agreed action plan with the government on priorities for further system strengthening. This would also include exploring how to make these
institutions more central to program delivery (e.g. simplified FM arrangements f o r individual projects,
processes that contribute to country capacity as well as meeting the Bank’s own internal needs, and opportunities for harmonization with other partners). F M S preparation has already helped to develop approaches for addressing operational constraints faced in light o f fiscal adjustment and budget rigidities.
At the sub-national level, an ongoing State Financial Accountability Assessment (covering the
states o f Bahia, Cear6 and Pernambuco) w i l l be completed in FY04. Preliminary findings suggest a
strong financial systems framework, but need for capacity building to ensure most efficient and effective
use o f this framework. Further financial accountability reviews at state level are planned, consistent with
the direction o f planned lending for FY05-06. A review o f selected municipal financial accountability i s
also planned for FY05.

The Bank has also recently discussed and agreed (2003) with the federal government on a Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR), which rates federal procurement systems and institutions economic, efficient and transparent, and o f (the l o w end of) average risk. The government i s placing particular emphasis on procurement reform within the broader area o f public expenditure management reform. In
the context o f the CPAR an action plan of future priorities has been agreed with the government which
could bring the system to an even greater level o f performance. These include, inter alia, revision o f the
legal framework, introduction of incentives to enhances performance of procurement staff, and establishment o f a executive-branch normative agency to issues regulations and provide guidance. Making better
use o f Brazil’s innovative e-procurement capability could also bring efficiency gains.
State procurement assessments are also completed and/or underway in Bahia, Ceara and Pernambuco. Similar to the financial assessments underway, they have found strong institutions and legislation but capacity in need of strengthening. One approach to capacity building has been in the nature o f
the diagnostic work itself, which has been done in seminar-form with a broad audience o f stakeholders,
making it a learning event. This has been well received in the three cases where i t has been undertaken.
Further procurement reviews at state level are planned, consistent with the direction o f planned lending
for FY05-06. A review o f selected municipal financial accountability i s also planned for FY05.

Already-strong financial management and procurement systems would both be further developed
in the context of public sector management policy and operational work, including joint Public Expenditure Review work. A planned Public Expenditure Management technical assistance loan could include
components addressing both improved annual budgeting and budget execution, improved predictability of
budget l i m i t s and cash management systems, greater use o f electronic government instruments (such as eprocurement) and upgrading o f professional qualifications o f public servants in these areas. State-specific
dialogue in these areas (in particular in the states o f Bahia, Ceara and Pernambuco) could also follow this
model through both existing and planned new financial and technical support.

3. The Operational Challenges of a Results-Based CAS
This CAS has established the initial framework for a results-based approach to the Bank’s program of support, closely linked to the government’s Multi-year Plan (PPA) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The CAS establishes a regular semi-annual review between the government and

loo

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Bank management that w i l l provide the basis for monitoring and evaluating performance and improving
the results framework.

To be successful, the results-based approach w i l l need to establish a clear link between country
performance and Bank operational support. This translates into the need for better baseline data and
monitoring systems in our client agencies (for which operational support i s planned in this CAS). I t also
translates into better monitoring of outcomes in the context of implementation of Bank projects, and more
frequent taking of stock on the impact of specific programs and groups o f programs. As the Bank moves
towards more programmatic and systemic lending support (including SWAps) for Brazil with this CAS,
there i s a particular opportunity to build effective monitoring and evaluation systems that help better
evaluate outcomes while also better quantifying the Bank’s particular contribution.
A results based CAS w i l l need to place more focus on evaluation culture during implementation
o f Bank operations, impact assessments, strengthening o f client monitoring systems and more systematic
monitoring o f results during implementation. Elements o f strategy to develop a closer link between project results measurement and the results-based CAS framework:
Assist clients in establishing performance monitoring and evaluation systems. This would include the federal government, through the PPA process and the Bank’s PER support, to states
through “horizontal” components, and to individual ministries through technical assistance and
other activities, grant or loan financed.
0

Development of performance-linked disbursement pilots. Among those being considered include: Bank financing linked to “production,” e.g., number o f students graduated; financing
linked to midterm measures of benchmarked performance; and variable financing (from a “base”
to a “high” rate) depending on targeting and monitoring systems improvements.
Systematic attention to results framework and monitoring in the context of project preparation
(Decision Meetings to review in particular link o f project logframe and monitoring system to results-framework in CAS)
Regular reporting during implementation on results monitoring through supervision reports, in
the context of relevance to broader CAS objectives spelled out in the results matrices and the

longer-term goals table.
0

Portfolio performance indicators to be broadened to include progress towards achieving development objectives in the context o f Brazil’s medium-term outcomes and longer-term goals as established in the CAS and through semi-annual review with government.
Joint government and Bank learning in results measurement and monitoring, e.g., including a

training event and a seminar to share international experiences for early calendar 2004.

ANNEX 4: Poverty Trends in the 1990s

Since 1997, poverty levels have remained relatively stable but the poverty profile has changed
significantly. Despite the series of adverse macroeconomic shocks that reduced the growth rate of the
Brazilian economy over this period, the overall poverty rate did not rise, hovering at the 28 - 29 percent
level. The stability o f the poverty rate resulted from the combination o f a fall in rural poverty and a rise in
urban poverty. Similarly, there was a fall in poverty rates in the North and Northeast, and a rise in poverty
rates in the Southeast and Center West.
The effect o f the economic downturn was concentrated in metropolitan areas; i t resulted in high
unemployment and a permanent fall in labor income in the industrial sectors that could be associated with
the increase in urban poverty. Also, exchange rate devaluation negatively affected service sector prices,
harming the poor and urban workers the most. As a result, poverty levels in metropolitan areas, especially the metropolitan periphery of the Southeast region, rose substantially.
Conversely, rural areas were less affected by slowing growth and the macroeconomic volatility,
with the poorest populations somewhat sheltered. Additionally, improvements in Brazilian social policy
led to a wider and more efficient social safety net, and broader access o f the poor to public goods and services alleviated the impact o f the crisis on the poorest.
The combination o f the urban nature o f the impact o f the economic crisis and the ability o f government policies to protect the poor in the rural Northeast led to a significant change in the Brazilian poverty profile. It i s clear that the incidence o f poverty in rural areas and in the Northeast region continues to
be high; however the increasing poverty trends in metropolitan areas are more worrying and call for a
change in the poverty reduction strategy. The broader repercussion o f the problems associated with the
increasing metropolitan poverty, expressed in the recent spike in urban violence and in higher unemployment, suggest that a stronger focus on metropolitan poverty reduction i s needed.
This annex contents five parts. The first describes the trend o f poverty levels in the nineties, focusing on the period 1997-2001. The second analyses the change in the poverty profile during the period
1998 to 2001. The third part describes the role of social policy in the alleviation o f the effects o f the crisis
in recent years. The fourth part reports the results o f the incidence analysis o f education, sanitation and
public goods provided b y the government, clearly showing that the access o f the poor to public services
was broadened. Finally, the last section summarizes the main findings and suggests policy options.
POVERTY TRENDS
IN THE NINETIES
AND THE METROPOLITAN
CRISIS OF 1997-2001

The evolution o f poverty in Brazil in the last decade can be divided into three phases: i)the peaking o f poverty levels in the early nineties reaching 36 percent in 1992/93, due to the high inflation and
macroeconomic volatility; ii)the strong reduction in poverty levels from 1994, attaining 29.8 percent
in1996, resulting from the end of the inflationary period and the resumption o f growth promoted b y the
price and general macroeconomic stability; and iii)a relatively stable poverty rate o f 29-30 percent over

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

102

the last five years in a very difficult macroeconomic situation characterized b y a series o f adverse shocks
that caused a slowdown in GDP growth and high volatility (see figure

u3'.

The relative stability of poverty in a context o f high economic volatility and l o w growth during
the 1997-2002 period contrasts with the significant change in the poverty profile that occurred in these
years. The stronger impact of the economic crisis in metropolitan areas produced a change in the poverty
profile, and the improvement in social policy prevented the worsening of poverty.
Since 1997 the Brazilian economy has suffered macroeconomic shocks that resulted in a sharp
slowdown in GDP growth and interrupted the poverty reduction trend caused b y the economic stabilization in 1994. The effect of this economic downturn has been concentrated in metropolitan areas and was
expressed in high unemployment and the permanent fall o f labor income in these areas. The unemployment rate rose from 6.9 percent in 1996 to 9.6 percent in 2001. Per capita income f e l l by 1.8 percent in
metropolitan areas during the period 1996-2001. As a result, figure 1 shows that metropolitan poverty
grew from 17 percent in 1998 to 20 percent in 2001, and urban poverty rose from 24 percent to 26 percent
between 1996 and 2001.39
Data from PME that covers only the biggest six metropolitan areas, and includes only labor income, shows a more dramatic picture: poverty levels in the metropolitan areas experienced a sharp increase from 26 percent in 1998 to 29 percent in 2001. The metropolitan areas o f the Southeast, especially
in the metropolitan periphery, were the most affected areas. Rio de Janeiro metropolitan poverty grew
from 26 percent to 3 1 percent while SZo Paul0 metropolitan poverty increased f r o m 2 1 percent to 25 percent between 1998 and 2001.
As a consequence, poverty in the Southeast regions rose from 15 percent in 1998 to 17 percent in
2001, while poverty f e l l from 54 percent to 53 percent in the Northeast and from 39 percent to 37 percent
in the North between 1998 and 2001.
Due to i t s stronger impact in urban areas, the negative effects o f the GDP slowdown mainly affected the groups positioned in the middle of the Brazilian income distribution. Between 1997 and 2001,
the income o f the richest 10 percent o f the population decreased b y 0.7 percent per year, and the income
of the poorest 50 percent experienced an increase o f 0.8 percent. The rest of the population experienced
an annual income decrease of 1.1 percent.
Since rural areas were not as affected by the high macroeconomic volatility and the l o w growth,
the poverty rate in rural areas fell from 57 in 1996/97 t o 54 percent in 2001. Additionally, a series o f
measures implemented by the federal government, that will be described below, smoothed the effect o f
the macroeconomic crisis on the rural populations, especially in the Northeast and North regions. In this
sense, the economic downturn o f the last years did not hurt the poorest groups o f population.

~

~

Brazil does not have an official poverty line and research institutions use different poverty lines that lead to different numbers on poverty. The poverty line used in the study was established at around R$80 in SBo Paulo (metropolitan area) prices o f July 2001, and adjusted for each region using a regional price index based on the consumption
profile o f the population group with incomes between the lowest quintile and the median of the income distribution.
This value i s close to that selected by the Fome Zero program and to the eligibility poverty level for the Alvorada
project, making this analysis useful for practical purposes. I t i s based on the criterion that each person must consume
at least 2288 calories per day (the minimum level required for adequate nutrition, according to WHO). In the previous CAS, the poverty rate was lower, because housing imputed rent was included in the calculation for income; in
the present CAS, housing imputed rent i s not included.
39 The structural reform agenda also adversely affected some groups in metropolitan areas. For example, the openness of the economy affected blue collar worker from SBo Paulo, the privatization o f state enterprises affected public
workers from Rio de Janeiro, etc.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

The relative stability of poverty in a context o f high economic volatility and l o w growth during
the 1997-2002 period contrasts with the significant change in the poverty profile that occurred in these
years. The stronger impact of the economic crisis in metropolitan areas produced a change in the poverty
profile, and the improvement in social policy prevented the worsening o f poverty.

Since 1997 the Brazilian economy has suffered macroeconomic shocks that resulted in a sharp
slowdown in GDP growth and interrupted the poverty reduction trend caused by the economic stabilization in 1994. The effect of this economic downturn has been concentrated in metropolitan areas and was
expressed in high unemployment and the permanent fall o f labor income in these areas. The unemployment rate rose f r o m 6.9 percent in 1996 to 9.6 percent in 2001. Per capita income f e l l by 1.8 percent in
metropolitan areas during the period 1996-2001. As a result, figure 1 shows that metropolitan poverty
grew from 17 percent in 1998 to 20 percent in 2001, and urban poverty rose from 24 percent to 26 percent
between 1996 and 2001.4'
Data f r o m PME that covers only the biggest six metropolitan areas, and includes only labor income, shows a more dramatic picture: poverty levels in the metropolitan areas experienced a sharp increase from 26 percent in 1998 to 29 percent in 2001. The metropolitan areas of the Southeast, especially
in the metropolitan periphery, were the most affected areas. Rio de Janeiro metropolitan poverty grew
from 26 percent to 3 1 percent while SBo Paulo metropolitan poverty increased f r o m 21 percent to 25 percent between 1998 and 2001.
As a consequence, poverty in the Southeast regions rose from 15 percent in 1998 to 17 percent in
2001, while poverty fell from 54 percent to 53 percent in the Northeast and from 39 percent to 37 percent
in the North between 1998 and 2001.
Due to i t s stronger impact in urban areas, the negative effects o f the GDP slowdown mainly affected the groups positioned in the middle of the Brazilian income distribution. Between 1997 and 2001,
the income o f the richest 10 percent o f the population decreased by 0.7 percent per year, and the income
o f the poorest 50 percent experienced an increase o f 0.8 percent. The rest o f the population experienced
an annual income decrease of 1.1 percent.

Since rural areas were not as affected by the high macroeconomic volatility and the l o w growth, the
poverty rate in rural areas f e l l from 57 in 1996/97 to 54 percent in 2001. Additionally, a series o f measures implemented b y the federal government, that w i l l be described below, smoothed the effect o f the
macroeconomic crisis on the rural populations, especially in the Northeast and North regions. In this
sense, the economic downturn o f the last years did not hurt the poorest groups o f population.

THE CHANGE IN THE POVERTY PROFILE
As mentioned above, the urban nature of the economic crisis o f the last few years led to a significant change in the poverty profile. The incidence o f poverty continues to be greater in rural areas, but the
evolution o f poverty in metropolitan areas increased the share o f the total poor in urban areas in overall
poverty. Table 1 shows that in 1998, metropolitan and urban poor represented, respectively, 18 percent
and 43 percent o f the Brazilian poor. In 2001, metropolitan and urban poor respectively represented 22
percent and 48 percent o f overall poor. The rural poor reduced their share o f the total poor from 39 percent in 1998 to 36 percent in 2001.

The structural reform agenda also adversely affected some groups in metropolitan areas. For example, the openness o f the economy affected blue collar worker from SBo Paulo, the privatization of state enterprises affected public
workers from Rio de Janeiro, etc.

Comparing the poverty profiles of 1998 and 2001, one observes other important changes. First,
there i s a regional change in the poverty profile, with the share o f the Northeast (of total poor) reduced
from 55 percent in 1998 to 52 percent in 2001, and with the share in the Southeast rising from 24 percent
in 1998 to 26 percent in 200141.
Poverty incidence increased among youth with the increased contribution o f young people to
overall poverty. Poverty in people under 25 increased from 36 percent in 1998 to 3 9 percent in 2001. For
people between 25 and 44 years o f age, poverty increased from 31 percent in 1998 t o 33 percent in 2001,
while poverty among people older than 65 fell from 19 percent in 1998 to 16 percent in 2001. Thus, the
face o f the average poor person i s younger in 2001 than in 1998, as the share o f people under 45 years of
age in overall poverty grew from 58 percent to 62 percent.

The poverty rate among people without education or with 1 year o f education fell from 53 percent
to 5 1 percent, while i t grew in all the other educational subgroups. The contribution o f people with 1 year
or less o f education in total poverty fell from 38 percent to 33 percent between 1998 and 2001. The greatest worsening in poverty occurred in the intermediary educational groups with 1 to 8 years of education
whose poverty rates increased b y 4 percentage points over the 1998-2001 period. As a consequence, the
relationship between education and poverty was weakened.
Regarding labor status, the significant increase in poverty among unemployed people rose from
58 in 1998 percent to 64 percent in 2001, reflecting another urban crisis. Also, in 2001, informal-sector
employees were poorer (45 percent) than in 1998 (42 percent). As a result, the share o f unemployed and
informal workers’ poverty in overall poverty increased from 6 percent to 8 percent and from 19 percent to
21 percent, respectively.
The poverty profile, when viewed by type o f economic activity, also shows a greater degree o f
poverty worsening in sectors concentrated in urban areas. C i v i l construction and services were the sectors
where poverty increased, while poverty in agriculture activities was reduced. Between 1998 and 2001,
poverty incidence in the construction sector grew from 29 percent to 31 percent, and in services f r o m 18
percent to 20 percent. In agriculture, the poverty rate fell from 56 percent to 54 percent while poverty in
the industrial sector was stable at 21 percent. As a consequence, the contribution o f agriculture to overall
poverty fell from 36 percent to 3 1 percent.

Another evidence of the metropolitan crisis comes from the migratory flows which tend to react when faced with
economic and social changes, becoming a good measurement o f the relative attraction of several locations. Historically, the non-immigrant status in Brazil tends to increase as we move from large cities towards less densely populated areas. For example, in 2001 the percentage o f the native population was 75.1% in metropolitan areas and
84.9% in rural areas. This migration flow was mostly directed from the Northeast region to the Southeast region.
However, the comparison of more recent migration flows occurring show that in the south-east 0.39% migrated less
than one year before 2001 while the same statistics for the northeast reached 1.06%.

GROWTH,
INCOME REDISTRIBUTION AND POVERTY SCENARIOS
Let us look at a few scenarios useful in the evaluation o f poverty alleviation targets, applying
standard Ravallion-type techniques o f decomposition o f poverty, between growth and inequality components, at a National level.
The proportion o f poor in Brazil would drop from the current 28.7 percent observed in 2001 to
23.6 percent, if per capita national income grew 5 percent per annum, for four consecutive years. That
means that nearly nine million Brazilians would cross the poverty line in the next few years. But the true
social miracle would happen if all this growth came concurrently with a reduction in inequality. I f the
assumed accumulated economic expansion o f 21.6 percent were to be combined with a drop o f 8.5 percent in the Gini coefficient4*, the poverty rate in Brazil would decrease to nearly h a l f o f i t s initial value
(39.7 percent), reaching a value o f 17.3 percent. This would result in the original level of 48,824 million
poor people being reduced in number to 29,427 million.
In reality, poverty could experience a substantial decrease, even if the country does not grow over
the course o f the next five years. The 8.5 percent reduction in the Gini index alone would reduce the proportion o f indigents by 8.3 percentage points, as compared to 5.1 percentage points that could be achieved
in the previously mentioned 21.6 percent pure growth scenario. Unbalanced income distribution i s responsible for Brazilian poverty, and within i t resides the main short-term solution. To reduce inequality in
an economic boom context seems more feasible than in recessive times, when losses are being shared

BRAZILIANPOLICYREGARDING
POVERTYREDUCTION
The improvement of Brazilian social policy and the broader access o f the poor to public goods
and services also alleviated the impact o f the crisis on the poorest. The government’s social protection
network alleviated the negative effect of the crisis on the poorest, especially in rural areas o f the Northeast
region. Certainly, during the last five years, there was a focus on implementing institutional changes in
federal social policy that resulted in the improvement o f social programs. From isolated and emergency
measures to more in-depth programs based on conditional income transfers, the government was able to
protect the poorest and avoid the rise o f poverty levels that could have resulted f r o m the economic crisis.

Among the isolated measures, the first was the implementation o f LOAS transfers (BPC) directed
towards the old and the disabled, after 1996. Second, during the unemployment crisis and the drought o f
1998, workfare programs were adopted that employed around one million individuals in the rural area o f
the Northeast43. Finally, starting in 1998, the federal government began to progressively index social security payments to the minimum wage, which rose faster than inflation, promoting real increases in the
transfers to beneficiaries.4. This type o f policy played a crucial role in improving the ratio between the
fiscal cost and the social benefit (measured in terms o f poverty reduction) o f Brazilian social policy. The
cost-benefit ratio o f giving a 10 percent increase only to those earning the constitutional floor o f one
minimum wage was favorable, and improved the efficiency of social policy. This i s because 56 percent o f
all retirees and pensioners receive exactly one minimum wage.
Regarding integrated poverty reduction policies, in 2000 the government integrated 15 separate
programs on education, health and income generation, among others, coordinating the actions o f ten different ministries and combining compensatory and structural programs to fight poverty adopting two criteria for eligibility: a regional criterion (based on the Municipal Human Development Index) and a
household income criterion (less than one-half the minimum wage). The use o f both o f these eligibility
conditions enhanced high-quality targeting. Better targeting and better-designed policies led to significant
progress in Brazilian social policy, and are responsible for the limited impact o f the economic downturn
on the poorest subgroups o f the population. In sum, the combination of the urban nature o f the economic
crisis and the social interventions of the government resulted in the preservation o f the incomes o f the
poorest, on average, and explains the change in the poverty profile.

As a consequence, income based poverty measures did not increase in the rural Northeast. However, this may be
credited to a switch from subsistence agriculture (not well captured in PNAD) to observed workfare transfers.

43

This measure mainly benefited rural retired workers and minimum wage recipients o f LOAS which are 67 years
old people or the disabled living in families with one quarter minimum wage o f per capita income.

IMPROVEMENT IN THE ACCESS
OF THE POOR TO PUBLIC SERVICES

The improvement in social policy i s also reflected in the evolution of the incidence o f social services, The rate o f access of the poor to education, sanitation, electricity, garbage collection and telephone
increased strongly in the last few years.
Improvement in the access o f the poor to education was impressive. The share o f children f r o m
the lower income quintiles that attend school or a day care center grew from 80.91 percent in 1995 to
93.07 percent in 2001. As a consequence, the gap between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles decreased
substantially, f r o m seventeen percentage points in 1996 to six percentage points in 2001.
Figure 2 shows that from 1995 to 2001, the proportion o f seven to fifteen year olds from poor
families (i.e. with per-capita incomes less than half the minimum wage ) that were in school increased
from 8 1.94 percent to 93.3 1 percent. This improvement could be in part be attributed to the cash transfer
programs to poor families related to children school attendance requirements.

For access to sewage, water treatment, electricity, garbage collection and telephone services, a
trend o f increasing coverage was observed that allowed a significant increase o f the access of the poor to
these public services in the past five years. However, there i s s t i l l a significant gap between the higher and
lower income deciles that reflects large differences that are s t i l l present between those with and without
access.
In sum, the trend o f increasing coverage promoted the increase in the rate o f access o f the poor to
the public services described above. For all the services analyzed, i t was possible to observe a strong improvement in the access o f the poor to these services, and a reduction o f the gap in the access o f the poorest and wealthiest income groups.

CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

The poverty rate fell after the economic stabilization of 1994 from 36 percent t o 29 percent, and
has hovered around 28-29 percent since then. But while the poverty rate has been stable, the poverty prof i l e has changed. Brazil’s poverty continues to be largely rural, and extreme poverty i s concentrated in
the largely semi-arid Northeast region o f the country.
However, since the macroeconomic crisis of the last few years negatively affected labor income
and unemployment in industrial sectors, and since the exchange rate devaluation reduced the income of
service sector workers, there has been a marked increase in poverty in the metropolitan areas, especially
in the Southeast region. Thus, i t must be recognized that the emphasis o f poverty reduction strategy has
shifted at the margin towards urban poverty.
Finally, the comparison o f the impacts o f growth and income redistribution on poverty highlighted the high potential impact o f income redistribution policies on poverty reduction.

ANNEX 5: Private Sector Strategy

-

I INTRODUCTION
The Brazil Private Sector Strategy (PSS) forms an integral part o f the W o r l d Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which i s guided by the vision for a more equitable, sustainable, and competitive Brazil. To this end, Brazil needs higher and more efficient investment for higher growth, led b y
the private sector. In order to stimulate private sector investment, improvements are needed in terms o f
access to financing, financing costs, logistics, infrastructure, the business environment, and human capital. Concurrently, corporate social responsibility, and other various means for the private sector t o contribute to Brazil's social progress w i l l be a fundamental aspect of this PSS. The PSS in the first part provides a diagnosis o f the principal impediments faced b y the private sector. The second part details the
WBG's strategy f o r addressing these impediments.

11- BACKGROUND
- BRAZILIN THE 1990s
A more resilient and more competitive private sector
The Brazilian private sector has gone through a series of external shocks, making i t s path towards
development look like a "roller coaster ride," reflected in the wide fluctuations o f the real exchange rate,
and sovereign risk spreads (see graphs below).

While Brazil has not enjoyed a smooth ride, i t has come a long way on both the economic and the
social fronts. The fact that Brazil has maintained a positive GDP growth (1.5 percent in 2002) in the face
o f high volatility in the financial markets and Real depreciation i s a testament o f the resilience of i t s
economy, and o f the private sector. Despite experiencing a considerable drop since 2002, FDI levels have
grown significantly since 1995 averaging US$25 billion per year for the last five years (more than three
times the annual average attained in the previous five years) making Brazil the second-highest recipient o f
FDI in the developing world. A t the same time, education and health levels have improved and more
people have access to basic services compared to a decade ago. Today Brazil has a more resilient economy, a more competitive private sector, and a better educated and healthier work force than 10 years ago.
However, the recent growth performance has been modest - much lower than the country's potential. GDP per capita growth in the 1990s averaged only 1.2 percent per year and unemployment remains at a level above 10 percent. Brazil has the potential to grow not only faster but in an equitable and
sustainable way. T o grow under the current global environment, Brazil w i l l need to focus in areas where
public and private sector actions help improve Brazil's competitiveness.

A growing private sector
Reforms in the 1990s had a significant impact on the development o f the private sector in Brazil.
Since the introduction o f the Plano Real, Brazil's private sector environment went through a series o f major changes, which included among others: the abolition o f state monopolies, the privatization o f state
enterprises, and the restructuring and privatization o f some state banks. The Brazilian privatization program has been a major undertaking by international standards. The share o f employees working for the
private sector has increased significantly, particularly in the case of utilities (see Figure 3). Between
1992-2001, private participation rose significantly in telecom, electricity, transport, water and sanitation,
with the sale o f government shares and concession rights generating US$58 billion in revenue. These sectors experienced substantial structural and regulatory reforms, emphasizing the role o f competition.

The private sector has been the main source o f investment accounting for 90 percent o f gross
fixed capital formation in the second half o f the 1990s, up from 85 percent during the first half. Public
investment as a share o f GDP has remained flat at about 2 percent for the past 6 years. Given the fiscal
constraints, the private sector w i l l need to play a greater role, if Brazil i s to grow faster than i t did in the
1990s.

Based on previous r e p o r t s / s ~ r v e y sand
~ ~CAS discussions, including joint IFC/Bank consultations
(see box 1) with the private sector in Brazil, members o f the Brazilian academia, and dialogue with government authorities, this private sector strategy focuses on developing a more competitive private sector
that would help the Brazilian economy attain higher growth rates with a better distribution of i t s benefits.

BOX 1 WORLD BANKAFC CONSULTATIONS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR The joint Bank IFC mission for
private sector consultations highlighted the following views from the private sector.
On the macroeconomic side, the private sector expressed satisfaction with the authorities’ ability to handle
niacroeconoInic issues. but i s concerned about the lack o f economic growth. They perceive inicroeconontic
issues as a key obstacle to growth, notably institutional truasitions. Key state institutions are s t i l l sending
some mixed signals to the, private sector due to the political transition, creating uncertainty for investment decisions.
A shortage of long-term financing - State banks (RNDES and others) and multilaterals (IFC, IDR) remain the
only sources o f long-term financing.
Interest rates are stiZl too high to support capital formation.
High Zogistics costs (ports, roads, rail), a key component o f “Custo Brazil” are particularly detrimental to exports.
Energy - The current regulatory framework creates uncertainty, discouraging the private investments necessary to meet future demand for energy, especially i n the event o f higher economic growth. There i s no longterm financing in the energy sector.
Bruzil’s investment c h u t e suffers from weaknesses in the administrative, regulatory, legal, and judicial
frameworks, an impediment to productive private sector activities, discouraging entrepreneurship and reduction o f informality.

A. Access to Long Term Financing and Financial Intermediation Costs46
According to various surveys, constrained access to long term credit and high interest rates are
the main growth impediment for large companies, SMEs, and microenterprises. Brazil has been experiencing a declining ratio o f credit to GDP (from 36 percent to 24 percent) and, a pronounced decrease of
bank to bank credit lines and long-term financing to the corporate sector in the past 2 years, as shown below.

While pointing out the key issues o f the Brazilian financial sector, the analysis does take into account the reform
progress realized in the past 3 years. Some o f the reforms have been passed recently, and their impact would be f e l t
in the near future, but more reforms are still needed. This section draws on the World Bank reports for the Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan - Reports No. P7448-BR, and 24067-BR.

Access to long term financing During the past two years, even large Brazilian corporates have
seen their access to long term financing come down significantly, especially since September 2002.
BNDES i s the only major credit institution which has maintained i t s level o f credit operations. While the
decrease since September 2002 was in part triggered by market concerns preceding the presidential elections, the levels o f long term credit to Brazilian corporates were already quite l o w before, and have not
recovered since. Corporations in Brazil are the main drivers for growth and employment. Their level of
activity has a strong impact on other smaller companies which are suppliers. If Brazilian corporates are
unable to access long term credit, they cannot finance their capital expenditure program, invest into increasing productivity, or restructure their debt (notably infrastructure companies). This in turn adversely
affects smaller companies in Brazil because o f their business linkages to the bigger companies.
The Brazilian private sector faces both a crowding out and an external financing shortage situations. Government borrowing continues to displace credit to the private sector. The financial sector i s
intermediating to government, rather than the productive sectors, resulting in low access to domestic long
term financing. With respect to international markets, despite recent improvements, access to long term
foreign financing remains constrained.

High level of interest rates and high intermediation costs. Brazil's burden o f i t s public debt
remains a major factor for a high level o f interest through both financial markets perceptions o f Brazil
risk and crowding out o f the private sector in the domestic market. This pressures interest rates upward
while diminishing the availability o f long-term lending. In addition to these macroeconomic considera-

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

117

tions, there are factors at the micro level, such as weak creditors rights and underdevelopment o f the domestic capital markets, that also affect the availability and intermediation costs o f financing.
Further development of capital markets is needed to increase access to long-term financing.
The role o f securities markets in mobilizing non-bank finance for private business i s very limited. This i s
essentially due to: (i)
the public sector i s the main borrower with more than 80 percent o f domestic debt
a significant part o f these securities in fact mobilizes
securities accounted for by government bonds; (ii)
)
bank finance (i.e. they are funded by bank deposits rather than capital market investors); and (iiiliquidity
in equity markets i s low for voting shares (most voting shares are not traded), discouraging investors and
equity issuers on account o f price volatility.

However, the potential for the development o f securities markets in Brazil appears substantial,
particularly considering the size and pace o f growth o f institutional investor funds. At present, most of
these institutional investor resources are held b y pension and mutual funds. Total assets o f institutional
investors are estimated at about US$120 billion or 22 percent o f GDP, the highest among Latin American
countries excepting Chile. With the upcoming pension reform, accelerated growth can be expected.
A number o f obstacles hinder the development o f securities markets. The overarching constraint,
as discussed above, i s the sizeable government refinancing needs. In addition, there are major deficiencies in corporate governance, with minority shareholders unduly exposed to risks o f expropriation by controlling shareholders, not least because o f poor proportional representation on boards, the non-adherence
to the one-share-one-vote principle, among others. Governance i s also weakened because there are few
voting shares and even fewer traded. Transaction costs in securities trading are high relative to developed
markets. Regulatory responsibilities are scattered across a number o f agencies, creating some overlaps in
function and differences in the quality o f supervision. Human resources o f CVM (Comisslio de Vulores
Mobiliurios do Brusil - Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission) are stretched and i t s enforcement
powers weak, weakening i t s capacity to investigate and enforce.
Default and overhead costs make credit scarce and expensive. Weak creditor rights, poor borrower screening, and insufficient creditor protection, all factor in to make credit scarce and expensive.
These are reflected in Brazil’s extraordinarily high interest rate spreads and in the high default and overhead costs embedded in these spreads. According to the Central Bank, the large spreads charged b y Brazilian banks in Brazil can be divided into administrative expenses (14 percent), taxes (29 percent), profits
(40 percent) and the cost o f default (17 percent). One particular problem in the development o f financial
markets i s the inability o f lenders to adequately enforce loan contracts because o f the inadequacy o f existing bankruptcy laws. Measures addressing these issues, some o f which are already under preparation or
have begun to be implemented, could contribute to reducing the cost o f intermediation.
Microfinance - Commercial microfinance penetration in Brazil remains low compared to
neighboring countries such as Peru and Bolivia, or smaller countries such as Nicaragua and El Salvador.
The market for microfinance in Brazil i s vast and i t s growth potential i s enormous. Microentrepreneurs
account for the vast majority o f all firms and contribute substantially to employment and GDP. Regulatory factors, taxation, the substantial presence o f public banks’ lending, and difficulties in expanding client outreach largely explain the l o w rate o f commercial microfinance penetration. The sector could also
benefit from technological innovations as well as improvements in the collection and maintenance o f information, but a more systemic approach at the regulatory level could unleash the potential of selfsustainable microfinance operations.

B. Logistics costs4’
High logistics costs put Brazil on a disadvantageous position vis-&-vis competitors, if Brazil wants to
compete internationally. A recent World Bank study estimates logistics costs in Brazil to be about 20
percknt o f GDP, similar to
Figure 7: Logistics costs as a share of GDP
neighboring countries but
almost twice the level in
OECD countries (see Figure 7). These high costs
are clearly a concern to
exporters as they erode
their competitive edge
against competitors in
other countries.
Trade and logistics Despite i t s very recent
growth, trade represents a
small share o f GDP compared to some other
emerging market economies (see table below). In
2000, Brazil’s trade volume was at 23 percent o f
GDP compared to 62 percent for Chile, and 64
percent for Mexico.

In a recent study, Brazilian exporters identified major constraints to export. Customs and ports
lead the l i s t s with more than 35 percent o f respondents identifying them as a leading constraint (see Figure 8). In the same study, access to export and production financing were also identified among the top
seven constraints to exports. There i s an ample l i s t o f impeding logistics costs. The main constraints can

be regrouped into the following three categories: (a) inventory and warehousing costs; (b) transport and
transshipment costs; and, (c) administrative costs.

=

Inventory and warehousing costs have remained particularly high in Brazil. The cost to the
Brazilian economy of the additional inventory holdings i s significant, exceeding 4 percent o f GDP. The
l o w quality o f infrastructure services, particularly transport, i s the main cause o f the high inventory costs.

Transport and transshipment costs have been estimated at about 2 percent o f GDP. Brazil’s
domestic freight transport market has been dominated by the trucking industry, which has a weak regulatory environment. There are many informal businesses offering low-quality services, a high incidence o f
cargo theft, and evidence o f overcapacity, with a large share o f empty return trips. The poor condition of
road networks (resulting from low levels o f investment in the past 20 years) further reduces the efficiency
and reliability of trucking services, increasing operating costs by 10-30 percent and affecting delivery
schedules.
Administrative logistics (customs, losses and insurance) - For Brazilian firms involved in foreign trade, customs represent a major cost for exports, more than 10 percent o f operating costs on average. Outdated customs procedures and practices add another burden for Brazil’s exports. A modest reduction in logistics costs of, say, 15 percent could reduce firms’ costs by about 5 percent on average,
which could have a substantial impact on Brazil’s economic growth. Finally, improvements in the logistics systems and rural infrastructure services in the country’s more remote and less developed regions,
particularly the North and the Northeast, could substantially increase investment and growth opportunities
in these regions.

C. Infrastructure Bottlenecks
L o w Investment Levels. Despite the reform efforts o f the 199Os, the investment expansion in
1994-2002 in most o f infrastructure (excluding telecommunications) was the lowest in the last seventy
years (see Table 2). Investments in infrastructure have reduced their pace during the last two decades especially in the electricity and road sectors. Generation capacity expanded at an average o f 4.1 percent per

12n

A M o r e Eauitable. Sustainable. and ComDetitive Brazil - Countrv Assistance Strategv FY2003-2007

year in 1981-93, against 9.8 percent per year between 1951-80. Investment in highways fell to less than
0.5 percent o f GDP in 1980-96 from 1.6 percent during 1967-76, and has decreased abruptly over the last
three years. Finally, in water and sanitation, there was a significant contraction in investment: from about
0.3-0.4 percent in the late 1980’s to 0.2 percent of GDP in 1995.48 In all sectors demand for infrastructure
services was rapidly increasing, calling for higher investment levels. The exception could be telecom,
which has shown significant coverage increase since i t s privatization program. The slow increase in infrastructure investment, in spite o f the large privatization program, appears to be the product o f fiscal constraints and in particular s t i l l evolving regulatory framework, as the following example o f the power sector indicates.

T h e Electricity Sector

- T h e Urgency of T h e Situation

The power outage o f 2001 indicated that the benefits of regulatory reform and privatization have
not been as substantial as in the telecom sector. The energy crisis pointed to serious weaknesses in the
sector, which if not addressed rapidly could in the medium term evolve into a major constraint to economic growth and productivity. In light o f the current situation some private sector companies have even
started to invest in their own generation facilities, thereby increasing their cost o f doing business.
Issues in the power sector are the direct consequences of an uncompleted reform program, magnified by the Real devaluation, the lack o f access to long term credit, and the increase in sovereign risks.
Brazil has yet to have a general power sector reform law with a clearly stated tariff-setting system. This
sector has suffered from the vagueness in tariff-setting provisions and other regulatory weaknesses, foreign exchange risk due to the “dollar costheal-revenue” mismatch, uncertainty in the legal framework due
to the lack o f a single national electricity law, and weak contract enf~rcement.~’

As a result, the electricity sector i s hampered by the dire financial situation o f both generation and
they have been severely affected by the devaluation (most o f their debt condistribution companies: (i)
entracted at the time o f acquisition i s in foreign currency while their revenues are in local currency), (ii)

Currently, there i s no immediate threat o f electricity shortage, given the l o w growth, and following the energy rationing, a more efficient use o f electricity. However, if the economy i s to grow faster,
the power sector would be unable to meet an increase in consumption as investment for increased capaci t y takes a few years to be realized. Under the present situation, generation companies have little incenPolicy Note o n the Water Agenda, W o r l d Bank, 2002.

tive to increase their capacity, given the low demand and the critical financial situation of the distribution
companies.
According to a recent survey5', Brazil's power sector needs US$82.3 billion in investments b y
2020 in order to support economic growth. Based on an annual average 3 percent growth rate, the country would need US$68 billion to add another 85,000 M W o f installed generation capacity, as well as
US$12 billion to build 35,000 km of transmission lines and US$2.3 billion in distribution. Yet l i t t l e investment has been forthcoming in the past few years.

D. Business Environment and the Regulatory Framework
The CAS private sector consultations have highlighted the regulatory burden as an obstacle to
growth. Compared to other Latin American countries, the business environment in Brazil i s s t i l l burdened
b y excessive regulation. Furthermore, a weak judicial system adds to the cost of doing business in Brazil.

Barriers to entry A constraint to investment, competition and productivity Brazilian businesses often cite the process o f business registration as a significant barrier. Establishing a new business
takes on average 82 days in Brazil, three times longer than in Chile51. The registration process for a partnership (Zimitudu) or corporation (sociedude unonimu) involves six different administrations: a company
must obtain licenses and permits from both federal and state environmental, health, and labor authorities.
It must register for taxes at three levels o f government, presenting abundant documentation at every step.
For foreign firms beginning operations in Brazil, there are added complications: a fully foreign owned
Brazilian subsidiary i s illegal, but the company can be registered as a Brazilian corporation with one Brazil-resident director. The registration process takes about 60 days in Brazil, compared with less than 2 in
Chile, Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, and Singapore. High regulatory barriers to entry have also adverse
impact on the development o f the SMEs and microenterprises who cannot access credit because of their
informal status.

Innovations limited by regulations, and access to financing52- Innovative performance in
2000 was lower than that of India and Singapore, countries with much fewer patents granted than Brazil
15 years ago. During the ~ O ’ S ,the Brazilian performance in terms o f licensing (US$8 per capita) was
lower than Argentina, India, Korea, Spain and the United States. In Brazil, existing legal rules create important obstacles against cooperation between public universities and the private sector. In addition, a
recent survey indicates that the limitation o f own funds was the main obstacle for investments in R&D for
67 percent o f the f i r m s . Taken together with the limited access for the Brazilian corporates to long term
financing for modernizinghpgrading their production process, Brazil faces the risk o f falling behind i t s
competitors. I t i s estimated that only 26 percent o f the Brazilian innovative f i r m s would engage in cooperation with third parties o f which only 24 percent would work with universities. Only 11 percent o f the
researchers are working at private firms, contrary to 55 percent in Korea and 79 percent in the US.
Weaknesses and inefficiencies in the judicial systems3- Weaknesses and inefficiencies in the
judicial system add to Custo Brazil. The widespread negative perceptions o f i t s functioning impedes both
foreign investment and financial intermediation. Incomparison with many other countries, the perception
o f governance in Brazil ranks lower. Figure 10 presents some comparisons, based upon business and citizen perceptions in various countries. In the three selected governance criteria categories (contract enforceability, policy and regulatory continuity, and bureaucracy, i.e., public service provision by government agencies), Brazil consistently ranks among the lowest, along with Argentina and Mexico. Disputes
involving property rights, contract enforcement, including debt collection are some o f the recurring problems in Brazil’s business environment. Court cases can drag on for years, with attendant costs and uncertainty in the final disposition. Multiple appeals are a standard practice. Another particular problem affects the development o f financial markets: the inability o f lenders to adequately enforce loan contracts
because o f the inadequacy o f existing bankruptcy laws. This i s expected to change with the new bankruptcy law.

Labor Productivity

Despite the progress made in the last 20 years, much remains to be done for the country to develop a human capital able to sustain economic growth. Improvements in human capital are key to increase the productivity o f the private sector. To generate higher and sustainable economic growth requires a sustained accumulation o f human capital over time. As the fiscal constraints restrict the country’s public investment program, the private sector has a role to play in providing additional resources to
meet the education and health sector needs o f the country, in coordination with the public sector.

-

Education While Brazil i s considered as an example o f good practice in terms o f education reform, Brazilian education levels s t i l l lag behind the region’s levels, and many other countries. Today a
young Brazilian enters the labor market with an average 6 years o f schooling, compared to more than 11
years in OECD countries, and 8 years in East Asian countries.
Investment efforts need to be maintained to improve access to and the quality o f junior secondary
education as well as university education. Higher education in Brazil s t i l l reaches only a small portion of
the population. About 15 percent o f the relevant age cohort i s enrolled in higher education, compared with
36 percent in Argentina, 32 percent in Chile, 30 percent in Uruguay, and 52 percent in the OECD countries. Moreover, students from the highest income quintile secure two-thirds o f the places in the country’s
free, elite public institutions, which tend to be o f higher quality than private institutions. Firms cite the
education o f the workforce as an obstacle to investments. L o w worker productivity and inequality both
follow from Brazil’s education system, which remains behind other countries despite rapid advances.

The private sector has increased i t s participation in education, particularly at the secondary and
tertiary levels. In Sao Paul0 state, the private education sector serves approximately 15 percent o f all students - with nearly 20 percent at the high school level. Many private schools operate more than one unit,
frequently vertically integrating into other levels o f schooling. Private distance education companies and
private tutoring are also developing. Nationwide, the private sector accounts for 65 percent o f total enrollment in tertiary education institutions, with a response to the recent growth in demand for higher education and the inability o f the public sector to accommodate this demand.

-

Health Despite i t s improvements, Brazil’s health status lags far behind that of other Latin
American countries with similar incomes. Moreover, disparities in health care funding and utilization
among regions and social groups remain large. Many o f the poor lack regular access to basic services
while higher-income groups enjoy access to costly, complex care that i s publicly funded.
Within that context the private sector has been increasing i t s role. The private health sector in
Brazil i s now accounting for two-thirds o f inpatient facilities (many o f which contract with the national
health system, Sistema Univeral de Saude - SUS) and 16 percent o f outpatient facilities. In addition, about
28 percent o f Brazilians are covered b y private medical insurance or group health plans. These private
plans became regulated in 1998, following the passage o f a federal law and the creation of a federal regulatory agency (Agencia Nacional de Saude Suplementar). The positive outcome o f this legislation has
been to establish accounting standards and reserve requirements, limit exclusion provisions, and improve
efficiency to some extent. However, i t has also introduced l i m i t s on premiums, which most private health
plans consider unrealistic and may be limiting the growth o f the sector. As a result o f pressure from various groups, this legislation remains under revision. Foreign investment in the health sector has also been
limited b y the prevailing regulatory system, in that foreign investors cannot hold equity in entities that
provide direct patient care.

I V THEWORLDBANKGROUPPRIVATE
SECTOR STRATEGY
The WBG’s Private Sector Strategy’s main objective i s to increase Brazil’s competitiveness to attain higher, sustainable and equitable economic growth. The private sector strategy focus w i l l be on: (i)
supporting companies which strengthen Brazil’s competitiveness and generate growth and employment,
(ii)
fostering financial sector development by broadeningfacilitating access to all levels o f the business
society (corporate, SMEs, microenterprises), (iii)
supporting microeconomic policy reform and removing
infrastructure bottlenecks (especially in power, transport and logistics), (iv) improving the business environment and the regulatory framework, (iv) improving labor productivity through improved access to
health and education.

The WBG additionality - IBRD, IFC, MIGA
In pursuing the WBG private sector strategy, IBRD, IFC and MIGA w i l l work closely and contribute according to their respective comparative advantages.

IBRD - In general IBRD’s comparative advantage lies in i t s ability to assist governments in macroeconomic policy, knowledge building and transfer, sector-wide policy advice and capacity building.
The Bank has also been effective in keeping an on-going policy dialogue with the Brazilian authorities
through open and constructive discussions.
IFC - IFC’ s advantages lie primarily in specific transactions, catalyzing financing where IFC’ s
presence adds value. IFC’s strength i s derived from i t s practical knowledge o f the financial and corporate
sectors, i t s dialogue with international and local private investors, hands-on experience in local constraints to private investment, and accumulated knowledge and expertise.
In Brazil, as in other middle-income countries, demand for IFC services fluctuates with the extent
o f i t s comparative advantages vis-&vis other sources o f financing and know-how available for the private
sector. As noted earlier, access to long term financing i s difficult in Brazil. Under the current market
conditions, this applies to most Brazilian companies, including fairly large companies with good credit.
Together with IDB and BNDES, the IFC i s the only significant medium and long term lender in Brazil.
IFC’ s credit lines have proven to have an important catalytic effect on international financial markets,
which follow the Corporation’s intervention in emerging markets, as demonstrated b y the recent trade
finance facilities in Brazil.

According to the OEG report and consultations with the private sector, IFC’ s clients believe that
i t s additionality has been greater than the investment amount would indicate, ranging from sharing technical and financial structuring expertise to encouraging environmental and social good practices. IFC’ s
additionality has been also strong through B-loan mobilization and advisory assistance. IFC’ s actions and
presence during several crises demonstrated the additionality o f IFC product and expertise, in a middle
income country such as Brazil. Recently, IFC has been increasingly building a unique capability to add
value through noninvestment assistance such as i t s dissemination o f best practice in terms o f environmental and social practices, corporate governance, privatization advice notably in infrastructure, and support for corporate social responsibility.

MIGA - MIGA’s comparative advantage i s i t s ability to catalyze private sector capacity with i t s
own capacity so as to facilitate additional foreign investment and lending into Brazil. During the past
three years, most private insurers have only been active in Brazil in projects where MIGA was also a
guarantor.

IBRD, IFC, MIGA collaboration
In Brazil, the collaboration between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA has made important progress. The
three institutions have worked together increasing their coordination over time. IBRD’s assistance in enhancing the regulatory and supervisory environment and the strengthening o f the banking sector and financial sector infrastructure are helping set the stage for IFC’s increased involvement in direct and indirect assistance to viable Brazilian financial intermediaries, while MIGA’s guarantee program facilitates
the participation o f foreign banks. In infrastructure, a number o f sub sectors where IBRD’s assistance has
helped improve the regulatory framework have provided opportunities for IFC’s and MIGA’ s sequential
involvement in helping structure and mobilize financing for pioneering infrastructure projects.
IFC’ s practical experience with impediments to private sector development in general and SMEs
in particular complements World Bank’s work on research and policy issues for Bank support to SMEs.
Together with FIAS they have worked to improve Brazil’s business environment and regulatory framework through investment climate surveys or advisory services. IBRD’s assistance in reforms in the social
sector continues to be supplemented b y the IFC’s support for private services providers, helping enhance
public-private complementarities.
The following section outlines the focus o f each WBG institution.

IBRD Strategic Focus
IBRD w i l l focus on using i t s instruments to strengthen the investment climate. Policy-based lending w i l l target the regulatory environment for infrastructure, competition regulation, financial sector depth
and efficiency, private-sector innovation, and exports. All policy-based lending i s supported b y complementary technical assistance loans to build institutional capacity in the regulatory agencies, key ministries, and the Central Bank. Technical assistance w i l l also continue in the energy sector. In selected instances with high demonstration-effect value (e.g., concession design in roads, multimodal transport planning), the Bank w i l l continue to make strategic investment loans into infrastructure sectors in accordance
with the government’s priorities as manifested in the PPA. Finally, AAA w i l l focus on using the newly
completed Investment Climate Survey to construct diagnostics and policy options, in addition to studies
o f local economic development, infrastructure regulation, the dynamic effects o f trade, financial sector
competition, and other areas.
I F C Strategic Focus
In tandem with the Bank’s assistance, IFC w i l l continue to play a strong role under the competitiveness theme, and more generally in support o f private sector development that cuts across the three key
dimensions o f this CAS. IFC’s continued support to the Brazilian private sector w i l l accompany the
Bank’s assistance, particularly in (i)
enhancing the prospects for competitiveness and growth, and (ii)
improving social equity through voluntary actions b y the private sector. IFC w i l l continue to focus on the
choice o f instruments for investment activities, with the objective o f optimizing riskheturn profiles.
The first objective would entail supporting: growth generating firms with a wide network o f
stakeholders, export enhancing activities including infrastructure and logistics, and activities improving
access to long-term financing. Tighter market conditions could continue to require IFC to respond to
counter-cyclical needs o f the private sector under this objective. Depending on market conditions, IFC
might be required to rapidly adjust i t s short-term priorities within the CAS framework, as was the case o f
the rapid deployment o f trade finance facilities during the last CAS period. Given i t s exposure constraints, IFC’s involvement in this type o f support w i l l be done selectively, with priority given according
to financial market conditions, potential development impact and risk-return o f I F C investments. IFC

126

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

w i l l also pursue i t s catalytic objective, raising financing through i t s B loan program and other means.
Given their potential impact on competitiveness, export-oriented sectors (including mining, hydrocarbons, agribusiness, and manufacturing) and infrastructure (including, transport and logistics - portdrail,
and power) w i l l receive attention. The financial sector, given the importance o f financial intermediation
for the growth and productivity agenda, w i l l continue to be an area o f focus for IFC.
Under the second objective, IFC w i l l support the growing momentum towards socially responsible activities within the Brazilian private sector. This w i l l involve: support for firms committed to environmental and social sustainability, improving corporate governance practice, microfinance, sociallyoriented entrepreneurship, and assistance to the Fome Zero program.

A - Catalyze Investment Flows which Strengthen Brazil’s Competitiveness and Generate Growth
and Employment
The Brazilian private sector has faced a series of difficult external and domestic events that have
hindered i t s normal course o f business, let alone new long-term activities; but has shown a remarkable
resilience to overcome these difficulties. However, this makeshift approach, although inevitable at the
time, i s neither sustainable in the long run nor conducive to competitive gains, if i t i s not accompanied by
investments for the future.
Long term financing to support investments going forward has been in critical shortage for the
past few years. Despite the recent improvements in the market, a large number o f Brazilian corporates are
faced with the difficulty in raising long-term debt without official support. Within this context, IFC w i l l
continue to help finance firms that are important for Brazil’s growth, employment, and competitiveness.
These firms tend to have a wide network of SME vendors/suppliers associated with their operations, a
large employment force, and a significant fiscal contribution. Economic and social impact on a wider base
would result from the demonstration effect o f IFC’s support for environmentally and socially responsible
business practices by these firms, and through their business linkages to smaller economic activities. A
critical element for the growth o f small companies i s the stability and growth o f larger companies that
invariably maintain a large network o f suppliers/vendors linked to their day-to-day operations. A competitive Brazil w i l l have to be built upon competitive value-chains cutting through linkages among large
and small private sector actors. For this to be realized, and for dynamic innovative activities to materialize through value-chains, improved access to long-term investment financing for both small and large
firms plays a critical role.
The focus under this category of IFC activity w i l l be on good sponsors, with strong managerial
capabilities, whose projects will, with their success, provide a strong demonstration effect for potential
investors. One facet o f this approach i s the financial restructuring and modernization o f corporate group
structures, another i s the financing of their rationalization and expansion plans - both through direct financing by IFC and through its mobilization o f commercial finance. Another facet i s the strengthening o f
their corporate governance practices, to eventually enable them to access long term financing on their
own. IFC w i l l also seek to support export companies, some investing into other emerging market economies such as Marcopolo (see box 2), and companies in agribusiness and manufacturing, as well as other
exporting sectors.

B - Foster Financial Sector Development, Broaden Access to Financing
Limited access for the private sector to investment capital, and l o w domestic financial intermediation, i s a core issue in Brazil’s private sector development. IFC’s approach under this theme i s twofold:

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

127

(i)
reach out to enterprises that l a c k access to term-financing through l o c a l intermediaries, and (ii)
support
transactions that help develop the domestic financial sector, including l o c a l capital markets.

-

Box 2. Supporting both Brazilian exports and Brazilian investments into other emerging markets M a r copolo SA., the leading Latin American bus producer, founded in 1949 in Caxias do Sul, Brazil, operates four
plants in Brazil and five additional facilities in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Portugal, and South Africa. Marcopolo has a total labor force o f 8,100 employees and supplies buses to over 70 countries worldwide. The company produces buses ranging from minibuses to double decker coaches, and manufacture parts (seats, lining,
windows, side panels and other high-tech plastic products).

IFC’s FY03 investment consisted in a US$30 million loan to the Brazilian company, and a US$10 million loan
to i t s Mexican subsidiary to support the international expansion o f Marcopolo.
Corporate Governance: Marcopolo i s listed at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa), registered as a level 2
company, which applies to those companies that voluntarily decide to adopt corporate governance standards
above those required by the Brazilian legislation.
Social promam: Marcopolo contributes to the local community through an educational support program - the
Marcopolo School for Professional Training, to develop skilled labor among the local community.
Environment: The company has a proactive and innovative waste management program for solid residues, and
i s implementing a zero effluent discharge program. IFC leveraged i t s ability to mobilize scarce long-term financing by convincing the company to implement a corporate wide environmental management system to share
best practices among all i t s industrial plants.

-

Access to financing IFC will continue to l o o k at possibilities to support financing through intermediaries in the f o r m of credit lines and risk sharing facilities. Credit facilities are expected to address
the financing needs o f the corporate sector, i n c l u d i n g m i d d l e market firms and SMEs. This w o u l d take
the f o r m o f credit lines with commercial banks, or the f o r m o f IFC providing credit enhancement to financial instruments/facilities that help raise l o c a l currency debt. In this category, IFC w o u l d also consider the possibilities o f providing currency/interest rate swaps as a means to h e l p enhance such transactions.
Commercially oriented microfinance institutions are starting t o grow in Brazil, and are destined to
b e important financial intermediaries f o r the private sector development o f Brazil. T h e y are particularly
important in terms of employment generation, o f reaching urban or rural poor, and o f their substantial
developmental impact for a relatively small amount of investment. As demonstrated with M i c r o i n v e s t
(see box 3), IFC will continue t o support microenterprises through this investment and possible n e w ones
in the microfinance sector. T h e scaling up o f the impact o f the microfinance sector w i l l depend o n progress in addressing regulatory constraints.
Box 3. Supporting the development of microfinance in Brazil - Microinvest i s a regulated microfinance institution that succeeded RioCred, a microfinance NGO founded in 1998 as a joint-venture between Banco Fininvest and the Municipality o f Rio de Janeiro. Fininvest, the project’s main sponsor, i s one o f the largest finance
companies in the low-income consumer and retail credit segment in Brazil with more than 12 million accounts
and offices in 50 cities.

IFC’s investment consists in a US$1.25 million equity investment committed in FY03 to help develop Microinvest into a leading microfinance institution in Brazil reaching out to microentrepreneurs which have very little
access to financial services. More specifically, the project’s objectives are to: (i)
reach out to up to 100,000 microenterprises in Brazil’s low income segments, and (ii)
assist in institution building for one o f the very few
commercially oriented, self sustainable microfinance institutions in the country. Success o f the project would
translate into an important demonstration effect by proving that microfinance can operate as a sustainable business in Brazil while helping pave the way for a much needed development o f this sector.

128

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Financial sector development - In this area IFC w i l l focus i t s investment activities in areas that
can - directly and indirectly - play an important role in mobilizing additional private sector financing, for
both financial sector entities and ultimately their real economy clients as well. Foremost among these i s
assisting financial markets entities in obtaining long-term financing - both in the domestic and international banks as well as capital markets. For the various reasons analyzed previously, access o f these entities (and most o f their clients) to such markets i s limited. As far as domestic, local currency-denominated
markets are concerned, real borrowing costs remain extremely high and tenors relatively short, largely
because o f crowding out by the public sector and several other structural impediments to lower domestic
interest rates. In terms o f international bank and capital market borrowings, there i s limited credit available beyond maturities o f 2 years - aside from opportunistic issuance o f foreign exchange-remittance securitization transactions. Therefore, IFC w i l l concentrate its efforts in (i)
making available partial credit
enhancementdguarantees on transactions that assist Brazilian financial entities in raising funding longtenor funding from commercial sources for on-lending to their clients in the real sector, and (ii)
A/B Loan
transactions that help to address temporary liquidity shortfalls involving various financial sector assets
classes (e.g., short- or medium-term trade finance).

IFC w i l l also target several other areas for its financial markets activities. In particular, several
technical assistance and investment efforts are currently aimed at helping to reduce the high level o f interest rates and intermediation costs, and thereby promoting further domestic capital markets development.
These efforts are meant to promote better provision o f and access to credit scoring information, in order to
help address one o f the structural causes o f high real interest rates in the country (information asymmetries), and also to promote more lending to SME’s. In addition, support for the development o f local capital markets i s expected to be provided through institution building o f local financial infrastructure (see
box 4), such as brokerage firms, rating and valuation agencies, credit information agencies, and so forth.

-

Box 4. Novo Mercado The Novo Mercado i s a set o f listing segments on Bovespa (SBo Paulo Stock Exchange) which permits companies to communicate the quality o f their corporate governance to the market b y
voluntarily adhering to higher standards than required by law in the areas o f accounting, treatment o f minority
shareholders, and agreement to arbitration o f disputes. As a formal sponsor, I F C worked closely with Bovespa in the launching o f the Novo Mercado. Together with members o f the Investor Responsibility Task Force,
IFC actively participated in drafting the proposed rules for the Novo Mercado in OctoberDJovember, 2000. In
M a y 2001, together with TIAA-CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement
Equities Fund, a U S financial services organization), IFC helped organize the New York “Roadshow”, during
which representatives o f Bovespa presented the Novo Mercado concept and answered questions from members o f the Investor Responsibility Task Force and other Wall Street players. In June 2001, I F C participated in
the launch o f Novo Mercado. To date, I F C continues to provide regular feedback to Bovespa on the perception o f the Novo Mercado by both investors and potential participating companies.
IFC’s involvement in the public dialogue on corporate governance in Brazil has strengthened i t s ability to assist and influence its investee companies to improve their practices. In late 2001, I F C sent each o f i t s listed
company clients in Brazil a letter inquiring about their intentions to l i s t on the Novo Mercado. I F C worked
actively with a number o f large listed investees to develop corporate governance improvement programs,
which resulted in a number o f such companies qualifying for the Novo Mercado listings.

C - Support Micro-Economic Policy Reform to Remove Infrastructure Bottlenecks
Private investment in infrastructure has been constrained since the mid 199Os, reflecting mainly a
slowing down in the progress o f reforms, and in part the general withdrawal o f strategic investors from
infrastructure in developing countries in recent years. There i s a large need for private sector participation in all these sectors, and adequate reform could present a large demand for IFC services. IFC’s activ-

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

129

i t y under this theme w i l l depend on the pace o f reform in power, transportation and logistics, and water
and sanitation.
Since the latter part o f the 199Os, IFC has supported the infrastructure sector. I F C investments
covered a wide range of subsectors including power generation, ports, telecommunication and roads, and
also provided advisory services. Both IBRD and IFC have been working together on advising the Brazilian authorities on infrastructure reform. As reforms move forward, IFC w i l l focus on catalyzing/facilitating private sector investment, and MIGA’s guarantee w i l l help bring in foreign investment.

B o x 5: IFC Advisory Services Petrolina Water & Sanitation Privatization IFC successfully completed
the first phase o f the advisory work for the early termination o f the Petrolina Water Concession contract, mediating negotiations among the State o f Pernambuco, a State utility company, and the Municipality o f Petroh a , while developing the technical auditing and financial evaluation o f the Petrolina water and sewerage system. The project has since entered the second phase for the privatization o f the water and sewage system operator. IFC’s support was provided for the: (i)
selection of, and the meetings with, pre-qualified operators, (ii)
preparation o f the two laws approved in M a y 2002 (the Water and Sanitation Regulatory Law and the Regulatory Agency Law), (iii)
finalization o f technical and financial evaluation for the bid, and (iv) negotiation with
the financiers. The bidding was launched in early September 2003. The sale o f the concession has so far not
proceeded due to market concerns about the price being too high. IFC continues to seek a solution that w i l l
work for both the municipality and potential investors.
Pernambuco Multi Sector - Retained by the State o f Pernambuco, IFC conducted an analysis o f regulatory,
legal, financial, and economic issues related to the privatization of: (i)
Metrorec, the surface rail metro o f Recife; (ii)Copergs, the concessionaire for natural gas distribution (partly owned by the State, together with
BR 232 road connecting Recife to major inland cities. The mandate was comPetrobras and Enron); and (iii)
pleted with the presentations to the Government o f Pernambuco. IFC i s in discussions with the State o f Pernambuco on potential future advisory assignments for related projects.

Power - As noted previously, the power sector’s investment and financing needs are large, and
the sector i s likely to benefit substantially from private participation. IFC w i l l continue to support the
financing o f private power projects, as Bank-assisted sector reform progresses. The Government i s in the
process o f developing a new model to guide the long-term development o f the sector in order to address
the sector’s current challenges. IFC expects to be an active financier o f private power companies in Braz i l going forward in order to ensure that the sector i s able to support the growth and development o f the
Brazilian economy.
Box 6: IFC’s Response t o Brazil’s 2001 Electricity Crisis - IFC actively responded to the 2001 Brazilian
electricity crisis by focusing considerable resources on helping to meet the financing needs o f the power sector.
I F C supported three large power investments in 2002-2003: the Macae Thermal Power Plant, CPLF Energia and
the TermoFortaleza Power Plant.
Macae i s a 922 megawatt gas-fired power plant located in the State of Rio de Janeiro developed under the Government’s Priority Thermal Power Program. IFC’s support included a US$65 million A loan, a US$10 million
C loan, and a US$50 million B loan (currently being arranged).
C P F L - CPFL i s the largest power company in Brazil owned b y Brazilian private investors. The company owns
interests in five hydropower plants with a total capacity o f approximately 4,000 megawatts and three distribution
companies serving a total o f 5 million customers. IFC committed a loan o f US$40 million which i s convertible
into equity upon the initial public offering o f the company’s shares. IFC was also actively involved in mobilizing funding for this project from BNDES (which has disbursed US$94 million equivalent) and US OPIC (which

Transport and Logistics - IFC’s support w i l l continue in this subsector, which plays a critical
role in enhancing Brazil’s competitiveness by providing more efficient services with higher quality. In
the past, IFC has invested in transport and logistics (see box below). I t w i l l continue to look for opportunities to support further improvements in transport, in particular, logistics, port facilities, intermodal facilities, and other modes o f private transportation.

Box 7: Improving Container and General Cargo Terminal in The Port of Salvador In FY01-03, IFC
committed US$10 million in equity investment in Tecon Salvador (TS), a special purpose Brazilian company
that won the 25-year lease to own and operate the container and general cargo terminal in the Port o f Salvador,
State o f Bahia. The investment financed the upgrading and operation of the terminal. The project helped increase the terminal’s capacity from 55,000 containers to 110,000 containers within 2 years. Today the company i s doing well operationally and was able to weather the Real’s devaluation b y increasing volumes while
lowering costs. I t has established itself as the leading port operator at the Port o f Salvador handling approximately 85% o f all containers and 40% o f all general cargo. In 2002, i t handled 74,865 containers, reaching the
2004 volume target two years ahead o f time. Volume i s expected to continue growing in 2003.

Bahia i s one o f Brazil’s poorer states with GDP per capita about half the national average and, over the years,
has been the target o f several economic incentives, few o f which have resulted in sustainable growth. B y providing cost-effective and efficient access to coastal and ocean shipping services to an increasing number of
products, this project has helped attract investment and support sustainable economic development throughout
Bahia. Efficient operations are having a wide-ranging positive developmental impact not only in the metropolitan area o f Salvador but also on nearby industrial zones and on agriculture-based export communities in
the state.

D Human Capital Development - Health and Education- Broaden Access
IFC w i l l continue i t s efforts to expand i t s health and education investments in Brazil, although i t
w i l l proceed cautiously in the near term, depending on reform progress in both sectors. Both the private
health and education sectors have suffered from the impact o f the country’s recent economic turmoil; the
crisis in the private health sector has also been compounded by recent regulatory changes that have put
pressure on the private sector.
Given these circumstances, IFC w i l l be highly selective in seeking investments in the social sectors. Current portfolio projects include Laboratorio Fleury (a leading provider o f medical diagnostic services in Sao Paulo), Itaberaba, a holding company that invests in private healthcare service companies,
Salutia, an IT services company working in the health sector, and Escola24Horas.com, an educational
portal delivering on-line tutoring services.
In the short-to-medium term, IFC w i l l focus on first-tier hospitals, ambulatory care facilities, and
diagnostic centers. IFC w i l l also strengthen i t s coordination with the World Bank in exploring investment
opportunities related to public-private partnerships in the health sector. In the longer term, IFC may look
at second-tier hospitals and hospital management companies, as well as companies providing non-clinical
support services to providers and back-office services to the insurance industry.

Likewise, in the education sector, IFC w i l l focus on top-tier universities in the short term. In the
longer term i t may explore second- and third-tier institutions, which, although currently growing rapidly
in number, do not always meet IFC’s financial and governance standards. In addition, IFC w i l l continue
to study and explore possible investments in the student loan market.

E Equity and Sustainability Support to Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives
IFC’s intervention in the corporate sector w i l l also entail support for the growing activity in advancing corporate social responsibility. The Brazilian corporate sector has increasingly focused on this
agenda, recognizing the fact that a competitive Brazil w i l l not be achieved or maintained without better
social equity and greater attention to sustainability issues. ,IFC w i l l support such efforts through both i t s
direct financing and non-investment/technical assistance.
IFC w i l l continue i t s efforts in non-investment activities by focusing on private sector initiatives with
high social and environmental impact. Recent activities have included support for sustainable forestry
management and community development, carbon emission reduction, the Fome Zero program as well as
AIDS prevention, as described here below:

-

Fome Zero IFC provided a US$300,000 grant in March 2003 for an N G O - the Ethos Institute, and
a think tank - the Polis Institute, to help create innovative links between businesses and local communities. The Brazilian partners have started to: (i)
set up a database to record the needs o f more than
900 participating municipalities from Brazil’s poorer regions (mostly in the Northeast) and the contriestablish a call center and a web-site to create
butions being offered by corporate participants, and (ii)
links between companies and the local communities.
POEMA (Pobreza E Meio-ambiente na AmazGnia or Poverty and Environment in the Amazon, a local NGO) for the Bolsa AmazGnia Program - Bolsa Amazonia i s a program o f POEMA, affiliated
with the University o f Para. I t promotes sustainable business for the Amazon basin populations. The
Capacity Building Facility (WB-IFC Small and Medium Enterprise Department) has extended a
US$240,000 grant to POEMA to assist small agro-extractive producers in the Amazon basin in
strengthening their business, managerial and technical skills, developing bankable business plans, and
converting from subsistence production to more environmentally sustainable entrepreneurial enterprises.
Together with Daimler Chrysler, POEMA established a 50-employee affiliated company - POEMATEC. Each month 3,000 poor farmers deliver coconut husk fiber to produce 100 tons o f allnatural material that replaces polyurethane in seat cushions, headrest, sun-visors, mats and other parts
of Brazilian-made Mercedes cars and trucks. The grant also allowed P O E M A to help 80 small scale
farming families adopt agricultural practices to preserve the pristine forest land in the Island o f
Marajb, located at the mouth o f the Amazon River. In exchange for training and inputs, the farmers
have agreed not to cut down additional trees from their property. POEMA i s monitoring this process.
SEBRAE (SErviqo BRAsileiro de Apoio 2s Micro e Pequenas Empresas or the Brazilian M i c r o and
In November 2002, IFC provided US$240,000 in grant to
Small Business Support Service)
strengthen SEBRAE’s capacity to better serve Brazilian micro and small entrepreneurs. SEBRAE i s
IFC’ s partner in providing training for youth with disadvantaged backgrounds to develop entrepreneurs, in a program with the Odebrecht Foundation and Youth Business International.
Instituto Terra - Instituto Terra, a Brazilian non-profit organization, was created in 1998 to promote,
develop, and implement the preservation and reforestation o f the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest (Mutu
AtlBnticu) in the R i o Doce Valley. Through i t s education and outreach activities, the organization
works with community leaders, landowners, local authorities, and cooperatives o f rural producers, to
rescue the degraded ecosystem and build a sustainable development model which would help preserve and reconstitute the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest while developing agricultural production. In
November 2002, in support o f their new initiative to identify and develop environmentally and socially sustainable business in the area, IFC provided a US$150,000 grant. IFC contributed another
US$30,000 grant to prepare a training curriculum for a vocational school program on topics related to
agronomy, environment, and agriculture.

Odebrecht AIDS program IFC Against AIDS Under an IFC project with a Brazilian company,
Odebrecht, an AIDS program was launched in Angola in September 2002. The program established
five operating sites throughout the country. First, an awareness campaign was undertaken for the
employees (mostly men) and targeted specific groups (women and families - to prevent the transmission o f the virus from mother to child). The campaign got a wider impact with the support o f the
Luanda “Bahian”, a Brazilian advertising agency, originally from Salvador (as Odebrecht), contracted
by the Angolan Ministry of Communication. The agency which witnessed the initial phases o f the
Odebrecht’s AIDS program subsequently developed a film series on AIDS under their contract with
the government. The films were broadcasted on local television with a general focus in Angola.
They included a section dedicated to the corporate efforts, where IFC and the Odebrecht’s program
are featured. Second, special cares for female staff and women in the community have been systematically offered since IFC’ s intervention. These cares include a special health management track
available for all female staff, organized women’s discussion groups, training on health, STDs and
HIV/AIDS, an HIV test for pregnant women, and adoption b y the company o f an antiretroviral protocol to reduce the transmission from expectant woman to infant.
IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility (INCaF) INCaF was created, along with a few other World
Bank Group carbon credit facilities, to support a market-based approach to reduce greenhouse gas
emission, being developed under the Kyoto Protocol, Clean Development Mechanism. Industrialized
countries that ratify the Protocol w i l l be required, once the agreement comes into force, to reduce
emissions they produce domestically. These countries can also comply with their Protocol obligation
partly b y purchasing carbon credits from projects in developing countries. For developing countries
the sale o f carbon credits w i l l encourage the transfer o f cleaner technologies at an effectively reduced
cost. In February 2003, INCaF signed a €15m deal to purchase 5 million tons o f carbon dioxide
emission reductions from V&M do Brasil, a leading producer and exporter o f seamless steel tubes one o f the largest carbon credit transactions so far. INCaF’s conditional commitment will allow
V&M to continue to produce steel using carbon-neutral charcoal from sustainably grown eucalyptus
instead o f switching to carbon-intensive coke in i t s production process. In this carbon finance transaction, IFC also facilitated a sale o f 400,000 tons o f emission credits b y V&M to Toyota Tsusho Corporation o f Japan.

MIGA

T o date, MIGA has facilitated an estimated US$9.4 billion in foreign direct investment into Brazil, which includes US$953 for a dual country project. Brazil i s MIGA’s largest Host Country for Guarantees, with a total gross exposure of US$996.9 million as o f June 30, 2003, which includes US$170.6
million o f co-insurance through the Cooperative Underwriting Program (CUP). Gross exposure to Brazil
accounts for 16.3 percent o f MIGA’s gross portfolio. Total net exposure, after reinsurance, stands at
US$265.5 million or 8.3 percent of MIGA’s net portfolio as o f June 30, 2003. The relative large amounts
o f co-insurance and reinsurance i s indicative o f the private sector insurance mobilization at medium and
long-term maturities which MIGA has been able to support. MIGA’s portfolio in Brazil remains concentrated in the financial sector (which accounts for 52 percent of net exposure) and the power sector (which
accounts for 21.4 percent o f net exposure). At the beginning o f FY04, MIGA requested Board approvals
for two electric energy transmission. In addition, MIGA has been active in relatively small deals in
manufacturing and agribusiness that support investments into local small and medium-sized firms.
MIGA continues to receive requests for guarantee coverage for projects in Brazil in all economic
sectors. However, given scarce capacity (due to country l i m i t s resulting from MIGA’ s Operational Regulations approved b y the Board), MIGA has been trying to leverage i t s capacity in the most efficient way
possible and bring private participants more fully into medium-term insurance in Brazil. Given the high
absolute level o f FDI going to Brazil, the private political insurance market also faces some capacity con-

133

straints, particularly for longer-tenure transactions. MIGA i s well aware o f the continued importance of
FDI to Brazil’s balance and payments and continues to utilize i t s capacity and relationship with insurance
market participants to support foreign investments in the country.

As part of the agency’s ongoing support to the country’s investment promotion efforts, MIGA w i l l continue to profile potential investment opportunities in Brazil through i t s online investment services, namely
PrivatizationLink and FDI Xchange. Also during the upcoming CAS period, MIGA may conduct an assessment to determine the feasibility o f developing sub-national capacity building programs for investment promotion intermediaries in Brazil.

ANNEX 6: CAS Consultations

In agreement with the Brazilian Government, the Brazil country team undertook consultations for
the preparation o f this CAS with members of Congress, the Governors and State Secretaries o f numerous
states, members o f the Council of Social and Economic Development (CDES), academics, civil society
representatives, members o f the international community (embassies and other multilateral aid organizations), members o f youth organizations, union representatives, and leaders o f the Catholic Church
(CNBB). These meetings took place from June to October 2003. The consultations included several
dozen meetings with several hundred individuals. In addition, during the preparation o f the Private Sector
Strategy o f the CAS, IFC and Bank staff consulted with representatives o f the private sector, the financial
sector, and industrial associations.
A key conclusion of these consultations, which were widely appreciated, was that an ongoing participatory process o f consultation, including the eventual growth o f a learning forum or development network, was not only in demand within civil society but would also strengthen the program and i t s responsiveness to Brazil’s needs. The Bank i s building this ongoing consultative process in coordination with
CDES and with a number o f interested international and domestic partners, including youth movements,
and expects to take advantage o f GDLN and web-based networks.
The commonalities o f messages as well as systematic differences are striking. On the goals for
Brazil’s development, there was a great deal o f convergence and endorsement o f the directions o f the
CAS. The differences emerge more when i t comes to the means and actions required to achieve Brazil’s
development goals. Some o f the highlights o f discussion with specific groups:
Civil society networks and NGO representatives felt that the consultative process would benefit from a joint discussion with the government and the Bank periodically. CSO and NGO groups seek
greater involvement in the definition of economic policy, where decisions on Brazil’s role in what i s considered the new global world order are being decided. Brazilian civil society i s well prepared and well
organized and can play a key role, moreover, as a “watchdog” in terms o f policy and program implementation, provided i t has access to timely and transparent information. The Bank could also play an important role in helping to support mainstreaming o f social, environmental and cultural concerns into the government’s development plans and programs. These plans and programs should take more explicitly into
account the social, cultural and environmental costs o f productive, infrastructure and other activities.

The Council o f Social and Economic Development, a group of council members from all segments of Brazilian leadership, chaired by the Minister o f the Council o f Economic and Social Development, expressed appreciation for the Bank’s desire to incorporate the opinions o f civil society and the
the need for investments in university education to
public sector into the CAS. Comments included: (i)
the importance of culture to the effectiveness o f a country’s development model
stimulate innovation; (ii)
and results; (iii)
the desire to hold consultations on an on-going basis between the public and private sectors and the Bank; and (iv) the need for continued evaluation o f public programs. A follow-up consultation discussed culture and violence, social participation, and the monitoring and evaluation o f programs in
a results context. In response to the request for continued consultation, the Bank w i l l be participating in
discussions with the Council in each o f Brazil’s five macro-regions during 2003-04 to continue this network of information sharing.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

135

The meetings with the representatives of local governments and NGOs from the North and
Northeast (Rede N6s) revolved around access to land, the need for irrigation, and raising agricultural
productivity. T o improve the impact o f social programs in the region, municipal and state governments
could benefit from investments in upgrading their institutional and administrative capacities. A focal
point was that many municipalities and states had successful programs, but needed more resources and
greater capacity to increase scale and impact.
The consultations with academics and members of Congress emphasized priorities ranging
from the need to pursue microeconomic reforms such as an improved investment climate to foster growth
and jobs, to the need for agriculture reform and support for family farming. There was general agreement
that the new Government was having success with macroeconomic policies for stabilization, but that microeconomic reforms, to remove distortions and logistical constraints and to strengthen the regulatory
environment, were also needed.

At the meeting with the international community, representatives o f embassies and multilateral
organizations generally agreed on priorities for the country, and focused instead on the role o f the international community. International aid plays a relatively small role in Brazil. More important i s the knowledge and experience that the international community can share. To this extent, the participants agreed to
meet regularly several times each year to discuss their assistance programs to ensure better coordination
and synergy in support o f Brazil’s development goals.
The consultation with youth organizations highlighted the importance of education, support to
businesses and enterprises started by youth, and programs to reduce violence in local communities.
Rather than creating new local programs, i t was mentioned that i t would be more effective to raise successful local programs to greater scale. This consultation also emphasized building on the morals and
values o f the nation’s youth, supporting their creativity and idealism, and taking advantage o f the “anything i s possible” spirit to stimulate innovation. The consultation stressed the lack o f opportunities to
channel the energy and creative spirit of youth and the need to change this situation.
In sum, the vision of a more equitable, sustainable and competitive Brazil was well received
during the consultations, an important reconfirmation of the goals. As to the means, CDES focused
on top priorities and inter-linkages to get early results, the international community on partnerships, academics on microeconomic and regulatory reforms for growth, c i v i l society on scale and replication o f
what was already working, and youth on fundamental issues o f values.

The present CAS incorporates many of these key ideas and suggestions, allowing it to be
much more reflective of Brazil’s priorities and approaches. There i s emphasis not only on overcoming the risks that Brazil s t i l l faces, but also taking advantage o f opportunities relating to Brazil’s true
wealth. These opportunities push the envelope o f the possible - be it through greater attention to education, entrepreneurship, culture, or natural resources. The CAS also builds in processes o f social cohesion,
participation, youth movements, and public-private partnerships. What has emerged i s a much more dynamic CAS, far more attuned to the real possibilities in Brazil than would have been apparent in the absence o f these consultations.

This Annex presents in further detail a thematic summary of the comments received during the
CAS consultation meetings, which have complemented the ongoing process o f Bank staff discussions and
consultations with a larger number o f individuals inside and outside o f Government. The comments bel o w should not be interpreted as a comprehensive or official representation o f any groups or views. Their
reproduction does not imply an endorsement b y the World Bank.

A MORE
EQUITABLE
BRAZIL
Investing in culture, and creating stronger linkages between culture, education and employment i s of great
importance to improving equity.

.
.

A country’s culture - i t s history, people and politics and natural environment - i s a key element in i t s
economic development and should be explicitly protected and built into its development strategy.
(CSOs and NGOs, CDES)
Culture i s a basis for employment and income generation (e.g., historic and eco-tourism, marketing of
local handicrafts). (CDES)
Further investments in education could include cultural elements, reinforcing moral and ethical values
among youth. (CDES)

Social programs focusing on income and employment could benefit from greater integration and monitoring and should also embrace a broader conception o f well-being.
What matters i s not only employment and income, but also education, culture, and leisure. These are
fundamental aspects of social well-being. (CDES)
Eliminating poverty requires a multi-sectoral approach that leverages the different comparative advantages o f each o f Brazil’s macroregions. (CDES)
I t i s important to create the conditions at least for nutritional self-sufficiency among Brazil’s poor, by
establishing the necessary basic social infrastructure and facilitating microcredit that can help with income generation. (CDES)
Consolidating income and employment programs could be an important step, especially in the agricultural/food sector. Support to the agriculturaVfood sector could help address two challenges simultaneously: lack of employment and lack o f nutritional self-sufficiency in certain areas. (Rede N6s)
Improving the capacity o f women, through education and training, could become an important subcomponent o f the various bolsa (cash transfer) programs. Studies show that women tend to spend a
greater share o f their resources investing in children and on household necessities. Incorporating female education and training into the bolsa programs could improve the efficacy o f these programs.
(CDES)

I Investing in the prevention and reduction o f crime and violence merits greater attention.
Crime and violence are crosscutting issues. Reducing crime and violence requires prevention as well
as enforcement. I t i s not a matter o f “combating” crime and violence, but instead o f investing in programs for their reduction. (International Community)
Crime and violence are among the greatest challenges confronting the nation’s youth. Community
groups, especially in poorer communities, struggle to keep youth away from organized crime, prostitution, and drugs. (Youth)
Lower (or lack of) growth could result in higher crime, and general unrest and popular opposition to
reforms. (Private sector)
Reducing crime and violence requires a short and long-term vision. In the short run, i t i s necessary to
implement programs and reforms that create j o b opportunities for youth and pull youth away from
crime and violence. In the long-term, measures could focus on early childhood interventions and cultural and after-school activities to keep kids away from the perverse influence o f crime and drugs.
(Youth, CDES)
Crime reduction also requires judiciary reforms that relieve bottlenecks in the criminal justice system.
(CDES)

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

.

137

The World Bank could act collaboratively with the Government to develop crime prevention and reduction programs. This also requires national coordination o f the various social programs to make
sure they target poor and crime-ridden areas. (CDES)

I t i s important to incorporate the opiniondrecommendations o f excluded groups in policy-making in order
to develop more effective and better-targeted social programs.

.
.
.
.

Poverty has a gender (female) and a race (Afro-descendants), and this should be more explicitly
addressed in poverty alleviations strategies. (CSOs/NGOs)
The question o f diversity and race, and i t s link with access to opportunities, may receive greater
attention in Brazil’s social agenda. The sharing o f international experiences with affirmative action and quota systems may be an important input to this debate (AcademicsParliamentarians)
I t i s important to promote the institutionalization o f policies and projects to develop the selfesteem o f youth, through employment, education, and on-going consultations. (Youth)
I t would be worthwhile and efficient to develop a network where youth could propose and comment on policies oriented toward them and help policy makers refine and scale-up those policies
that are effective. (Youth)

A MORE
SUSTAINABLE BRAZIL

I All develoDment should be sustainable development.

.
.

The importance o f promoting environmental sustainability cannot be seen only in the context o f ensuring future competitiveness and the availability o f natural resources for future use. The environment represents a natural heritage that i s important to protect for i t s own sake. (CDES)
The government’s plans and programs, including the PPA, should be more fully aligned with the vision o f sustainability. Environmental, social and cultural costs to specific development plans and projects should be more carefully weighed. (CSOs/NGOs)

The environment i s part o f Brazil’s natural heritage. I t i s important for i t s own sake as well as for i t s economic and social value. Environmental sustainability can be advanced more effectively through regional
and local measures.
Natural resource management i s a priority for the entire country, not only for the North and Northeast
regions. Local and regional programs aimed at environmental management might be more effective.
(CDES)
Agricultural reform and access to land are important for equality and environmental sustainability in
Brazil. (Rede N6s)
Agrarian reform has taken place decades ago in many other countries and not yet in Brazil. It i s essential for equity and sustainability, and Brazil has the chance to learn the lessons o f others.
(CSOs/NGOs)
Investing in measures to make agriculture more intensive and productive may reduce the pressure for
extensive agriculture, which can have substantial environmental ramifications. (International Community)
Even though the rate of deforestation has increased in the past year, i t has done so only in areas that
were not protected. In PPG7/ARF’A areas, deforestation has decreased significantly, suggesting that
these projects are having a positive effect. (International Community)
The IFC i s very useful in setting high environmental standards. (Private Sector)

138

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Regional strategies could capitalize on the strengths o f each region, with support for the development of
local priorities. In rural areas, support for family farming and agricultural reform could lead to more substantial gains in productivity.

.

.

.
.
.
.

Regional strategies could focus on the opportunities and not weaknesses o f each region. An example
would be the development o f scientific uses for the Amazon’s resources. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
Tourism expansion could generate more employment, especially in the Northeast and among youth.
(Rede N6s)
I t would be important to raise the level o f debate on agrarian reform and the provision o f land to rural
families. The lack of opportunities in rural areas force many youth from rural families to search for
work in urban areas. Agrarian reform could relieve some o f the pressures for migration. (Youth)
Family farming could be more commercially oriented with channels for bringing products to market.
(AcademicsParliamentarians)
One o f the greatest challenges limiting greater agricultural productivity i s the lack o f irrigation and
the lack of training and agricultural extension courses. (Rede N6s)
The Rural Programs to Combat Poverty (Programas de Combate B Pobreza Rural, PCPRs) that the
Bank has been implementingcould be expanded and scaled-up to other areas. (Rede N6s)

A well-formulated municipalkities strategy i s important in addressing growing urban poverty, and help
address some of the challenges posed by migration from rural areas.

.
.
.

A key issue i s the link between urban migration, poverty, and violence. Migration to large cities
places a greater burden on local services. (AcademicsFarliamentarians)
I t would be important to develop a policy of support to medium-sized cities, especially with regard to
priorities that are critical for medium-sized cities to be able to absorb more migrants and grow efficiently. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
In the largest cities, i t would be useful to implement integrated strategies focusing on slum upgrading, water, sanitation, transport, housing, and public safety. (Rede N6s)

A MORE
COMPETITIVE BRAZIL
Growth w i l l help generate support for the Government’s reform program, and i s the only way to ensure
gains in social welfare, however, there are costs.

.
.
..
.

Social policy alone i s unlikely to resolve Brazil’s challenges; Brazil also needs growth. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
Lack o f economic growth poses an important political risk. There i s a need to raise the level o f the
growth debate. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
Failure to spread the benefits o f growth could threaten growth itself. (Private sector)
T o have real income growth and to generate political support for the Government, Brazil would need
about 3 percent annual economic growth. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
Productivity gains have caused loss in jobs. (CSOslNGOs)

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

139

Continued investment in education, especially secondary and university education, with links to innovation and employment, would encourage a knowledge-based economy, making Brazil more competitive
and stimulating long-term growth.

.
.

.
m

Brazil should place greater emphasis on developing a knowledge-based economy. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
Public spending on universities i s important to the extent that i t advances innovation and promotes
technological development. This kind o f public spending should not be evaluated solely from the
viewpoint o f enhancing equity. (CDES, Youth)
It i s important to stimulate greater progression to university education, through more investment in
primary and secondary education (CDES)
Programs for the technological inclusion o f youth should be scaled-up. (Youth)
Programs and policies could focus on refining the capacity of youth and developing their entrepreneurial skills. Methodologies for incubating new enterprises started b y youth should be considered.
(Youth)
The growth sectors o f the next few years are those which are labor intensive, such as mining and services. Perspectives are also good in steel, aluminum, pulp and paper, and agribusiness. (Business
Associations)

Microeconomic distortions and logistics constraints prevent a faster and more robust resumption o f
growth. Greater sustainability of growth requires progress in this area.

.

.

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

High interest rates, exacerbated b y very high spreads, pose an important challenge to growth and development. Insufficient competition in the financial sector, and financial sector taxation exacerbate
this situation. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
The “custo Brasil” has increased over the last four years due to higher tax burdens and interest rates.
(Business Associations)
Access to financing i s the main obstacle to growth and investment. (Private Sector, Business Associations)
The high cost o f financing i s due to public financing needs. (Financial Sector)
There i s much discussion in Brazil o f the need to reduce interest rates to stimulate growth. This can
be achieved, in part, through the passage o f the bankruptcy law. (International Community)
The availability o f medium- to long-term financing w i l l improve as confidence in economic policies
and stability increases, and as country risk perception decreases. (Private sector)
With monetary easing, Brazil i s likely to resume growth, but the sustainability o f this growth depends
on microeconomic reforms. (AcademicsParliamentarians)
Among the key bottlenecks in the way o f resumed growth are distortions in the tax system. (Private
Sector, Business Associations, AcademicsParliamentarians)
In order to improve Brazil’s competitiveness, i t i s important to improve the regulatory framework,
especially in regard to infrastructure development. (International Community)
A possible concern for investors i s the regulatory environment, where r i s k s have been increasing.
The different roles between the Government and the regulatory agencies remain confused. The policy-making role should remain with the ministries and should not shift to the regulatory agencies.
(AcademicsParliamentarians)
There are serious logistics constraints, with excess reliance on road transport and bottlenecks in the
rail system. The Bank could help in the development o f intermodal transport to remove bottlenecks.

Lack o f investments in transport and energy are impediments to growth and competitiveness. New
investments must be accompanied by provision for maintenance. (Private Sector, Business Associations)
Greater agricultural productivity, especially in the Northeast, requires investments in maintaining,
upgrading, and possibly expanding water infrastructure. (CDES)
There i s a possible risk that public banks and companies could be used to spur development. Without
any fundamental and structural improvements, however, this development may only be short-lived.
(Academicsh’arliamentarians)

The implementation o f reforms that create conditions favorable for private sector investment, facilitate
adherence to laws and contracts, and stimulate human capital accumulation could promote the sustained
resumption o f growth and assure that this growth benefits a greater share o f the population.
Wealth i s generated primarily by the private sector. This being the case, private firms need to have
favorable conditions to expand operations, and workers need to have adequate preparation to benefit
from these expansions. (CDES)
To improve competitiveness and cooperation, i t i s important to have greater flexibility in labor’legislation and to reach a more sustainable equilibrium between incentives for physical capital and labor.
(CDES)
Along with stimulating greater competition, Brazil should also foster opportunities for cooperation
and synergy between firms, between universities and the private sector, and between the public and
private domains. (CDES)
Greater support to up-start firms could reduce the number o f firms that fail after only a short period o f
time. Brazil should have as a priority the implementation o f policies that facilitate access to credit for
small and medium-sized firms. (CDES)
T o improve both the quality and rate o f economic growth, i t i s important to help small producers gain
access to capital markets. (Rede N6s)
Judicial reform i s important to improving competitiveness in the long-term. Modernization o f the
legal framework and the removal o f judicial bottlenecks i s likely to have a positive effect on investment and national competitiveness. (CDES)
Enforcement o f security (collateral) does not work well. Judicial discretion favors continuance o f
debts. (Financial Sector)

Brazil needs to institutionalize a culture o f monitoring and evaluation with the use o f specific indicators. The availability of high-quality and consistent indicators could help in policy-making and
evaluation. (CDES)
Brazil, perhaps with Bank assistance, should undertake a comprehensive study to evaluate social programs, expand those that are effective, and phase-out those that are ineffective. (CDES)
Greater social participation and “co-responsibility” between the public sector and society for policymaking and implementation could increase the effectiveness o f social programs. This requires transparency and the availability o f good data on public programs. (CDES)
Continual consultations between the public and private sectors, organized civil society, and the Bank
could serve as an input to improve the effectiveness o f public policies. These kinds o f consultations
should also be encouraged at regional, state, and local levels. (CDES)

ANNEX 7: A Contribution t o Development Strategy for the Northeast

CHALLENGES
Two main challenges for the Northeast are (1) the permanence of deep poverty, and (2) social and
economic inequality both within the Northeast and compared with the rest o f Brazil.
The Northeast i s home to 28 percent of the Brazilian population and over half of Brazil’s
poor. In the Northeast, roughly half o f the population i s poor, while in Brazil overall, one-fifth live in
poverty. The rural Northeast i s the largest source o f poverty in the country, with nearly 12 million people
living below a poverty line. Through continuous rural-urban migration, rural poverty reinforces the number o f poor in urban areas, including small and medium cities, the major metropolitan regions, and cities
outside the Northeast, like Siio Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia.
When compared to other regions, all social indicators are less favorable in the Northeast.
On average, per capita income in the Northeast i s barely half o f Brazil’s. While the average Brazilian
worker has 6.3 years o f schooling, the average worker in the Northeast has only 4.5 years o f schooling.
Infht mortality rates in the Northeast are over 53 deaths per thousand live births, compared with 35 for
Brazil. While 78 percent o f Brazilians have access to tap water, only 66 percent o f those in Northeast
have similar access.
Intra-regional inequality i s an even more serious challenge. Within the Northeast, there i s
great variation among states, among cities o f different sizes, and between rural and urban areas. Social
intra-regional inequalities are high. Indicators o f education, health, and sanitation are invariably worse in
rural as compared to urban areas and in small as compared to large cities.
One of the most striking indicators of poverty and inequality in the Northeast i s related to
the share of the labor force working in agriculture. Agriculture accounts for only 9 percent o f regional
GDP but employs 36 percent o f the workforce. The large number o f l o w productivity rural workers and
small farmers contribute greatly to the poverty count in the region and in Brazil overall. They usually live
in rural areas or in small cities whose economic base i s rooted in rain-fed, l o w productivity and risky agricultural cultivation. Most o f the income in such cities originates from federal and state government
transfers and from pension programs for older rural workers.
POLICY RESULTS AND LESSONS

Poverty and inequality have been persistent challenges in the Northeast. This drought prone
region first raised the attention o f policy makers during serious droughts in the 19* century. During the
last 50 years, the Northeast has been a laboratory for a broad range o f experiences on regional development policies that have inspired the creation o f new institutions, development programs, infrastructure,
and incentives for the private sector.
The Bank has been associated with these experiences since the 1970s, when i t first opened an
office in Recife and started supporting the Federal Government’s integrated rural development strategy.
Since then, the Bank has been working continuously in the Northeast, supporting rural development projects, community driven projects, irrigation, urban development, infrastructure, water resource management, micro-credit, education, health, and sanitation, plus a number o f important non-lending activities.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

143

The results of Government policies and W o r l d Bank support have been largely positive. The
region i s now less vulnerable to drought, and the economy has shifted increasingly to less vulnerable activities. Agriculture accounted for 30 percent o f regional GDP in the 1960s and accounts for less than 10
percent today - although i t still remains a source of vulnerability in the region. More than 30,000 rural
communities have been directly supported. There has been substantial progress on infrastructure, with
new installations for transportation, communications, energy, water resources, sanitation, manufacturing,
medical services, and tourism. GDP has increased and social indicators have improved. During droughts,
relief programs have been able to address the needs of vulnerable populations. New irrigation schemes
have finally proven successful, and the manufacturing sector i s able to compete on a national level. Human capital has increased, and new social capital has been formed. On the environmental side, there have
been institutional improvements, but the pressure on the natural resources has been increasing. Major
progress has been made, but major challenges s t i l l exist.
Successful projects have involved simplified institutional arrangements, broad stakeholder
participation, and have been prepared early during government administrations. These lessons are
important to guide new policies for the region. Some lessons have to do with ownership. For instance, the
early integrated rural development projects were financed b y the federal government, coordinated b y
Sudene and implemented by state project units that would follow the guidance o f Sudene and the Bank,
often bypassing state administrations. The result was lack o f state ownership and lack o f political support.
Projects with complex institutional arrangements did not function well.

On the other hand, projects where the state government i s the borrower and projects that
start at the beginning of state administrations have a better chance of success. If project preparation
takes too long, the elected decision maker may lose interest. And projects with strong stakeholder participation are more likely to be successful because they have a larger base o f constituency support.
Experience also reveals a need to improve the focus and integration of projects. W i t h regard
to integration, initial strategies failed due to institutional complexity. The Bank i s now in the process o f
devising new approaches to improve inter-sectoral and inter-institutional integration while keeping ownership and accountability well-defined. An ART jointly organized by the Bank and the Government o f
CearA showed that there i s ample space to improve results on the ground with better integration and focalization.

With scarce resources and many priorities, there i s a need for selectivity.
STRATEGIC

APPROACH

The strategy for the Northeast visualizes a more sustainable future, with a more equitable society, a
more competitive economy, without poverty, and with less inequality. A more sustainable Northeast
encompasses sustainability on an environmental, social, economic and political level.
Social Sustainability
The principal priority i s to invest in people, with a heavy focus on education. From a longterm perspective, education i s the main necessary - though not sufficient - factor to induce development.
There are a few nations with high levels o f education that s t i l l have high poverty rates, but there are n o
nations that have l o w levels o f education and l o w poverty rates. Also, in the Northeast, lack o f education
i s closely associated with poverty and inequality. Education takes center stage in the strategy for the
Northeast and includes early childhood education, universal provision o f high-quality primary and secondary education, and capacity building at various levels.

144

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Universal access to health services, water and sanitation, public safety, justice, culture, and
social safety nets are also priority policies for social sustainability. In the short run, i t i s very important to strengthen social safety nets in order to protect the poor from various types o f crises, especially
droughts.
Environmental Sustainabilitv
Environmental sustainability should be a pillar of the new strategy. Traditionally, development plans in the Northeast have neglected the environment. Priorities are: land use planning, natural
resources and environmental management, conservation o f biodiversity, programs to prevent desertification in the semi-arid region, and the institutional development and strengthening o f government agencies
responsible for managing natural assets.
Water resource management i s key to induce sustainable use of this scarcest resource in the
semi-arid region.
Land-use policies, both r u r a l and urban, are essential to avoid natural resource degradation
and to facilitate other important policies such as land reform and urban development.
Economic Sustainabilitv
Economic growth with quality i s the main force to combat poverty. In the Northeast, economic growth i s heavily associated with economic performance in the rest of the country. I t i s important
that Brazil grow in order for the Northeast to grow.
However, there i s space and there are instruments to induce higher rates of growth and especially to improve the quality of growth and create more j o b opportunities within a sustainable
framework. Instead o f focusing on “what to promote”, policies should emphasize the “how” and the
“what for”. For instance, how to manage government incentives - at federal, state, and municipal levels in a way that decisions b y entrepreneurs to choose activities for which the region has a comparative advantage and choose technologies to maximize job creation while remaining competitive. Knowledge
management, and knowledge for development, must be considered as key components o f the Northeast
Strategy.

There are some sectors that have already proven potentially advantageous. Small and medium enterprises and tourism are examples. As for agriculture, the potential for irrigation i s limited: only
3 percent o f the Northeast can be irrigated, taking into account soil and water availability. This i s approximately one million hectares, and if managed properly, can have a large impact on regional development. The remaining 97 percent can focus on rain-fed cultivation, forestry, and biodiversity conservation,
among other activities. This has profound implications on the future o f development in the Northeast, on
population distribution, and on land use in the semi-arid region.
Political and Institutional Sustainabilitv

The participation of civil society, including the role of various councils and committees at
regional, state and municipal levels, i s very important for the creation of social capital and more
effective public policies. Together with the development o f institutions - for instance, in water management - greater participation also contributes to more continuity in public policies, as long as a public constituency can safeguard good policies during periods o f government transitions.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

145

Improving governance and transparency in public institutions and fostering greater “social
control” b y independent organizations i s important to induce correct use of public resources and
more effective public policies.
Capacity building i s necessary to strengthen the ability of the major stakeholders in the development process of the Northeast, especially at the municipal level.
THE BANKAND THE STRATEGY

The Bank will use all the array of instruments at i t s disposal to support the Northeast Strategy. In doing this, the Bank w i l l work to increase the synergy of the various programs and projects in a
given area. For this, the Bank w i l l be looking for ways to improve the inter-sectoral and inter-institutional
integration o f different actions. For instance, the Bank already finances federal and state water projects. In
the field, the Bank can help both federal and state agencies to explore the complementarities o f their projects, so as to increase their development impact.
The Bank will continue working with federal institutions that are important stakeholders in
the Northeast, including ministries and other agencies in Brasilia and the regional agencies, especially
Sudene and Banco do Nordeste.
In the states, the Bank will foster state development strategies and identify the key actions
that are missing and necessary to strengthen impact. While the Bank may continue to finance sectoral
activities, these must now fit under an integrated, strategic framework. The state projects may also include
cross-cutting components aimed at improving the overall capacity o f the state to manage i t s resources, to
plan i t s strategies, and to monitor and evaluate projects.

The Bank will pay increasing attention to municipalities and w i l l work either directly with
larger ones, or indirectly - through federal and state institutions - with the medium and smaller ones, to
help improve the effectiveness of targeted policies to reduce poverty and inequality at local levels.

The Bank will leverage various types of investment lending, technical assistance, knowledge
sharing, and capacity building. The Bank w i l l also work with partners to deliver on capacity building
and information sharing, with the support o f WBI, GDLN and networks like Muninet and Rede NOS.

ANNEX 8: A Strategic Contribution to a M o r e Sustainable A m a z o n

The Amazon i s large, sparsely populated and urbanized. The “Legal Amazon” covers some
60 percent (5.1 million km.2)of the Brazilian territory, with some 21 million inhabitants (in 2000) or
about 12 percent o f Brazil’s population. Almost 70 percent live in cities and towns as defined b y IBGE
(including very small municipal seats). The rural population declined in the 1990s with migration to the
urban centers. Migration to the region as a whole has subsided, but some influx, mainly from poor states
o f the Northeast and mainly into Pari, Amapfi and Roraima, continues. The indigenous population (about
350,000) appears to be recovering.
The region provides biodiversity and environmental services of national and global interest.
The Amazon i s the largest rain forest biome in the world, containing by far the largest portion o f remaining rain forest and up to one fifth o f the world’s freshwater. O f the original forest cover, some 640,000
km.2,or 17 percent, have been cleared b y 2002, although at least a third o f this area i s growing back. I t s
global value i s seen both in i t s extremely rich biodiversity (50,000 known species o f plants, 3000 o f fish,
2000 o f birds) and i t s possible impact on the global climate i f it were to disappear. Deforestation averaged about 21,000 km.2per year in the eighties (from 1978 - 88, representing a loss o f about 0.5 percent
o f the forest stock per year), and declined somewhat in the 1990s to 16,000 km.2per year. The latest estimate (for 2002) was 25,000 km.2 or 56 percent above the annual average for the 1990s.

CHALLENGES
The Amazon i s a diverse region that faces an equally complex set of challenges. Among
these, the most important are: a) a lack o f consensus about the rules o f the game for development; b) a set
o f development trade-offs and uncertainties; c) the sheer physical size o f the region, with special relevance for social services (health and education), infrastructure and transportation; d) unclear property
rights and ensuing land use conflicts; e) unmanaged expansion of cattle ranching and agriculture; f) rapid
urbanization and poor quality-of-life in cities; g) an inability to control deforestation and fires; h) a range
of serious human health challenges; i)the role o f indigenous people in economic development and environmental management; j) localized development questions, especially in the energy and mining sectors;
and k) the overarching challenge of l o w institutional capacity and poor governance.
The North i s Brazil’s second poorest region. 43 percent o f the region’s population lives in
poverty (this proportion i s only slightly lower than in the Northeast) and the region accounts for 5 percent
o f Brazil’s poor. Per capita income in the Amazon was 57 percent o f the national figure for the year
2000. Little i s known about the geographic distribution o f the poor within states, although i t i s clear that
the bulk o f them live in urban areas. More studies are needed to permit adequate targeting o f services.
Unlike the Northeast, hunger i s not the main problem. The main poverty challenge, particularly in the rural areas, i s access to especially health, education and other services, and economic opportunities. In terms o f education, over half the region’s population has less than four years o f formal schooling and the illiteracy rate o f the adult population (above 15 years o f age) i s 19 percent, compared with a
national average of 13.6 percent. In terms o f household services, 69 percent o f residences in the region
have piped water, 9 percent are connected to a sewerage system and 24 percent have solid waste collec-.
tion. Extreme dispersion o f the rural population in the forest areas makes provision o f such services difficult and costly; the rural poor spend considerable time and money traveling to centers with health and

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

147

education facilities. Geographic isolation also creates economic problems in terms o f access to markets,
high transportation costs and availability o f investment capital.
POLICY RESULTS AND LESSONS

The Bank has traveled a bumpy road to regional development. While the Bank does not have
a strategy o f i t s own, i t has been active in the region since the early 1980s through loan-funded projects
(regional development, health, mining, agriculture, and environmental management), since 1992 as trustee o f the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest (RFPP) and, more recently, as implementing agency o f the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The experience in the 1980s was not a happy one,
having a serious impact on the Bank’s reputation in a decade o f rapidly growing environmental concerns.
The positive experience with W P , however, has not only given the Bank a new confidence that i t i s
possible and not overly risky to work in the Amazon region, but has also contributed to a different image
o f the Bank and to expectations on the part o f the donor community that i t w i l l engage more actively as
the Bank (not only as trustee) in the region.

This journey has yielded valuable lessons. The Bank has learned the following substantive lessons about working effectively in the Amazon:
J

Recognize regional interests and trade-offs;

J

Create or strengthen institutions but don’t make them dependent on Bank assistance; and

J

Minimize the cost to Brazil o f conservation o f nature for global benefits.

In addition, Bank experience has reinforced lessons learned elsewhere such as the value o f a)
maintaining a poverty and participatory focus to i t s interventions; b) supporting and protecting ethnic and
cultural diversity; and creating a capacity to monitor, learn, evaluate, disseminate lessons and scale-up
successes. Procedurally, the Bank has learned that i t i s important to: a) identify and work with key actors;
b) make allowance for additional investments in time and technical assistance that are necessary for working in the Amazon; c) be selective, encouraging others to do what i t cannot and taking care about how to
phase interventions that involve both environmental conservation and development; and d) keep funding
and technical assistance simple.

STRATEGIC

APPROACH

Goal, objectives and principles for working in the Amazon. The overall goal of Bank support
should be to promote sustainable development in the Amazon region. This would consist o f the following
objectives: a) reducing urban and rural poverty (equity pillar); b) creating enabling conditions for economic development (productivity pillar); and c) conserving environmental resources (sustainability pillar). Contributions to support these objectives would be based on the following principles:
0

Focusing on the poorest areas o f the region and the consolidated frontier

0

Reducing free access to natural resources

0

Increasing the value o f the standing forest

0

Working in partnership with key stakeholders

148

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007

Drawing on these options, and guided b y the objectives, principles and lessons from experience
listed above, the Bank believes that it best contribute to sustainable development in the Amazon through
three lines o f action:

1. Poverty Alleviation (a more equitable Brazil) - pursue policies and investments in the Amazon to
increase income and improve living conditions for the urban and rural poor, especially in the consolidated frontier (RondBnia, Mato Grosso and Parfi), the poorest municipalities o f individual states and
the poorest neighborhoods of BelCm and Manaus.
2. Conditions for Economic Management (a more productive Brazil) - enhance institutional capaci t y (public, private and civil society), improve land use management and support environmentallysound economic activity and infrastructure, especially in the poorest areas o f the Amazon and in areas
o f serious or anticipated land use conflict.
3. Environmental Conservation (a more sustainable Brazil) - increase support for existing federal
and state policies and programs that seek to sustainably manage natural resources, conserve biodiversity and protect environmental services in the Amazon, with a geographic focus on areas characterized b y critical biodiversity value, crucial environmental services and/or cultural heritage.
Support in these areas would be through a range o f instruments: loans (federal, state, municipal); sector
work; policy analysis; knowledge management; and promotion o f partnerships.
THE BANKAND THE STRATEGY

Principled selectivity should guide the phasing of the Bank’s work in the region. The phasing o f this work should be guided b y a number o f principles. First, the Bank should start small and learn
from i t s initial experiences. For example, one o f the first operations in the new CAS period w i l l be the
Amapii Sustainable Communities project which i s a modest loan in a small state with relatively few conflicts. It also has a significant investment in monitoring and evaluation in order to learn lessons. Second,
the Bank should be geographically selective as opposed to trying to work throughout the region in a comprehensive way. Each action area includes suggestions about how to achieve this spatial selectivity. This
also implies financing select pieces o f a federal Amazbnia Sustentdvel program, perhaps through appropriate state and municipal initiatives. Finally, reality dictates that the timing o f our interventions w i l l be
driven to a certain extent by the demand for Bank involvement b y various clients. This demand i t s e l f w i l l
be conditioned b y the client’s political will, technical capacity, the electoral cycle, and creditworthiness
considerations. The latter can be seen as an important advantage for the Bank to pursue more lending in
the Amazon as they are among the more creditworthy Brazilian states.
Timely opportunities exist for the Bank to make a contribution. The major regional opportunity for guiding Bank contributions would be the Amazbnia Sustentdvel program, with i t s linkages to the
PPA. While i t i s unlikely that the Bank would finance all aspects o f such a program, i t could provide financial, technical and analytical support for a federal initiative as well as related state and municipal
components. Criteria could be established to help the Bank prioritize where support would be directed
according to the objectives of conservation, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. A second
opportunity w i l l be how the Bank responds to growing client demand for assistance in the Amazon. A
third opportunity would be for Bank assistance to the Government in i t s process o f reforming key financial and development mechanisms, i.e. ADA, BASA, FINAM, as well as BNDES and the Caixa
EconBmica Federal (for their involvement in the Amazon). Finally, the Bank can play a supporting role

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

149

through i t s involvement in the second phase o f the RFPP. In this regard, some suggestions are offered
below to assist with formulation o f the second phase.
Within the donor community, the Bank should exercise leadership through a region-wide
approach. Institutionally, an opportunity exists for the Bank to exercise leadership within the donor
community. Based on the positive experience o f donor coordination within the RFPP, a number o f donors have expressed interest in pursuing a sector-wide approach to aid, though the sector definition remains unclear. A more sensible and comprehensive approach would be to pursue a region-wide approach
to aid coordination in the Amazon. The Bank could take the lead in organizing donors around such a
concept and could serve as the secretariat to a regionally-focused aid group, including preparation of the
group’s assistance strategy.
The second phase of the RFPP could complement Bank support. The second phase of the
RFPP could be formulated in three blocks:
Think Tank. In order to support a region-wide approach, the main thrust o f the RFPP in i t s second phase should be to serve as a resource base that would: a) observe and assess trends in the
Amazon (e.g. deforestation, cattle ranching, soybean production, urbanization, poverty, etc.); b)
disseminate successful lessons and models from the Pilot Program projects; c) catalyze the mainstreaming o f positive experiences; d) analyze and suggest policies for sustainable development in
the Amazon; e) build capacity that would support these activities in c i v i l society organizations
and the private sector; and f ) maintain a clearinghouse o f work being done throughout the region.
This could be done through the creation o f a think tank capacity that would perform these functions. I t could be a network of institutions or even a new rainforest policy institute. In the latter
case, an institute would be an entity independent of the Brazilian Government but that would contribute to enriching Government policies and programs in the region, such as the role that PEA
plays for the Ministry o f Planning. In either case, i t should full involve existing initiatives for
learning lessons, conducting research and preparing policy analysis for the Amazon, either as
partners in a network or as board members o f an institute.
High-Priority Piloting. The RFPP should continue to pilot new experiences but in a limited and
focused manner. Specifically, the Program stakeholders at their most recent meeting (CuiabA,
June 2001) identified a number of specific knowledge gaps where the Program could support piloting work: low-impact cattle ranching and pasture management; land tenure, titling, management, and conflict resolution; rural extension for sustainable agriculture and production; and sustainable land settlement. The RFPP’s International Advisory Group, in i t s July 2003 meeting,
identified other promising areas such as support to small-scale producers, implementation o f an
effective forest concession system, payment for environmental services, management o f genetic
resources, and preservation and application o f traditional knowledge. Other areas include the intensification o f agriculture in degraded forest areas and the challenges o f natural resource management on indigenous lands. The current project-based approach has high transaction costs and
should be avoided in a second phase, either b y supporting and stimulating relevant work b y others
or through donor-supported projects that address these knowledge gaps via bilateral arrangements. The think tank capacity could be used to identify other knowledge needs and orient donor
and other resources.
Continued Learning and Scaling Up. The third block o f activity for the Program in i t s new
phase would be to carry existing projects to completion, learning and documenting lessons along
the way for mainstreaming. A number o f projects w i l l carry on through 2006/2007 such as the
Iproject. There w i l l be a continuing need to
Natural Resources Policy Project and the Science I

150

supervise the implementation o f these projects and evaluate them for replicable lessons, as well as
promoting the scaling up of successful experiences.
