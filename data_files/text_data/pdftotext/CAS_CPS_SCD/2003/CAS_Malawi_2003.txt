THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
Executive Summary

i.

Despite many years o f donor support, M a l a w i i s currently struggling to manage a
series o f severe crises, including flood and drought, widespread food insecurity, macroeconomic instability, strained relations with k e y donors, and numerous outstanding
govemance problems. M o s t o f the M i l l e n n i u m Development Goals (MDGs) are unlikely
to b e met. With disappointing results in implementing the reform agenda and repeated
delays in completing the first review o f the IMF’s PRGF arrangement, M a l a w i i s in the
l o w case. I t has become clear that business-as-usual will not achieve the results required.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:

I s the W o r l d Bank Group’s proposed support to the Government’s evolving
poverty reduction strategy appropriate and adequate?
A r e the triggers proposed for m o v i n g f r o m the l o w case to the base case (and the
high case) appropriate and realistic?

...

The Bank’s n e w Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presents a transitional
program that aims to help the Government to address the urgent development issues that
M a l a w i n o w confronts. The program i s organized under three pillars: (i)
strengthening
economic management; (ii)
establishing a platform for growth; and (iii)
improving
service delivery and strengthening the safety net. During the C A S period (FY04-06), the
B a n k will provide financing, totaling up to $105 m i l l i o n in the l o w case, for projects that
could succeed even i f the macroeconomic performance i s weak, as w e l l as analytical and
advisory services aiming to help achieve a small number o f critical outcomes needed to
restore Malawi’s development prospects. These outcomes include: (i)
reduced HIV
incidence; (ii)
macroeconomic stability; (iii)
selected agriculture reforms; and (iv)
improved delivery o f basic health and education services. If M a l a w i attains the base
case, lending could rise to as m u c h as $215 m i l l i o n and could include adjustment lending
as well as the development o f sector-wide approaches in the health and education sectors.
111.

The first C A S pillar aims to help strengthen economic management and achieve
iv.
macroeconomic stability. The ongoing Financial Management, Transparency and
Accountability project will help to improve procurement and financial management,
while the Privatization and Utility R e f o r m project will help to improve the investment
climate and reform Malawi’s loss-making parastatals. N e w lending w o u l d include a
Global Development Leaming N e t w o r k project ($5 million) and, if M a l a w i attains the
base case, one o r more adjustment operations ($30-40 million). Analytical work, in
either the l o w o r base case, will include a Country Procurement Assessment Review and
a Public Expenditure Review w h i c h will assess Malawi’s public sector capacity and focus
o n the management o f contingent liabilities and the medium-term wage policy.
The second C A S pillar involves establishing a platform for sustainable povertyv.
reducing growth. Three projects are proposed for the base case: a Community L a n d
Reform project ($25 million) that will p i l o t reforms intended to redistribute underutilized

land to the poor, an Infrastructure Services project ($40 million) aiming to expand rural
services required for growth, and an Agriculture project ($30 million) aiming to
restructure the Ministry o f Agriculture and improve competitiveness in the tobacco sector
(expected to remain the principal source o f growth in the medium-term). If M a l a w i
remains in the l o w case, the latter t w o projects will be reduced in scope and combined
into an Integrated R u r a l Income Generation project ($30 million) instead. Analytical
w o r k will include a Financial Sector Review and an Institutional Governance Review.
The third C A S pillar will support improved service delivery and an expanded
vi.
safety net. Core B a n k interventions will include an H I V / A I D S project and a third credit
supporting the M a l a w i Social A c t i o n Fund-proj ects prepared under the previous C A S
and able to b e implemented even in the l o w case-as w e l l as the Emergency Drought
Recovery Project, w h i c h will continue to support measures to prevent food insecurity. A
Health project ($15 million) and an Education project ($30 million) are also included.
Analytical w o r k in this area will include a Poverty Assessment as w e l l as country sector
reports in b o t h health and education, focusing o n aligning Government and donor
programs, improving implementation efficiencies, and monitoring outcomes.
M a l a w i will remain in the l o w case if macroeconomic stability remains elusive,
vii.
public expenditure deviates significantly f r o m PRSP policies, overall p o l i c y performance
i s unsatisfactory, o r portfolio performance i s poor for an extended period. The triggers
for attaining the base case include satisfactory progress towards achieving
macroeconomic stability; satisfactory implementation o f the poverty reduction strategy,
including maintaining pro-poor spending at agreed levels; satisfactory implementation o f
the H I V / A I D S program; and satisfactory implementation o f a suitable agricultural reform
program. The B a n k will monitor l o w case and base case triggers o n a continual basis.
Total base case financing o f $215 m i l l i o n w o u l d fully utilize Malawi’s current IDA
allocation; o f this, grant resources made available under the I D A 1 3 framework (about
$36 million) will be allocated to the Health and Education projects, as these projects will
have a strong human-development impact.

viii.
A high case scenario w o u l d result if, in addition to meeting the base case triggers,
macroeconomic stability i s achieved and maintained; structural reforms are aggressively
pursued in the agriculture sector; significant progress occurs in demonopolizing the
power, transport and telecommunications sectors; and portfolio performance i s strong.
Under this scenario, IDA financing could increase to as m u c h as $100 m i l l i o n per annum,
with additional resources allocated t o an Infrastructure Development project and possibly
a first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC), w h i c h will improve the predictability
and continuity o f IDA financing to Malawi’s development program.

Risks to C A S implementation include adverse political developments as M a l a w i
ix.
approaches n e w Presidential and parliamentary elections next year; continuing capacity
constraints; an insufficiently aggressive response to the H I V I A I D S epidemic; and
continuing vulnerability t o adverse exogenous developments such as flood, drought, o r
conflict. These risks are being mitigated through p o l i c y dialogue; stronger donor
coordination; and selected Bank-supported activities as set out in this CAS.

THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

1.

Introduction

1,
The last full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for M a l a w i (IDMR98-127) was
discussed by the B o a r d o n August 27, 1998, and a Progress Report (IDMR2000-21419)
was discussed o n December 21, 2000. The Government completed i t s first full Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in April 2002 and the Boards o f the World Bank and
the IMF endorsed the PRSP in August 2002; b o t h Boards expressed concerns about the
challenges o f implementation. The PRSP was prepared through a participatory process
i n v o l v i n g domestic stakeholders as w e l l as external development partners, including the
World Bank. Covering a five-year horizon, the PRSP describes Malawi’s
macroeconomic, structural and social policies and programs for promoting broad-based
growth and reducing poverty; i t also identifies associated external financing needs. The
PRSP indicates that increasing economic opportunities, enhancing governance, and
improving human capabilities are key actions for reducing poverty in Malawi.
This CAS, w h i c h outlines the Bank Group’s strategy for supporting the PRSP,
2.
reviews developments since the last C A S and the C A S Progress Report, analyses the
Bank’s experience in implementing i t s assistance strategy, and presents the B a n k Group’s
lending and non-lending program for FY04-06. M a l a w i reached the decision point under
the H P C initiative in December 2000 and most outstanding actions for reaching the
completion point are completed (see Annex D -Debt Sustainability); the k e y exceptions
are implementing the PRGF arrangement and reforming the Central Medical Stores,
w h i c h are b o t h expected to occur by end-2003.
Box 1: Poverty and Inequality
M a l a w i i s one o f the world’s poorest countries: per capita income i s just $170 per year; 60% o f
Malawians live below the poverty line; and income distribution i s extremely unequal.
F o o d insecurity remains widespread; the Government declared a famine emergency in February 2002.
The country i s unlikely to meet most o f the M i l l e n n i u m Development Goals, with the possible
exception o f primary school enrolment.
HIV prevalence, at 15% in the 15-49 age group, is alarming, and AIDS-related deaths have already
created an estimated 470,000 orphans and resulted in deterioration o f some key social indicators.
Female-headed households, which comprise one in four rural households, are among the poorest.
Because poverty i s deep and access to land, education, and other assets sharply unequal, large changes in
average incomes result in only s m a l l improvements in Malawi’s poverty indicators. To reduce poverty
against the backdrop o f increasing AIDS-related deaths, growth rates need t o approach 6% and be broadbased. Concerted efforts need to continue to improve social outcomes and to protect the poorest and most
vulnerable groups (e.g. through targeted employment schemes, food subsidies, and seed and fertilizer
distributions). In addition, the work burden o f girls and women (who continue to do the bulk o f farm and
house work, including rearing children and fetching water and firewood) needs to be reduced, and they
need to enjoy access to assets and levels o f well-being o n an equal basis with boys and men.

2.
2.1

Social, economic and political context
Social context

About 86% o f Malawi’s 10.8 m i l l i o n people l i v e in rural areas, and agriculture
3.
remains the k e y source o f income for 78% o f a l l Malawians. Poverty in M a l a w i i s
widespread and severe; nearly 60% o f Malawians lived below the poverty line in 2000.
During the 1990s, poverty levels remained largely unchanged, while urban poverty
increased. With a Gini coefficient o f 0.62, M a l a w i has one o f the highest incomedistribution disparities in the world. As a consequence o f poverty, most social indicators
are very l o w compared to the rest o f Africa. Only one in three children complete five
years o f education, and less than one percent attain a desirable level o f literacy. L i f e
expectancy i s just 42 years (having fallen recently as a result o f AIDS-related deaths); the
under-five mortality rate (U5MR) i s 183 per 1,000 l i v e births; malnutrition i s widespread
and nearly 49% o f children are stunted. Overall, social indicators are worse in rural areas
than urban areas.
M a l a w i i s divided into three administrative regions (southem, central, and
4.
northern) and 28 administrative districts o r local authorities, w h i c h were elected for the
first time in November 2000. The southem region i s the most urbanized and densely
populated; some southem districts have 307 people per square kilometer, compared to a
national average o f 105 and just 2 7 in the north. Urbanization trends indicate slowing
rural-urban and interregional migration.
Malawi’s poor share three important characteristics. First, they have larger
5.
households, o n average, in b o t h rural and urban areas. Second, fully one-third o f a l l poor
households are headed by women. These households are more vulnerable because they
have fewer adult workers, and w o m e n are less l i k e l y to find gainful employment, due to
local customs, than men. Third, the A I D S epidemic has created a rapidly growing group
o f orphans and foster children, n o w estimated to number about 470,000, w h i c h are
placing extraordinary demands o n some o f the poorest households. The worsening
economic and social conditions o f most Malawians call into question Malawi’s ability to
achieve the M i l l e n n i u m Development Goals (MDGs) (see Annex C).
The H I V I A I D S epidemic in M a l a w i i s one o f the most severe in Africa, and has
6.
touched every part o f the country. With an estimated one m i l l i o n adults and children
infected with HIV in 2001 (national prevalence i s estimated to b e about 8.4 percent, but
prevalence among adults aged 15-49 i s estimated t o be about 15 percent), M a l a w i has
more people living with H I V / A I D S than N o r t h America and Westem Europe combined.
General awareness o f the disease i s fairly high, but high-risk behavior continues due to
cultural traditions and the economic vulnerability o f poor females, in particular. W o m e n
are contracting HIV at a younger age than m e n and at higher prevalence rates (as m u c h as
four to six times higher in the 15-29 age group). M o s t transmission i s through
heterosexual contact (90 percent), with mother-to-child transmission a distant second (8
percent), but the very high rates o f HIV prevalence in women o f reproductive age (24%
o n average), combined with high fertility, suggests that future mother-to-child
transmission rates will increase significantly. AIDS-related deaths are rapidly depleting

-2-

the ranks o f k e y health and education employees as w e l l as the labor force more
generally, putting tremendous pressure o n an economy that has not been able to maintain
positive per capita growth over the last few years.
In 2002, Malawi-like m u c h o f southern Africa-also experienced an acute food
7.
emergency as a result o f drought during the previous growing season. IDA responded
with an Emergency Drought Recovery project (EDRP), w h i c h the B o a r d approved in
November 2002. F o o d relief operations as o f end-March 2003 were o n track and overall
acute malnutrition levels, affecting between 2% and 6% o f the population, had dropped to
about the level in normal years and well below the 15% threshold for an emergency. The
Government and i t s partners are currently considering adjustments to crisis response, as
maize sales by ADMARC at a subsidized price (Kw 17 per kilogram) are below
projections, reflecting good supply, but also a lack o f purchasing power in some parts o f
the country. WFP i s currently increasing free food distributions f r o m 3.2 m i l l i o n to 3.5
m i l l i o n people to cover some o f the population that i s unable to access ADMARC maize,
and a further expansion o f the humanitarian effort, using ADMARC’s surplus stocks, i s
under discussion. A decision o n the appropriate level o f reserve stocks will be made
when more information i s available about the n e w crop which, as o f M a y I,2003,
appeared to b e good. If reserve needs are judged to b e less than the currently available
stock, then the Government expects to initiate commercial sales within the region, where
some countries are s t i l l experiencing food deficits.

2.2

Economic context

8.
Although M a l a w i has succeeded in completing some k e y reforms since 1995,
progress since the last C A S (August 1998) and the C A S Progress Report (December
2000) has been mixed. Overall real growth f e l l sharply to -1.5% in 2001 and it i s
expected to b e 1.8% in 2002. Although annual inflation has been decreasing steadily (to
7.5% in December 2002), interest rates remain high at about 30%. F o l l o w i n g a 40%
depreciation in the real exchange rate between 1998 and 2000, i t appreciated 45% f r o m
January to October 2001 (22% against the US. dollar), m o s t l y due to the slide in the
rand, before commencing a controlled depreciation into 2002. An expansionary
monetary stance in late 2002 and l o w liquid-reserves levels that prevented the central
bank f r o m completing i t s seasonal intervention led to additional pressure o n the exchange
rate. The nominal rate depreciated by almost 8% in November-December 2002 against
the U S dollar. This situation was partly rectified with receipts f r o m t w o commercial
bridge loans w h i c h in early December permitted the central bank to resume i t s seasonal
foreign currency sales; but foreign reserves remain critically low, at less than t w o months
import coverage.
9.
Recent economic w o r k indicates that slow growth in M a l a w i results not f r o m i t s
development strategy, but f r o m failure to implement the strategy in detail and in the
envisaged sequence, w h i c h in turn has failed to reduce the r i s k s o f market participation
for Malawi’s k e y economic agents. The risks facing households, traders, entrepreneurs,
and financial institutions include in particular: (i)
an unstable macroeconomic
environment, characterized by high inflation and high and volatile real interest and
exchange rates w h i c h make input and output prices unpredictable; (ii)
significant and

unpredictable government interference in important markets (such as for maize and
fertilizer), w h i c h has undermined development o f a competitive private sector; and (iii)
weak and unreliable government services, with slow and incomplete government efforts
at improving the k e y cross-cutting utilities. Seeking economic security under these
conditions, farmers retreated into low-value subsistence crops; manufacturers downsized;
traders adopted collusive behavior and began to r e l y o n government contracts for most o f
their business; and financial institutions invested their resources in low-risk government
paper rather than marginally-bankable loans.
Recent agricultural performance has been poor, w i t h l o w growth f r o m 1984 to
10.
1988 and almost n o growth since then. This has had a profound negative impact o n the
economy, as agriculture accounts for nearly 90% o f foreign exchange earnings and 85%
o f employment (though only one-third o f GDP). As a result o f declining yields and
falling prices, profitability for most crops has declined sharply, affecting b o t h
smallholders (about 84% o f output comes f r o m smallholders farming less than one
hectare) and large- and medium-sized estates (which produce cash crops accounting for
about 16% o f output). A t the same time, the 1990s experienced a smallholder withdrawal
into low-risk low-value drought-resistant crops such as cassava, potatoes, and barley;
expansion into higher-value crops such as beans, pulses, and groundnuts was minimal. It
appears that weak agricultural performance has resulted f r o m three factors w h i c h create a
high-risk environment for smallholders: (i)
national food-security does not exist, even in
years o f good harvests (in five o f the last seven years, M a l a w i has had to import maize);
(ii)
the delivery o f agricultural services i s weak and unreliable: research and extension
remains under budgeted; land markets are underdeveloped, resulting in underutilization
o f one-third o f total arable land; fertilizer prices are 20% to 50% higher than in
neighboring countries, due to high transport costs and government intervention in the
market; and rural credit i s unprofitable, due to high interest rates and l o w repayment
rates; (iii)
the tobacco sub-sector, w h i c h accounts for 80% o f Malawi’s exports and will
remain the engine o f growth in the medium term, has suffered f r o m declining yields and
unreliable marketing arrangements (see B o x 2).
Formal manufacturing has not been able to compensate for l o w agricultural pro11.
ductivity. The sector i s small, employing o n l y about 3% o f Malawi’s 4.5 m i l l i o n laborers
and contributing about 13% o f GDP. With capacity utilization at about 50%, output contracted by 2.5% in 2001 and 1.O% in 2002. Private investment has also fallen, f r o m 8%
o f GDP in 1995 to o n l y 2.7% in 2000. Poor performance appears to stem f r o m a trade
and manufacturing environment that i s high-risk due to several factors: (i)
the macro
economy i s unstable, with high inflation and interest rates and highly volatile exchange
rates; (ii)
infrastructure services, including water, electricity and telecommunications, are
costly and unreliable; (iii)
duty drawbacks and rebates are complex, non-transparent, and
discretionary; and (iv) private and public institutions supporting the business community
are under budgeted and have unclear and overlapping mandates that make them
ineffective. With regard to the labor market and Core Labor Standards (CLS), Malawi’s
constitution eliminates forced labor, guarantees equal opportunity and non-discrimination
in employment, and permits freedom o f association. M a l a w i also prohibits child labor: i t
was one o f the first signatories o f I L O Convention No. 182, and the provision o f free

-4-

universal primary education since the election o f the first M u l u z i Government also helps
to discourage child labor.
Box 2: The Prospects for Agriculture in Malawi
To achieve poverty-reducing growth, smallholder agriculture in M a l a w i needs to reach i t s full
potential. In recent years, performance has been poor. A careful assessment o f inconsistencies in official
statistics suggests that national yields, far f r o m growing by 6% or more per annum since 1998 as previous
data suggest, probably stagnated, with the result that household spending and consumption remained
unchanged. While the late 1990s saw some crop diversification and a fourfold increase in smallholder
participation in burley tobacco, these achievements were offset by an overall decline in the estate sector and
declining productivity and profitability in almost every crop. Between 1995-96 and 2000-0 1, smallholder
gross margins declined sharply in burley tobacco, cassava, paprika, and groundnuts; only rice showed an
increase. While the causes include factors outside the Government’s control, such as poor rains and
unfavorable terms o f trade, improved performance will require a sustained effort t o tackle a l l contributory
factors in i t s control, including macroeconomic instability and the policy environment.
As tobacco still accounts for 80% o f Malawi’s exports, near-term growth will depend o n maintaining a
profitable tobacco sector which generates savings for investment in other activities. Contrary to popular
belief, world demand for tobacco i s s t i l l rising (at about 2% per annum) and Malawi, as an exporter o f
‘clean’ low-nicotine burley tobacco, i s relatively well-positioned in the international market. Tobacco
production has undergone deep structural change in the late 199Os, with smallholders n o w accounting for
70% o f a national crop that i s increasingly dominated by burley tobacco, while estates have become less
and less viable, unable t o compete with local smallholder production o f burley tobacco and intemational
production o f flue-cured tobacco following sharp reductions in world prices. As many as 40% o f estates
are believed to have left the sector in the last few years. For tobacco to continue t o grow, the three
institutional developments which supported smallholder burley production-farmers’ clubs, intermediate
buyers, and the increased availability o f credit-need to be reinforced and complemented with appropriate
advisory services aiming inter alia t o improve yields which, at less than 1,000 kglha, are h a l f the yields
achieved by Malawi’s competitors. The cost o f selling tobacco over the auction floors, n o w substantially
higher than in similar markets and already resulting in notable fee evasion, also needs to be reduced.
Stakeholders also need to give attention to Malawi’s other important crops-maize, the national staple,
as w e l l as tea, coffee, sugar, and cotton, the traditional cash crops. To increase maize yields, Malawian
farmers need to migrate to hybrid or open pollinated seed on a sustainable basis. At the same time, land
use needs to be rationalized, through the peaceful transferal o f underutilized estate and public land to landconstrained smallholders; and research and extension needs t o be dramatically improved (for example, by
decentralizing it, making it demand-driven, improving staff training and remuneration, and doubling
expenditure to bring i t back to levels seen in 1995 and 1996). The Government needs to improve the
ability o f the National F o o d Reserve Agency, working with A D M A R C , to manage Malawi’s strategic grain
reserve-without incurring unsustainable fiscal costs. M a l a w i also needs fully to exploit i t s potential for
diversifying into high-quality low-bulk export crops. Given i t s land-locked and land-constrained
circumstances, such exports provide the only way that M a l a w i can secure a remunerative long-term future
in agriculture.
Without macroeconomic stability, success in agriculture will remain elusive. In the last few years, high
inflation, combined with high Government domestic borrowing needed to finance fiscal deficits, has raised
interest rates and limited private-sector access to the credit markets. In 1998 and 2000, sharp currency
devaluations between fertilizer purchases and crop sales substantially raised input costs for farmers, while
in 2001, a currency appreciation during the tobacco growing and selling season exacerbated the effects o f
l o w auction prices. H i g h financing costs and the need t o hedge against exchange rate uncertainty also feeds
into high fertilizer costs (in 1999 M a l a w i wholesale prices were two to three times the prices prevailing in
Zambia and Zimbabwe), though high transaction costs, limited competition, and Government interference
in the market also contribute. W o r k also needs urgently to be undertaken to reduce transport costs, e.g.
through improving the Nacala corridor r a i l and port system. There i s clearly m u c h work that remains to be
done t o improve conditions for agricultural growth in Malawi.

Trade: Expansion in internal and extemal trade i s crucial for growth and poverty
reduction in M a l a w i . Over the past decade, Malawi’s trade performance has lagged
behind expectations. Malawi’s trade remains highly dependent o n a limited range o f
primary commodities, for several o f w h i c h the country has experienced a decline in i t s
international competitiveness and market share. Between 1990 and 2001, tobacco
accounted for the bulk o f the increment in Malawi’s export trade but even in that industry
there are serious challenges to sustained growth. Export product diversification has been
very limited and the country has only minimally taken advantage o f emerging market
opportunities within the region or beyond. Various structural changes-especially in the
tobacco sub-sector-provided for a broader distribution o f the benefits o f trade during the
early to mid-l990s, yet m a n y o f these gains have eroded in recent years due to the
declining profitability o f production. M a l a w i was also adversely affected by downward
movements in international commodity prices, and these trends were exacerbated by
supply side weaknesses w h i c h prevented or delayed an effective response in several
industries.

M a l a w i currently has an open trading environment with l o w tariffs and n o

Box 3: Sources o f Growth in M a l a w i
Despite many years o f reform, Malawi’s growth performance since the mid-1990s has been modest
and volatile, and has actually worsened in recent years. What can be done to accelerate growth?
T w o recent studies-the Bank’s recent Country Economic Memorandum and a Growth Strategy
Study carried out j o i n t l y by the Government’s Department o f Economic Planning and Development
(DEPD) and the National Action Group (NAG) attempt to provide some answers.
First, action will be required in four areas to create a pro-growth environment. In particular,
to achieve macroeconomic stability, characterized by l o w inflation and l o w real
M a l a w i needs: (i)
to reduce the risk facing
interest rates, and actively manage a rapidly-changing trade regime; (ii)
smallholder agriculture production, by establishing a reliable system for managing food emergencies,
implementing a program for enhancing agricultural productivity, and improving tobacco marketing
arrangements (Le. the supply chain); (iii)
to improve the highly-risky business environment facing
manufacturers, by improving the reliability o f infrastructure; making the tadincentive regime simple,
transparent, and less discretionary; and making the public and private institutions that support
businesses more responsive t o their clients; and (iv) to check the spread o f H I V I A I D S , which
significantly affects the growth potential o f the Malawian economy.
In addition, the Government study identifies a number o f specific sub-sector strategies
concerning product-specific researchiextension, support for formation o f smallholder cooperatives,
and support for marketing arrangements. Execution o f these strategies i s designed t o expand the
output and exports o f high-value crops such as tea, sugar, paprika, cotton, macadamia nuts and
pulses, and increased income f r o m expanded agricultural output could stimulate rural non farmenterprises. In parallel, an improved business environment could generate higher growth in smalland medium-scale manufacturing, exploiting Malawi’s long-run comparative advantage, as based on
l o w wages, increased availability o f agricultural commodities as inputs, and trade opportunities
generated by the increasingly open trading environment in the sub-region as w e l l as improved access
to markets in the U S and the EU under the AGOA and the EBA agreements. The most likely
industry to benefit i s textiles, although appropriate incentives, infrastructure and support institutions
could also lead to expanded output in the mining sector (particularly with respect to coal, gemstones,
bauxite and vermiculite).

growth and diversification have been: (i)
macroeconomic instability, and i t s effects on
the exchange rate and on the cost o f borrowing; (ii)
an emerging trend toward social
instability, with the spread o f H I V / A I D S and recurrent problems o f food insecurity; (iii)
the high costs o f transport; and (iv) supply-side issues within specific industries or subsectors which are retarding productivity and profitability. Other than measures to further
stabilize the macro-economy, in the short-term, those areas o f institutional strengthening
and p o l i c y reform w h i c h w o u l d likely have the greatest impact o n the country’s trade
(and related income benefits) l i e at the level o f particular industries o r sub-sectors.
14.
IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement:
Government performance in implementing i t s macroeconomic program supported by the
IMF has been less than satisfactory. The IMF approved i t s current three-year PRGF
arrangement in December 2000, but the first PRGF review, initially scheduled for June
2001, has not yet been completed. In a November 2002 mission, Fund staff found b o t h
that poverty-related expenditures were significantly below target and also that the fiscal
gap for 2002/03 w o u l d exceed the programmed level by almost 3.5% o f GDP. To
address this imbalance, the Government in December 2002 approved a package o f
remedial fiscal measures w h i c h w o u l d reduce the gap by about 1.5% o f GDP and the
program’s fiscal target was relaxed by 2%. Although poverty-related expenditures
subsequently reached projected levels, an additional fiscal gap opened, resulting m a i n l y
f r o m excessive recurrent expenditures in a few ministries. The overall fiscal deficit i s
now projected to reach about 9.5% o f GDP for 2002/03. The Government has proposed
additional measures to help restore the fiscal balance, but estimates indicate that even if
fully implemented these measures may not suffice to close the gap. Government
performance over the next few months i s expected to determine the outcome o f the
current PRGF arrangement w h i c h i s scheduled for completion in June.
Debt sustainability: At end-2002 Malawi’s external debt stock was $2.8 b i l l i o n
15.
o r 145% o f GDP. Nearly 93% o f this debt i s o n concessional terms, with about 81%
owed to multinationals ( o f which, 63% i s owed t o IDA). Total scheduled debt service in
2002 amounted to 18% o f goods and services ( o f which, 7% was owed to IDA), though
with relief granted so far, the actual debt service was 8%. M a l a w i reached the Decision
Point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in December 2000. At that time, the net present
value (NPV) o f debt-to-exports ratio with enhanced HIPC r e l i e f was expected to rise to
18 1% o f GDP in 2002 and fall below 150% o n l y in 2014; assuming further debt r e l i e f by
Paris Club members beyond the enhanced HIPC initiative, the NPV o f debt-to-exports
ratio could be below 150% starting in 2006 and average only 137% over the 2000-19
period.’ Total HIPC assistance was estimated at $643 m i l l i o n in NPV terms, or $ 1.O
b i l l i o n in nominal terms (of w h i c h IDA was expected t o contribute $588 m i l l i o n ). Since
the decision point, several multilateral and bilateral creditors have been providing interim
assistance”, but Malawi’s economy has performed at lower levels than projected, and as a
consequence the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio in 2002 (the anticipated completion point)
i s expected to be 161% rather than the 150% anticipated at the decision point. Assuming

Altogether, 92% o f Malawi’s bilateral creditors, including France, Germany, Japan and the UK, have
pledged to forgive a l l o f Malawi’s officially contracted debt at the HIPC completion point.

Political context

16.
President Muluzi's party, the United Democratic Front (UDF), continues to
control a parliamentary majority, holding 96 seats and enjoying the support o f four
independent MPs in the 194-seat National Assembly. The M a l a w i Congress Party (MCP,
the former ruling party) holds 65 seats in the current parliament and the Alliance for
Democracy (Aford) has 29. Party strength reflects regional ties, with UDF strong in the
populous south, MCP in the center, and A f o r d in the north. In early 2001, the MCP was
split into t w o factions, one headed by party president Gwanda Chakuamba and the other
by his former deputy John Tembo, but the t w o sides reconciled in January 2003. Brown
Mpinganjira, a former UDF minister, has formed the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA). Policy differences are small, with all parties committed in varying degrees to
pro-poor free-market policies. Local elections, the first in Malawi, were held on
November 21,2000, with the UDF winning a majority o f the seats on low voter turnout
o f about 15%.

Recently, there has been increasing attention to governance issues, including the
17.
general elections scheduled for 2004. Following three unsuccessful U D F - l e d attempts
(most recently in January 2003) to amend the constitution to allow President M u l u z i to
run for a third term, the President in M a r c h 2003 announced that h e will not stand as a
candidate for a third term, putting to rest a highly contentious issue that was distracting
many Government officials. iv (Subsequently, the UDF National Executive Committee
named Bingu w a Mutharika, former Deputy Govemor o f the Reserve B a n k and newlyappointed Minister o f Economic Planning and Development, as i t s Presidential candidate
and Cassim Chilumpha, a former Minister o f Education and o f Finance, as his running
mate for the 2004 elections; and the President appointed a n e w Cabinet w h i c h excluded
t w o senior UDF ministers from office.) Cumulative Government action over the last few
years has also given rise to concerns about Government commitment to the r u l e o f l a w
and the separation o f powers. M o r e than 100 changes have been made to the constitution
since 1994, often without consultation, and in late 2001, Parliament cut from 67% to 5 1%
the number o f votes needed to change the constitution and also passed a m o t i o n to
dismiss three judges for allegedly favoring the opposition (the cases were subsequently
referred to the Judiciary Services Committee and resolved). At the same time, the
prosecution o f several high-profile corruption cases (APEX, SECUCOM, the Petroleum
Control Commission cases) has stalled; senior MTL officials in mid-2001 were

implicated in corruption; and other senior Government officials in 2002 were implicated
in allegations, currently under investigation, that maize sales out o f the strategic grain
‘reserve were made in 2000/01 to politically-connected people at below-market prices.
Box 4: Malawi’s Framework for Addressing Corruption
The Corrupt Practices Act, passed by parliament in 1995, established broad definitions o f corrupt
practices, specified penalties, and created the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) with statutory authority to
conduct investigations. The A C B i s not part o f the M a l a w i Civil Service; i t s Director reports directly to
Parliament and these reports are subject to parliamentary enquiry. Since i t s inception the ACB has
followed a three-pronged strategy to address corruption. This involves: (i)
educating the public about
minimizing opportunities for corruption by revising laws and
Corruption and h o w to respond to it; (ii)
regulations that encourage it; and (iii)
initiating the investigation and prosecution o f a large number o f high
profile corruption cases. While the A C B has focused o n the right issues, i t faces serious capacity
constraints. I t has also had limited success in prosecuting high-profile corruption cases because o f illpreparedness o n i t s own part as well as capacity constraints in the judicial system and the office o f the
Department o f Public Prosecutions (DPP).
I t i s plain that the Government needs to strengthen the investigation and prosecution o f cases. This
requires focused attention at the highest political and bureaucratic levels; strengthening o f the existing legal
framework; and allocating additional resources to expand magistrate training, increase staffing levels at the
ACB, and establish specialized court proceedings for corruption cases. The Government recognizes these
challenges and has made some progress toward addressing them. A recent review o f the A C B A c t
recommended that the ACB be given the powers and mandate to prosecute corruption cases without having
to rely o n other agencies (as i t n o w relies o n the DPP).
M a l a w i also needs to eliminate opportunities for corruption, by reducing discretion and complexity and
improving transparency in laws governing the business environment, including tax incentives. In
particular, existing public procurement practices need to be restructured to ensure greater transparency and
accountability; and recent steps to clarify the roles and responsibilities o f ministers and principal secretaries
in financial decision-making and to strengthen oversight institutions (such as the Office o f the Ombudsman,
the National Assembly, and c i v i l society) need to be completed. Finally, implementation o f the MTEF,
expediting expenditure-control initiatives-such as the preparation o f new finance and audit laws, the
introduction of IFMIS, and regular publication o f actual expenditures against budgeted norms-would help
to create greater transparency about the u s e o f public money and reduce the potential for corruption.

18.

Government-donor relations: Typically, aid flows to M a l a w i amount to almost
12% o f GDP and finance about 40% o f total Government expenditures. As a result o f
weak implementation o f the Fund PRGF, failure by the Government to meet agreed
targets, and governance concerns focused particularly o n the third-term issue and political
commitment to the reform process, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United K i n g d o m
suspended balance o f payments support to M a l a w i f r o m December 2001 (Denmark
subsequently decided to end i t s program in Malawi). In a February 2003 review, local
representatives o f the four donors that have agreed to take a C o m m o n Approach to
Budget Support (the so-called CABS donors, w h i c h n o w include the European
Commission, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom) found that Malawi’s overall
poverty-reduction program remains high risk in terms o f impact and accountability; that
the Government had made some progress since the previous review (in September 2002);
and that they w o u l d recommend to their authorities releasing budget support totaling up
to $52 m i l l i o n from existing arrangements through 2003/04, if the first review o f the
Fund’s PRGF arrangement was completed and other bilateral conditions were met.

Donor disbursements for the past 18-to-24 months have continued to b e lower
than projected. Budget support has fallen sharply (IDA has n o t undertaken any
19.

-9-

adjustment lending since December 2000), though most donors, like IDA, have
compensated through increased project support and humanitarian assistance during the
2002 food crisis. Since the Government carries out expenditures in anticipation o f
extemal assistance, l o w donor disbursements have obliged the Government to borrow
fi-om the domestic market, putting pressure on interest rates and raising expectations o f
further inflation. In early 2003, the Government was planning to suspend the
implementation o f various domestically-financed development projects, and to limit
counterpart funding for foreign-financed projects that are not proceeding satisfactorily, to
maintain international reserves at 1.75 months o f imports. Although the Government’s
current macroeconomic targets remain attainable, continuing delays in donor
disbursements are calling into question the Government’s overall macroeconomic
strategy.

Performance under the previous CAS

The overall objective o f the 1998 C A S was far-reaching and sustained poverty
20.
reduction. The C A S (which was prepared w e l l before M a l a w i completed i t s first PRSP)
included four pillars:
Creating the conditions for broad-based, labor-intensive growth by promoting
smallholder agriculture and associated demand linkages to off-farm activities.
Bank support w o u l d facilitate private sector development through privatizing
selected state-owned enterprises, increasing competition in the financial sector,
promoting sound macroeconomic management, and enhancing private
participation in the power, roads, railways, and water sectors.
Fostering environmental sustainability and human development: B a n k
assistance w o u l d focus o n empowering communities to manage their natural
resources; developing S W A p s in health and education; and helping to devise a
social safety-net strategy emphasizing labor-intensive works programs.
Improvingpublic sector management and capacity: K e y B a n k action in this area
was to improve the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), introducing a
centralized revenue authority, strengthening c i v i l service reform, and building
capacity.
Strengthening policy dialogue, implementation and donor coordination: B a n k
assistance in this area w o u l d involve focusing on implementation and
strengthening collaboration among the external partners.

Performance under the 1998 C A S has been mixed. M o s t structural benchmarks
21.
were met, albeit with delay (see Annex B9), though a f e w k e y benchmarks, such as the
privatization o f MTL, have n o t been met. G r o w i n g political distractions, p o o r macroeconomic performance, weak implementation capacity, disagreement within M a l a w i on
some elements o f the reform program, and fatigue with the complex actions and delayed
response experienced in the overall reform process to date, have a l l impeded progress.

3.1

What Went Well

22.
M a n y k e y economic reforms have been completed since the mid-1990s. A
market-based exchange rate has been adopted and trade tariffs have been reduced f r o m a
m a x i m u m rate o f 35% t o 25% (among the lowest in the region). Malawi’s first full PRSP
was completed in April 2002; i t i s a high-quality document that explicitly protects
expenditures in pro-poor programs at appropriate levels. Allocations to health, education,
and community-based programs doubled f r o m 16% to 33% o f the budget between
1993/94 and 1999/2000, and selected sub-items within sectors (e.g. drugs, teaching
materials) are n o w being protected. Further w o r k has been done to integrate the mediumterm expenditure framework into the budget and to incorporate the findings o f a j o i n t
Government-Bank Public Expenditure Review (PER) completed in 2001. T o improve
,financial management, an integrated financial management information system (IFMIS)
i s being piloted in four ministries (with support f r o m IDA’SFinancial Management,
Accountability and Transparency project (FIMTAP)); and n e w units have been
established in the Ministry o f Finance to manage the aid budget and to monitor
parastatals and implement tighter financial controls. A more independent and
professional M a l a w i Revenue Authority has also been established and has contributed to
higher revenue collection.
23.
Structural reforms have been implemented in several areas, improving the
business environment. T o date, 58 units o f 50 companies have been commercialized o r
privatized, and there i s progress with many large privatizations (see summary in B o x 5,
page 12). M a j o r progress has occurred in banking (Stanbic acquired 60% o f the
Commercial B a n k o f M a l a w i in 2001), and in telecommunications (an independent
cellular telephone operator, Celtel Malawi, has entered the principal urban markets). In
the power sector, parliament has approved a n e w national energy p o l i c y (albeit after l o n g
delays); the $132 m i l l i o n 62 M w Kapichira hydroelectric power plant has been
completed, with IDA financing; the Electrical Supply Company (ESCOM), which has
been under the management o f Eskom South Africa since June 2001, i s being
restructured, and i s n o w realizing some efficiency gains; and w o r k i s underway, with
IDA support, to integrate the M a l a w i electricity grid with the southern A f r i c a power
market through an interconnection with the Mozambique grid. In the water sector, the
Government, over the last five years has devolved responsibility for rural water supply to
districts and communities, established three commercial Regional Water Boards to serve
towns, and shifted the focus o f the Ministry o f Water Development f r o m direct provision
o f water supply services in towns and villages towards water resource management. I t i s
also m o v i n g towards private sector participation in t o w n water supply by outsourcing the
operation o f individual water schemes to private operators, and in urban water supply by
introducing management/lease contracts in L i l o n g w e and Blantyre. The transport sector
has also seen significant progress since the last CAS. M a l a w i Railways was
concessioned to Central and East African Railways (CEAR)-a j o i n t venture held by the
Mozambican railway company, Caminhos de Ferro de Moqambique, and a United States
partner-and has been operational since late 1999; and in the road sector, road
management services have been conferred o n a commercially-oriented National Roads
Authority (NRA), and a Road Fund (financed by a fuel levy) has been established to fund
a comprehensive road maintenance program.

Box 5: Malawi’s Privatization Program
Parastatal reform continues to be an urgent need in Malawi. In the past two years, progress has been made
in several privatizations, sometimes with Bank assistance either through the Privatization and Utility
Reform project or through the macroeconomic dialogue and related technical assistance. A summary of the
current program status follows:
Stanbic South Africa acquired 60% o f the Commercial Bank of Malawi in Dec. 2001.
Malawi Lake Services management was transferred to Glens Waterways in February 2002, in a 20year concession.
The preferred bidder for Malawi Telecommunications Limited withdrew in late 2002, and the
Government decided to restart the process from the beginning. Seven expressions o f interest have been
received; announcement of a new preferred bidder i s expected in mid-2003.
Cabinet approval o f the power policy i s required for the Privatization Commission (PC) to hire
transaction advisers for Electricity Supply Company o f Malawi (ESCOM). I t i s expected that
independent generation will be permitted under the policy; distribution will be privatized through a 20-year
concession; and transmission will remain a Government monopoly.
Two bids have been received for Air Malawi and negotiations are expected in early 2003. Given
restrictions on the sale, the foreign bidder intends to bid only on a management contract.
The privatization o f the Malawi Development Corporation i s incomplete. Sunbird Tourism was
privatized through an initial public offering, but no progress has been made on MPICO.
Commercialization o f ADMARC’s markets has been delayed; i t has been determined that
ADMARC’s overheads are the cause o f continuing losses and that the markets themselves are profitable.
In 2001, MoFED assumed financial control o f ADMARC and recommitted to divesting various lossmaking subsidiaries. Current status i s as follows:
In May 2002, the Government directed that David Whitehead and Sons (DWS, a textile
company) should be privatized as a going concem. Some 1,700 staff were retrenched in October 2002
(about 200 remain). The preferred bidder, a consortium o f Mapeto Wholesalers and Jimtex (which has
long experience with textile manufacture including in Africa), has been announced. Proceeds o f the sale
will be used to pay secured creditors.
The privatization of Shire Bus Lines i s on hold. The company has restructured, i s focusing on its
profitable routes, and i s currently seeking to purchase new buses. The Government has stated that no
government guarantees will be offered for Shire Bus Line borrowings.
The Cold Storage Corporation has been divided into two units; the sale o f the Lilongwe unit i s
anticipated in early 2003; the Blantyre unit will be sold thereafter.
The information memorandum for the Grain Milling Corporation i s being distributed. Proceeds
o f the sale will be used to pay arrears and, if possible, retire secured debts.
ADMARC i s negotiating with an American investor, without the PC’s involvement (leading to
questions about the use o f proceeds), for the sale o f the Cotton Ginning Company.

24.

There have also been some successes in the agriculture sector. In 2001, the
Government abandoned the maize price band and agreed to shift the role o f the National
Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) away from direct market intervention to a purely r e l i e f
function (a measure supported by IDA’Smost recent adjustment operation, Fiscal
Restructuring and Deregulation Program 3 (FRDP3)). I t also reformed the Starter Pack
program, which provided small amounts o f free farm inputs to all 2.9 m i l l i o n farming
families, into a Targeted Input Program catering to the 1.5 m i l l i o n poorest households. In
addition, a National Safety N e t Strategy has been articulated through a collaborative
effort involving the Government, the Bank and other donors, and a Presidential
Commission has made recommendations for changes in land policy.

25.
Success has been less evident in the social sectors, though some progress has been
made. The Ministry o f Health and its partners continue to work towards operationalizing

- 12-

a sector-wide approach (SWAP): T o this end, an Essential Health Package has been
defined; a sector strategy has been completed; and the Ministry i s currently preparing a
three-year w o r k program, w h i c h some partners expect to begin financing f r o m a common
p o o l in July 2003. At the same time, the Ministry o f Education has established a good
Policy and Investment Framework (PIF), though m u c h w o r k needs to b e done to develop
the capacity for implementation.

26.

Finally, some progress has been made in improving governance. In particular,
Parliament has taken a more assertive oversight role; n e w high-quality finance and audit
bills have been prepared; the Government i s reinstating internal audit and has also agreed
to make the Auditor General independent; and the p i l o t phase o f the integrated financial
management information system (IFMIS) i s n o w underway (see also B o x 4).

3.2

What Went Less Well

27.
Economic indicators are s t i l l disappointing. Since 1995, the three k e y price
indicators-inflation,
interest rates, and the exchange rate-have a l l been high and
volatile, with volatility strongly correlated with changes in money supply. Fiscal
discipline remains elusive, as a result o f parastatal losses, unbudgeted spending o n
emergency relief, ineffective control mechanisms for regular spending, and inadequate
management o f aid flows. In recent years, the fiscal deficit after grants has been large,
with the F Y 0 3 deficit projected to be -9.5%. In light o f a continuing shortfall in foreign
financing, domestic Government borrowing i s expected to reach 7% o f GDP this fiscal
year, with the result that debt sustainability i s coming under question and high domestic
interest rates (currently at 50%) are l i k e l y to continue to constrain private investment
(only 4% o f GDP in FY02, compared with public investment o f 13% o f GDP).
28.
There have also been delays in structural reform. Monopolies o r oligopolies
continue to operate in m a n y large industries (sugar, cement, petroleum retailing, tobacco
auctioning, and transportation) and m a n y small- and medium-sized enterprises continue
to operate in protected environments w h i c h are not necessarily conducive to Malawi’s
long-term competitive advantage. Despite some progress o n privatization, many
productive and trading enterprises remain under public control-often at arms length
through ADMARC o r the M a l a w i Development Corporation (MDC). The National B a n k
o f M a l a w i (NBM) remains in Government hands; and cross-ownership and -directorships
o f financial institutions by conglomerates such as ADMARC and the Press Corporation
(which dominates m a n y sectors o f the economy) continue to confuse incentives. The
major water utilities are s t i l l experiencing financial difficulties because they cannot
collect dues f r o m government entities, undermining their ability to maintain o r expand
their physical assets and provide essential services, as w e l l as adding to the quasi-fiscal
deficit; at the same time political interference in utility operations prevents the Boards
f r o m operating as autonomous entities, impairing their ability to improve services; the
IDA-supported National Water Development project i s addressing these issues, but w i t h
m i x e d results. In the power sector, parliament has still not approved the power p o l i c y and,
despite the completion o f the Kapichira dam, access to electricity has hardly increased as
investment in transmission and distribution has lagged; moreover, despite some

export earnings and farm incomes; hence i t s marketing strategy and research and
extension efforts remain unfocused and ineffective. With respect to food security, the
responsibilities o f the National F o o d Reserve Agency (NFRA), ADMARC, the Ministry
o f Agriculture and Irrigation ( M o A I ) and the Ministry o f Finance (MoF) have not been
adequately delineated o r executed, with the result that manageable adverse developments
quickly evolve into crises, such as the February 2002 f o o d emergency. At the same time,
though progress i s expected in commercializing ADMARC and divesting i t s holding in
the National B a n k o f Malawi, i t s privatization continues to be delayed and to contribute
to the fiscal deficit. The PRSP recognizes that solving m a n y o f these problems requires

liberalization, privatization, and regulatory reform, but due to their complexity and the
limited public capacity to address them progress will remain slow.

In the social sectors, the situation i s poor. The health sector i s in a critical state,
30.
with inadequate drug supplies, low-quality services, and an acute shortage o f essential
health workers (with attrition, due mostly to emigration and H I V / A I D S , especially high
in the rural areas). Despite a longstanding recognition that reform o f the Central Medical
Stores i s essential (this was included as a H I P C completion point condition), progress has
been very slow. In the education sector, the quality o f education continues to deteriorate,
depleting further the capacity and productivity levels o n which government reforms and
development depend. In addition, the capacity o f the Ministry o f Education remains
weak, partly as a result o f frequent tumover in senior officials.
Further efforts are also needed in governance. Government ownership o f the
3 1.
procurement reform process i s weak; although a good draft reform bill has been approved
by Cabinet, i t has not been sent to parliament and needed reforms are not taking place.
Efforts to build capacity and strengthen institutions have not kept pace with demand;
expenditure controls and treasury operations remain weak; p a y reform i s progressing at a
very slow pace; and although a l l senior c i v i l servants are n o w o n contracts, these
contracts are not yet linked to performance. Legal and judicial reforms, including
especially those needed to combat corruption, are also overdue. (For a description o f
Bank-supported capacity-building efforts, see B o x 10).

Development Partnerships

The Bank’s partnership with the Government has deepened since the last CAS,
32.
and occasional p o l i c y disagreements have been managed in a frank and constructive
manner. The Government welcomed the Bank’s participation in the PRSP theme groups,
i t s consultations o n national capacity and o n the CAS, and i t s collaborative approach in
preparing b o t h the FYOl PER and the F Y 0 3 CEM. E v e n so, there continues to b e
significant differences between the B a n k and the Government concerning Malawi’s best
approach to outstanding problems in the agriculture sector, particularly regarding tobacco
marketing and the future o f ADMARC. As reported in the C A S Progress Report, the
FYOl Client Survey indicates that some client representatives find the B a n k to b e slow
and unresponsive, o r believe that B a n k staff apply preconceived solutions without due
attention to local conditions, o r attempt to impose solutions that are politically
insensitive, o r too demanding, o r otherwise inappropriate. There i s clearly a need for the
B a n k b o t h to communicate i t s poverty reduction mission better and to assess the l i k e l y
consequences o f recommended reforms more fully.
The B a n k works closely with the principal external partners in M a l a w i (see B o x
7). There exists a dedicated Aid Coordination Group, chaired by a l l donors on a rotating
basis, along with active sectoral groups in a l l o f the m a i n sectors. Efforts have been
made to move towards sector-wide approaches (S WAps) in education, health, agriculture,
33.

and local govemment/decentralization, although discussions o n sector strategies and
expenditure programs are proceeding very slowly. Since the 1998 C A S was prepared,
t w o Consultative Group (CG) meetings have been held, in December 1998 and M a y

2000, both in Lilongwe (at the more recent meeting, CG members pledged $1.1 billion o f
support to Malawi for 2000-01). The next CG meeting i s expected in late 2003.
Box 7: External Partner
M a l a w i i s heavily aid dependent. Extemal aid was equivalent to about 10% o f G D P in 2001102 (net
foreign borrowing was 3.2% and grants 6.8% o f GDP) and i s projected to be 15.7% o f G D P in 2002103 (net
foreign borrowing i s estimated to be 8.0% and grants 7.7% o f GDP). Aid financed about one-half o f the
overall budget in 2001102. Delays in donor disbursements can have, and have had, strong negative
repercussions on the country’s ability to meet i t s macroeconomic targets and implement its reform
program. This was particularly the case in 2002 when interest rates remained high (around 50%) owing to
increased levels o f Government borrowing, and the nominal exchange rate depreciated sharply following
non-disbursement o f donor inflows.
M a n y donors besides the Bank are active in Malawi. Four k e y donors (the European Union, Norway,
Sweden and the United Kingdom) are also taking a Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) by
pooling balance-of-payments resources. At present, the partnership has the following composition:

Japan has provided b o t h loan- and grant-based assistance to Malawi, with grant aid expected to
continue in the areas o f agriculture, water supply, communications, and the environment.
Germany provides support to agriculture (horticulture promotion and post-harvest loss prevention),

Lessons Learned for the Bunk

Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR): A CPPR was undertaken in
October 2002. I t identified four clusters o f issues affecting portfolio performance:

- 16-

0

0

Project management problems persist, despite strengthening technical support
from the Bank’s Country Office. These problems appear to result f r o m (i)
poor
project design; (ii)
complex implementation arrangements; (iii)
delays in
employing k e y project staff; (iv) non-uniformity in project staff employment
conditions; and (v) lack o f ownership by b o t h Government and project staff.
Problems with project financial management also remain, despite improvements
such as more timely submissions o f monthly expenditure returns to Treasury and
a reduction in the withdrawal-application rejection rate. In particular, counterpart
funds continue to be inadequate or disbursed late, and Special Accounts (SAs)
remain difficult to manage (due to a lack o f uniformity in taxation treatment and
delayed reception o f bank statements needed to request S A replenishment).
Procurement management remains weak, especially due to misprocurement and
delays in the execution o f procurement functions (due to the poor quality o f
procurement staff and delays in procurement evaluation procedures, resulting
f r o m a need to f o l l o w parallel Government and B a n k procurement procedures).
There are also weaknesses in monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Despite
recognition o f the need to monitor and evaluate implementation progress t o assess
value-added, M&E activities continue to b e undertaken in a fragmented manner
and quantitative progress assessment by line ministries i s inadequate.

In keeping with these findings, the 2000 C A S Progress Report found that, in
retrospect, the program articulated in the 1998 C A S was too ambitious-in terms o f the
scope o f reforms proposed, the Government’s capacity to deliver them, and the degree o f
dialogue needed within M a l a w i to ensure ownership, particularly when some elements o f
the reform program (that is, those related to withdrawal o f the state f r o m sensitive areas
such as food and agricultural marketing and core utility and infrastructure services) are
s t i l l not widely agreed. Government concerns about the slow output and employment
response to previous reforms have made agreement even more difficult to obtain. Too
often, the result has been weakly o r incompletely implemented reforms that, by confusing
incentive structures, have disrupted previous mechanisms for achieving specified
outcomes without establishing stronger mechanisms in their place.

35.

A number o f specific lessons emerge for the B a n k in formulating the next phase
36.
o f i t s assistance strategy:

e

The B a n k needs to be more strategic and selective. Efforts over the last five years
were spread over a large range o f sectors and issues, tying up scarce Government
capacity and failing to achieve a transformative impact in any particular sector. In
some cases, such as agricultural marketing, lack o f demonstrable success,
including a slow supply response f r o m the private sector, exhausted tolerance for
further reform.
Within i t s areas o f concentration, the Bank’s aims need to b e more modest,
supporting reforms w h i c h are high priority, owned by the Government, and within
the Government’s delivery capacity.

3.5

The Bank needs to do more to ensure ownership o f reforms before proceeding,
and this requires a better understanding o f what i s involved in ownership and o f
h o w to judge when i t i s present.
High-quality project preparation i s essential to effective program delivery. T o
ensure success, there i s a need to refocus o n basic elements, including (i)
the
design o f the core management system (Le. financial management, procurement,
M&E, and capacity building); (ii)
the recruitment o f a competent core
management team (manager, financial manager, procurement specialist, and
M&E officer) prior to effectiveness; and (iii)
the definition o f clear roles and
close working and reporting relationships between the development program
management team and the line ministry management team.
Current Status of the Bank Program

As o f M a y 2003, the Bank’s portfolio covered seven sectors and consisted in
37.
eleven projects totaling $359 m i l l i o n in commitments ($166 m i l l i o n undisbursed) (see
Table 1 and Annex BS). The 1998 C A S overestimated capacity and willingness to
implement the reform program, with the result that the program was o n l y partially
completed, and with long delays. T o date,

sustained. As a consequence o f continuing capacity constraints and implementation
bottlenecks, 22% o f current commitments involve problem projects. In addition, OED
reports that M a l a w i performance data f r o m FY96 through FY02 indicate very poor
results, with less than six in ten projects rated satisfactory and less than one in ten
achieving substantial institutional development. Overall performance has been poor and,
given this performance, business-as-usual i s not an option.
Box 8: Malawi’s Performance against the Base Case Indicators
Malawi’s progress against the base case indicators o f the August 1998 C A S has been mixed. In
retrospect, the C A S program was too ambitious regarding the scope o f the reform agenda, the degree o f
Government ownership, and Government capacity to implement. Support was particularly weak for
reforms related to withdrawal o f the state f r o m sensitive areas such as food and agricultural marketing and
core utility and infrastructure services. Progress against the key indicators has been as follows:
Progress o n improving theafiscal and monetary framework has been mixed. T a r i f f and surtax
reforms have been implemented, and annual inflation has declined f r o m 22% at end-2001 to about 7.5% at
end-2003. The deficit remains a concern.
The MTEF has been implemented and more than 20 spending items are protected, including in the
social sectors. At end-2002, revenue overperformance and compressed domestically-financed development
spending enabled overall pro-poor spending programs to remain in l i n e with projections.
Civil service reforms are incomplete. The number o f ministries has been reduced, some Government
services have been contracted out, and senior c i v i l servants are being placed o n contracts, but staff
rationalization and salary compression remain issues.
Stanbic South Africa acquired 60% o f CBM in December 2001. The Government has stated an
intention to commercialize ADMARC and i s making progress in divesting i t s non-core assets, but plans to
sell NBM and the mature holdings o f MDC are delayed.
Following withdrawal o f the previous winning bidder, M a l a w i Telecoms i s being prepared for a new
tender; regulatory reforms have laid the base for more commercial and competitive power and water
sectors, but E S C O M and the water boards are s t i l l not o n a viable footing.
Agricultural reforms have been modest. The maize price band was eliminated in 2000. In addition,
the starter pack has been scaled back and targeted o n poorer households; this was expected t o reduce i t s
coverage f r o m 2.9 m i l l i o n to 1.5 m i l l i o n households and i t s costs f r o m about $25 m i l l i o n t o about $12
million, but the Government i s reconsidering this matter in light o f the 2002 food emergency.

Portfolio performance improved significantly in FYOO-0 1 but deteriorated thereafter.

IFC’s portfolio in M a l a w i i s small, totaling $3.0 m i l l i o n in six projects w h i c h are

the privatization o f Malawi’s largest insurer (through a management buyout) and
financing for a small business hotel. T w o additional projects in the financial sector are

The New Country Assistance Strategy

Malawi faces a number o f formidable challenges, which the Government has
40.
addressed in its first full PRSP, completed in April 2002. The poverty strategy as set out
in the Government’s PRSP has four pillars:
0

0

0

0

Promoting economic growth and structural transformation: Pro-poor growth
will be achieved by developing a good investment climate and by promoting
particular sectors o f the economy. According to the PRSP, the investment climate
will be improved by attaining macroeconomic stability (where this implies
improving public expenditure management, controlling money supply, and
maintaining a stable and competitive exchange rate) and by improving basic
infrastructure (including especially rural roads, power, and telecommunication
services). The PRSP also argues that growth and poverty reduction in Malawi
depend critically on promoting agriculture, with a focus on small-scale irrigation,
improved extension services, and better access to credit and agricultural inputs.
This CAS will support this PRSP pillar through advisory activities (including a
CPAR, a Public Expenditure Review (PER), a Financial Sector Review, and an
Institutional Governance Review) focusing on improving public expenditure
management and achieving macroeconomic stability as well as new lending for a
Community Land Reform and an IntegratedRural Income Generationproject.
Enhancing human development: Under the PRSP, human capacity will be
expanded by providing education and training, promoting good nutrition, and
delivering an Essential Healthcare Package (EHP). In education, the focus will be
on improying access, quality, and equity by implementing detailed strategies
formulated within the joint donor-GovernmentPolicy and Investment Framework
(PIF). In health, the EHP will address principally the needs o f the rural poor by
focusing resources on preventative and primary health care, decentralizing
responsibilities, and improving access to medical personnel in rural areas. The
PRSP’s nutrition strategy will focus on community-based nutrition interventions
along with dietary-changecampaigns. The CAS will support this pillar through
the country status reports for health and education and new financing for a Health
project and an Education project.
Protecting the most vulnerable: Under the PRSP, this will be achieved by
providing the chronically poor and transient poor with adequate safety-nets,
including (i)
a Targeted Input Program (TIP) providing seed and fertilizer to poor
farmers; (ii) a public works program; (iii) targeted nutrition programs; and (iv)
direct welfare transfers to the poor who cannot benefit from one o f the first three
programs. IDA’SHIVIAIDS project and the MASAF3 project (presented to the
Board together with this CAS), as well as a gender assessment (underway), will
support this PRSP pillar. IDA will also complete a Poverty Assessment during
the CAS period (thereby ensuring that all due-diligence economic and sector work
remains up-to-date).
Promoting good governance: According to the PRSP, this will involve
institution-building (strengthening the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), improving
coordination between the various oversight agencies, and establishing a new

- 20 -

Procurement Authority); reforming incentives and w o r k ethics within the public
service (e.g. through developing and implementing a medium-term wage policy);
and implementing the DFID-sponsored M a l a w i Safety, Security and Access to
Justice program (MASSAJ), whose m a i n objectives are to reduce crime, improve
access to effective justice for the poor and ensure respect for the rule o f law. The
C A S will support this pillar through AAA, including the CPAR, the Institutional
Governance Review, and continuing IDF-funded support to the ACB.
Box 9 : Assessment of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
A joint W o r l d Bank-IMF Staff Assessment (JSA) o f the PRSP was presented to the Board in August
2002. The JSA and the Board b o t h concluded that the PRSP constitutes a credible poverty reduction
strategy for M a l a w i and a sound basis for IDA and IMF concessional assistance.
The JSA found the PRSP’s m a i n strengths to be: (i)
a highly participatory process; (ii)
an
a balanced approach to public policy;
appropriate macroeconomic framework and financing plan, (iii)
and (iv) a well-articulated action plan and well-designed institutional structure for monitoring results.
I t also found that successful implementation o f the PRSP would be challenging and would require
further work in several areas. First and foremost, it noted an urgent need for M a l a w i to address its
debilitating capacity constraints. While the PRSP acknowledges these problems, i t does n o t recognize
the need to address them in a comprehensive manner and it does not suggest h o w this might be done.
(To this end, at the request o f the Government, the Bank in 2003 completed a national capacity
assessment in partnership with other key donors, and i t i s n o w helping the Government to prepare a
National Capacity Building Program.) The JSA also points to the critical importance o f public
expenditure management to maximizing Malawi’s potential for economic growth and development, and
the consequent need to make difficult choices, given scarce resources and many competing demands.
In addition, the JSA calls for a more all-encompassing view o f trade, which should be more clearly
integrated into the four pillars o f the PRSP, and suggests the need for a better understanding o f the
linkages between the PRSP’s medium-term measures and long-term growth.
The challenges to improving and implementing Malawi’s PRSP, although considerable, are not
insurmountable, if three conditions are met. First, putting the plan into action must receive the
undivided attention o f the country’s political leadership. Second, close attention must be paid to
managing and monitoring expenditures. Third and last, the country’s development partners must work
together to allocate resources carefully and in a coordinated manner, taking advantage o f the
comparative advantage of each actor. With due attention to these matters, M a l a w i can make good
progress in implementing i t s PRSP and reducing poverty.

4.1

Strategic Issues for this CAS

The B a n k Group’s activities in M a l a w i involve a focused set o f programs
41.
supported through p o l i c y dialogue founded o n sound analytical w o r k and a welldeveloped Government-donor partnership. Given Malawi’s development priorities as set
out in the PRSP, the central strategic issues f o r the IDA lending program concern the
level, type and sectoral composition o f i t s support. K e y variables considered in
determining the appropriate composition include: the importance o f the activity to
Malawi’s development; Government ownership, capacity and commitment to act; as w e l l
as the Bank’s o w n track record and comparative advantage vis-a-vis Malawi’s other
development partners. With more than a dozen major partners active in Malawi, each
historically pursuing individual programs that impose a significant burden o n Malawi’s
limited capacity, a concerted effort i s underway among the principal partners to
coordinate more effectively n o t o n l y in program implementation but also in the division
o f labor. The Bank i s w o r k i n g particularly closely with the United K i n g d o m and the

-21 -

European U n i o n (which together with the Bank account for about one-third o f external
support to Malawi) as w e l l as the United States, the Nordic donors, and the UN family.
Extensive consultations were also held concerning the preparation o f this CAS. This has
resulted in a fourfold strategic shift in the Bank’s strategy:
0

0

0

0

4.2

In light o f Malawi’s slippage into the l o w case, the strategy focuses o n a number
o f core reforms that are critical to achieving macroeconomic stability, improving
public expenditure management, and establishing a basis for sustainable povertyreducing growth. Decisive progress in these areas will also help M a l a w i to reattain the base case.
The n e w strategy aims to support critical human development interventions that
can achieve results o n the ground even in a l o w case environment. If M a l a w i
attains the base case, the financing program will be expanded, with resources
concentrated in a f e w k e y sectors to ensure that assistance to these sectors has a
transformational effect.
The strategy emphasizes interventions w h i c h will lead to poverty reduction in the
medium- and long-term (e.g. creating a good investment climate) rather than
interventions w h i c h have short-term, but possibly unsustainable, poverty-reducing
effects (safety nets).
With a v i e w to improving donor coordination and m i n i m i z i n g the donor draw o n
Malawi’s limited capacity, the strategy aims explicitly to increase the volume o f
jointly-completed AAA (e.g. the recent CFAA); to exploit common funding
mechanisms whenever feasible; to initiate an operational shift away f r o m projectbased lending to a more programmatic approach by supporting SWAPS,
particularly in H I V / A I D S , health and education, provided that public expenditure
management i s satisfactory; and finally to establish common donor priorities
concerning p o l i c y and institutional reform, as reflected in the IMF’s PRGF
arrangement, the C A B S agreements, and the Bank’s adjustment operations.

The Base Case Scenario and Lending Program

42.

Accelerating poverty-reducing growth in M a l a w i requires p o l i c y and institutional
reform in several k e y areas, aiming to reduce risks across a l l sectors o f the economy; to
improve household food security and smallholder productivity; to improve Malawi’s

check the spread o f H I V / A I D S . To reduce the percentage o f Malawians living in poverty
f r o m 65% today to 38% in 2015 w o u l d require growth o f over 6.0% per annum over the
medium term. Sustaining growth at this level will b e difficult, particularly with Malawi’s
high H I V / A I D S prevalence rate (which, by depleting human resources in a l l sectors o f
the economy, i s estimated to reduce growth per annum by 1.O% to 1.5 percent), but i t i s
possible if the Government completes a set of k e y core reforms in a t i m e l y manner.

43.
M o r e specifically, M a l a w i could attain accelerated poverty-reducing growth over
the medium term if the Government:

Achieves macroeconomic stability (Le. l o w inflation, l o w real interest rates, and
l o w exchange-rate volatility);
Creates a reliable food security system;
Improves maize and fertilizer markets;
Eliminates bottlenecks in the tobacco supply chain;
Improves land management;
Improves transportation through the Nacala corridor and invests in rural roads;
Increases the reliability o f electricity supply;
Creates simple, predictable, transparent tax and incentive structures; and
Effectively addresses concems about corruption and weak governance, including
poor implementation o f donor-supported development programs.

In the base case, the Government w o u l d make steady progress towards achieving
44.
macroeconomic stability and also begin to undertake the reforms required to improve
service delivery and build a platform for sustained poverty-reducing growth. In
particular, improved public expenditure management w o u l d result in lowering borrowing,
lower inflation, and lower real interest rates; the national H I V / A I D S program w o u l d
begin to control the spread o f H I V / A I D S , particularly among health and education
workers; land management w o u l d be improved; Govemment interference in the maize
and fertilizer markets w o u l d be reduced, resulting in greater market efficiency;
bottlenecks in the tobacco supply chain w o u l d be reduced; transportation l i n k s w o u l d be
strengthened, particularly in the rural areas and including the Nacala railway corridor;
and tax and incentive structures w o u l d b e made simpler, more predictable, and more
transparent. The Govemment w o u l d also effectively address concems about corruption
and weak governance, including poor implementation o f donor-supported development
programs. Under these circumstances, growth could improve to 3.0% o r 5.0% per
annum, in the near-term, and 6.0% and beyond in the medium term, thus reaching levels
that w o u l d reduce poverty. If M a l a w i meets the base case triggers, lending could rise to
$215 m i l l i o n over the C A S period and could include adjustment lending.

Assuming steady progress in the base case, the Bank’s overall strategy for M a l a w i

w o u l d a i m to help the Government to transition f r o m implementing a relatively reactive
and disjointed development program that overstretches i t s capacity, to implementing a
more proactive, focused, and integrated program that addresses the k e y constraints to
growth and poverty reduction. This implies a sequence o f activities and outcomes to be
achieved over time, with F Y 0 4 focusing on: (i)
undertaking k e y accountability activities
(including completion o f a CPAR, effective implementation o f the initial stages o f
FIMTAP, and initiation o f k e y monitoring and evaluation w o r k with the support o f an
IDF grant); (ii)
agreeing with the Government and i t s k e y extemal partners o n public
expenditures related to human development (through completion o f the F Y 0 3 CEM and
initiation o f the health and education country status reports); (iii)
initiating k e y IDAsupported safety-net activities (including the ongoing EDFW and the n e w M A S A F 3 and
an H I V / A I D S projects); and (iv) piloting efforts t o redistribute underutilized land t o the
poor through a proposed Community L a n d project. This w o u l d lead to higher levels o f
Government ownership in late F Y 0 4 o r early F Y 0 5 o f the k e y reforms that are needed to
enhance accountability and achieve poverty-reducing growth. In FY05, following the

complete an Institutional Governance Review; (ii)
prepare a n e w Health project; and (iii)
identify and support the implementation o f k e y measures for achieving sustainable broadbased growth in rural areas, with an emphasis o n agricultural p o l i c y and basic rural
infrastructure (telecommunications, power, and water). In FY06, the program will (i)
complete a n e w PER and (ii)
prepare a n e w Education project. If the Government agrees
to implement required structural reforms, these actions will also b e supported in the base
case through adjustment lending.
Grant resources made available under the I D A 1 3 framework for the C A S period

will depend o n Malawi’s IDA allocation (Malawi i s a debt-vulnerable country). These
resources will b e allocated to the Health and Education projects, as these projects are
expected to have a strong human-development impact.
The lending program will be supported by analytical w o r k and a proactive policy
dialogue that focuses o n the core issues listed in paragraph 43 above. A CPAR, Poverty
Assessment, and Public Expenditure Review (PER) will be completed over the C A S
period to ensure that due-diligence economic and sector w o r k remains current. The
strategy also aims to improve donor coordination and re-build confidence and credibility
within the development partnership for Malawi, and to this end, the B a n k will continue to
w o r k closely with the Government and the IMF to ensure that the poverty reduction
program supported by the Fund i s implemented. The financing and AAA program for
FY04-06 for the base case are summarized in the Table 2 below.

macroeconomic stability @.e.l o w inflation, l o w real interest rates, and l o w exchange-rate
volatility). There i s widespread agreement among Malawi’s partners that progress under
this pillar i s critical to Malawi’s development, and IDA i s coordinating closely with key
donors in this area, including especially DFID, the EU and the UN. A key component o f
IDA’s strategy under this pillar i s diligent implementation o f FIMTAP ($23.7 million,
presented to the Board in M a r c h 2003), which aims to improve financial management by
mainstreaming a computerized integrated financial management information system
(IFMIS); strengthening accountability institutions; and building capacity in the critically
important areas o f financial management, auditing, accounting, and information
technology. In addition, IDA’s ongoing Privatization and Utility Reform i s helping the
Government to reduce i t s presence in institutions that should b e privately held (see B o x 5
for a status report) and to give remaining government-owned institutions a commercial
orientation, w h i l e the National Water Development project, the Road Maintenance
project, and the Secondary Education project are supporting efficiency-enhancing
reforms in the k e y institutions in the relevant sectors.

49.
N e w lending under this pillar w o u l d include a Learning and Innovation L o a n
(LIL, $5 million) supporting the development o f a Global Development Learning
N e t w o r k (GDLN), w h i c h will help to strengthen learning related to macroeconomic
management. The M a l a w i GDLN w o u l d include a m a i n distance learning center (DLC)
in L i l o n g w e and an associated facility in Blantyre, and each center w o u l d include satellite
links, global video-conferencing abilities, and training facilities. The centers w o u l d be
linked to a global network o f GDLN sites, including ten in Africa. The D L C s w o u l d

provide direct access to global knowledge for public- and private-sector capacity-

building, training, and interactivity, thereby increasing the efficiency o f capacity-building
activities and lowering the costs o f these activities for Malawi.

Box 10: Capacity-building Interventions Supported by the World Bank
The W o r l d Bank will support significant capacity building under FIMTAP (approved in M a r c h
2003). Building o n lessons o f the second Institutional Development project, F I M T A P includes a
“capacity-building facility” which will be demand-driven and will attempt t o improve training
capacity in Malawi. All Ministries will participate in the facility, which will support capacitybuilding in key expenditure-accountability areas such as accounting, auditing, information
technology, records management, financial management, procurement and project management.
Malawi’s needs in this area are very large (for example, it i s estimated that 200 intemal auditors
need to be trained in order to support reasonable internal audit standards). F I M T A P will also
support capacity-building activities focused o n monitoring and evaluation, facilities management
(for the integrated financial management information system (IFMIS), institutional development
(for procurement, intemal audit, and the National Accounts Office), the Public Accounts
Committee, and project supervision.
In addition to i t s capacity-building work in F I M T A P , the Bank supports sectoral capacitybuilding through many sector projects as w e l l as the technical assistance project associated with the
third Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation operation (FRDP 3 TA) and an IDF grant supporting
the Anti-Cormption Bureau (ACB). FRDP 3 TA has helped the Government to draft the new
Finance Bill, Audit Bill and Procurement Bill, while the IDF grant has supported direct training
and study tour opportunities for nearly a l l A C B staff members. In addition, a large capacitybuilding consultancy for procurement management i s currently under negotiation.

50.
In addition, lending under this pillar in the base case w o u l d include t w o
Structural Adjustment Credits (SACS) w h i c h will support k e y structural reforms
complementing the Government’s macroeconomic stabilization efforts, with a v i e w to
establishing a foundation for broad-based sustainable growth. The measures that w o u l d
b e supported by the SAC(s) w o u l d fall into three categories: (i)
improving expenditure
advancing parastatal
management (including progress o n fiscal decentralization); (ii)
reform (which i s expected to include privatization o f some o f MTL, MDC, Air Malawi,
and the power and water sectors; the divestiture o f ADMARC’s non-core subsidiaries;
and greater transparency in ADMARC’s maize marketing operations); and (iii)
implementing k e y p o l i c y and institutional reforms in the agriculture sector (which i s
expected to include the devolution o f selected agricultural services to the district
assemblies and improved efficiency in tobacco marketing arrangements). Conditionality
w o u l d b e closely coordinated with the Fund and the CABS donors.

AAA under this first C A S pillar will build o n a recently-completed CEM focusing
5 1.
o n Malawi’s prospects for growth and poverty reduction and the core reforms that need to
b e completed to accelerate growth. M o r e specifically, the C E M examined factors that
affect growth in all sectors (such as macroeconomic volatility, transportation services, the
trading environment, and govemance) as w e l l as factors that affect in particular
agricultural productivity (especially in maize and tobacco) and the business environment
for manufacturers. M a n y o f the recommendations emerging f r o m this CEM have
informed the strategy presented in this C A S and the policy content o f proposed
investment operations, including especially in agriculture. IDA completed a CFAA in
F Y 0 3 and i s n o w completing a CPAR, w h i c h will j o i n t l y make recommendations to b e
supported through AAA, and i t i s continuing to w o r k w i t h the Government t o implement
k e y recommendations o f the FYOl PER. A successor PER, projected for FY05, i s l i k e l y
to focus o n the management o f contingent liabilities, the medium-term wage policy, and
Malawi’s public sector capacity. Moreover, the ongoing FRDP3 Technical Assistance
project has been helping the Government to r e f o r m i t s k e y finance and audit laws as w e l l
as i t s public procurement l a w and practices. Finally, if the Government considers i t to b e
desirable, the Bank will help i t to obtain IDF resources to build capacity for results-based
monitoring and evaluation.
4.2.2 Pillar 11: Establishing a platform for long-term sustainable growth
To reduce poverty, future growth in M a l a w i needs to be rapid (nearly 6% per
52.
annum), broad-based, and sustainable. K e y actions that are needed to achieve such
growth include: improving land management; improving agricultural markets
(particularly in maize and fertilizer); eliminating bottlenecks in the tobacco supply chain;
improving critical infrastructure (including in particular transportation and electricity
supply); and establishing simple, predictable, transparent tax and incentive structures. A
number o f IDA’S ongoing projects are addressing some o f these issues: the National
Water Development project i s helping to improve and expand urban water supplies,
w h i c h are critical to business needs; the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation project has
established a road authority and i s leading to improved maintenance; and the Regional
Trade project has created a facility that can insure investors against political risks. E v e n
so, there are several gaps, w h i c h IDA intends t o address in cooperation with other donors.

- 26 -

53.
In particular, to help M a l a w i achieve greater food security and lift some o f the
rural population out o f poverty, IDA recognizes an urgent need for the Government to
promote rural development, including in particular in agriculture. Past IDA efforts to
assist the agriculture sector have met with limited success and agreement between IDA
and the Government o n future reform remains elusive.“ In IDA’Sview, a successful
project w o u l d need to focus on: (i)
completing overdue reforms in the tobacco sector,
including reducing levies, permitting contract farming, and liberalizing the intermediate
buyers scheme in a controlled manner; (ii)
decentralizing the Ministry o f Agriculture,
w h i c h w o u l d include devolving k e y front-line services to local governments; and (iii)
improving basic rural infrastructure in the water, power and transport sectors. M o s t o f
Malawi’s external partners share the Bank’s approach to these issues, though there are
stakeholders w h o believe that past reforms have been misguided and who continue to
prefer heavy government intervention in the sector. Nonetheless, given the sector’s
importance t o growth and poverty-reduction, IDA intends to continue to seek common
ground with the Government and to develop an appropriate project for IDA financing. In
the base case, IDA could support this initiative with t w o free-standing projects, one in
Agriculture ($30 million) and another in rural Infrastructure Services ($40 million).

IDA will also seek to help establish a growth platform by supporting a
54.
Community Land Reform project ($25 million) that will build o n the Government’s
new land p o l i c y and p i l o t reforms intended to provide securer forms o f tenure and more
equitable community-based distribution o f underutilized land to Malawi’s poorest
agriculture-dependent households. In particular, the project will seek, o n a p i l o t basis, to
increase the incomes o f between 15,000 and 20,000 poor rural families by implementing
a community-based approach to land acquisition and complementary community
investment subprojects. I t will also support the Government’s efforts to strengthen the
institutional capacity for land tenure regularization and land administration, particularly
at the district level. By helping t o establish an efficient land market that allocates land to
i t s most efficient user, b o t h growth and equity will be promoted, as smallholders are
typically the most efficient agricultural producers.
M a l a w i i s also one o f five countries participating in the Southern Africa Power
55.
Market project, w h i c h IDA i s expected to support with credits totaling $175 million.
The overall objective o f this project i s to facilitate development o f an efficient regional
power market that will reduce electricity prices in the Southem African Development
Community (SADC) countries, foster regional integration, increase competitiveness, and
create the conditions for accelerated investment. The M a l a w i component, w h i c h IDA i s
financing with a credit o f up to $43 m i l l i o n (depending o n cofinancing), will support the
construction o f a 220kV transmission line f r o m Matambo in Mozambique to the border

” The last two projects in the sector closed in FYOO with unsatisfactory ratings.

A M a y 1998 OED overview found that only 8 o f 17 IDA agriculture projects, or 47%, were satisfactory at closure (three o f four
agriculture adjustment operations were satisfactory). Failure pre- 1994 resulted partly f r o m the Bank’s
uncritical acceptance o f the estate/smallholder division; partly f r o m a lack o f linkages between extensionand incentives-oriented efforts; and partly f r o m an overemphasis o n maize productivity. OED recommended supporting diversification in smallholder development; providing pluralistic extension support;
broadening the rural development strategy (e.g. to include rural infrastmcture); and increasing attention to
the regional aspects o f agricultural development and trade.

with M a l a w i (1 3 1 km) as w e l l a n e w substation at Phombeya, thereby integrating the
M a l a w i electricity grid with the southem A f r i c a power p o o l and so lessening i t s
dependence on hydroelectric power generated f r o m erratic and heavily-silted water f l o w
o n the Shire River. This project should help to make the provision o f electrical power to
M a l a w i a n businesses more efficient and less expensive, thereby helping to improve the
overall business environment.
Analytical w o r k already described under the first pillar, including the CPAR and
56.
the CFAA, will also support this second pillar. In addition, IDA'Scontribution to the
dialogue in the agriculture sector will draw heavily o n ongoing analytical w o r k under this
second pillar, including a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) o f ADMARC's
rural markets, the first full CEM since 1998, and a comprehensive review o f the tobacco
sector completed in April 2003. An Institutional Governance Review will help to
pinpoint government practices w h i c h have an impact o n the business environment in
M a l a w i and identify areas for improvement; and a Financial Sector Review will help to
identify weaknesses in that sector as well as opportunities for increasing banking
efficiencies and expanding access to credit. IDA will also continue to promote good
govemance by supporting the w o r k o f the Anti-Corruption Bureau (through an existing
IDF grant), procurement reform (through the ongoing FRDP 3 Technical Assistance
project, a small credit o f $3 million), and the components o f FIMTAP supporting selected
compliance and oversight institutions

4.2.3

Pillar 111: Improving service delivery and expanding the safety net

57.
T w o critical outcomes that M a l a w i should seek t o achieve in the near-term are
controlling the spread o f H I V / A I D S and creating a reliable food security system. The
2002 food emergency, w h i c h ineffective Govemment p o l i c y and p o l i c y execution
exacerbated, has made the need for a more reliable food security system evident: a k e y
Bank-supported intervention under this pillar i s the Emergency Drought Recovery
Project, w h i c h the Board approved in November 2002, and sound implementation will b e
a major IDA focus. I t i s also clear that AIDS-related mortality i s devastating Malawi,
with AIDS-related deaths reversing hard-won gains in l i f e expectancy and child
mortality, creating unprecedented numbers o f orphans, and depleting the ranks o f
teachers, doctors and nurses more rapidly than they can b e filled. To help address this
critical problem, IDA i s preparing an H I V / A I D S project ($35 m i l l i o n grant) under the
framework o f the Multicountry A I D S Program. IDA assistance aims: (i) t o help shift the
modality o f H I V / A I D S interventions f r o m multiple discrete HIV-related programs to a
S W A P funded f r o m a common pool; (ii)
to ensure that available resources are channeled
to experienced front-line implementing agencies as rapidly and securely as possible
(substantial resources f r o m IDA, DFID and the Global Fund for AIDS, Malaria and
Tuberculosis are n o w beginning to flow"'); and (iii)
to monitor and evaluate a l l funded
H I V / A I D S interventions to assess effectiveness, promote learning, and generate greater
efficiencies in future activities. IDA i s n o w w o r k i n g with the National A I D S
Commission (NAC), w h i c h i s charged with coordinating the national response to

implementing agencies, and monitoring the impact o f HIV/AIDS-related programs, to
ensure rapid and effective implementation o f Malawi’s national program.
In addition, IDA has prepared a third credit in support o f the M a l a w i Social
58.
A c t i o n Fund ( M A S A F 3), w h i c h makes funding available t o communities for
community-identified sub-projects in health, education, water and sanitation, local roads,
and the environment. This credit, w h i c h i s being presented to the B o a r d together with
this CAS, will a i m to empower communities to manage their prioritized sub-projects
within a Development Planning Framework, approved by the District Assemblies, for
improving access t o essential services, with the long-term objective o f gradually
relinquishing responsibility for MASAF-supported community projects entirely to the
Assemblies. M A S A F 3 will have a micro-credit component which will help communities
to save and borrow against their o w n funds. I t will also w o r k with the implementation
unit for the H I V / A I D S project to ensure that processes followed by communities seeking
HIV/AIDS-related support are harmonized as m u c h as possible.

59.
N e w IDA financing will include a planned Health project (tentatively a $15
m i l l i o n grant in FY05) focusing on: (i)
budgetary allocation and execution, concentrating
in part on securing financing for the Essential Health Package; (ii)
human resources
development and p o l i c y implementation, with a view to reversing the sector’s debilitating
fiduciary issues such as bulk pharmaceutical procurement (including
brain drain; and (iii)
through the Central Medical Stores) and financial management. The third component i s
particularly important, b o t h t o enable the national response to H I V I A I D S to be scaled up
effectively and to pave the w a y to the use o f pooled donor funds. The project will also
help to influence policies and resource-allocation decisions in t w o thematic areas o f
importance to Malawi, namely decentralization and public-private partnerships. W h i l e
the project i s not expected to contribute substantial n e w infrastructure-this i s not the
priority in M a l a w i now-it i s expected to make more effective use o f the infrastructure
that already exists.

IDA i s also preparing a n e w Education project (tentatively a $30 m i l l i o n
60.
credit/grant blend in FY06) w h i c h w o u l d build o n the Policy and Investment Framework
(PIF). The project will a i m to: (i)
rebalance the entire educational system and build a
foundation with other donors for a SWAP centered o n the Education F o r All goals; (ii)
improve the delivery o f education services, textbooks and other school materials directly
at the school level, with particular attention to the needs o f girls and H I V / A I D S orphans;
improve education quality, by targeting k e y aspects o f the delivery mechanism,
and (iii)
including teacher training, learning materials, supervision, incentives, accountabilities,
and management at the district level.

Box 11: Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps) and Development Partnerships in M a l a w i

A SWAP i s a n agreement between the Government and i t s development partners conceming sector
policies and strategies, resource projections to support strategy implementation, and common
management arrangements using national administrative systems to the fullest extent possible. Since the
M a y 2000 Consultative Group meeting in Lilongwe, the Government o f M a l a w i and i t s partners have
been committed to developing SWAps in health, education, and more recently H I V / A I D S . The reasons
are plain: SWAps discourage discrete free-standing donor projects in the relevant sectors, thereby
promoting greater organization and complementarity in each sector, lesser demands o n Government
capacity, and improved fiscal management (as all funding for the sector i s incorporated into the national
budget). In addition, by consolidating accounting, auditing and monitoring procedures, SWAps allow
donors to distance themselves f r o m day-to-day operational issues and enhance Government leadership,
transparency and accountability.
In Malawi, progress has been slow. The Government and its partners have been heavily involved in
attempting t o identify sector strategies and appropriate procurement, disbursement, management and
monitoring systems, but agreement remains elusive. Joining forces behind a common strategy has
occurred, to a degree, in health, education (the PIF), and H I V I A I D S . But key difficulties remain as a
result of the SWAp’s heavy reliance o n relatively weak national administrative systems as well as the
centralizing effect o f a single national funding system.
I t i s important for the Government and i t s extemal partners t o continue to pursue sector-wide
approaches. A working SWAP provides the most effective and efficient way to provide aid. I t i s also an
important step in donors’ efforts to move away f r o m project support-which often competes with
Government capacity instead o f enhancing it-and towards full-fledged budget support that i s not even
tied to a sector (as common funding mechanisms associated with SWAps s t i l l are). A key part o f IDA’S
strategy over FY04-06 will be to accelerate the transition f r o m a project-driven development program in
M a l a w i to a program that receives budget support. Progress w i l l depend largely o n Government success
in improving the quality o f public expenditure management and establishing effective leadership in the
sectors that will adopt a SWAp.

61.
Specific activities within the Health and Education projects will b e more fully
defined in light o f the findings o f an ongoing country status report for health (expected
in FY04) as w e l l as a country status report for education (planned for FY05); b o t h
status reports will focus o n aligning donor and Government programs, improving
implementation efficiencies, and monitoring outcomes. A Poverty Assessment that i s
planned for FY04 will contribute to project preparation as w e l l as to improving
Government capacity for results monitoring and evaluation.
The triggers for the base case lending program, w h i c h were outlined in paragraphs
62.
48 to 61, will be monitored o n an ongoing basis by the Bank’s Country Team and will
include:

capacity to implement substantial new lending programs i s l i k e l y to remain
limited.
The Health and Education projects could involve reduced lending amounts and
w o u l d anticipate significantly less progress in developing the national common
management arrangements that are required to m o v e a l l donors in the sector to
supporting a SWAP. In fact, if budget execution i s not deemed sufficiently
robust, the B a n k in the l o w case m a y need to make greater use o f Project
Implementation Units to ensure that project resources are properly spent and
accounted.

W h i l e M a l a w i remains in the l o w case scenario, the Bank will provide (a)
65.
analytical and advisory services aiming to help the Government to achieve a relatively
small number o f critical outcomes that will trigger a base case program as w e l l as (b)
selective financing, totaling about $105 m i l l i o n over three years, for projects that could
succeed even in a l o w case environment. Expected low-case outcomes w o u l d continue to
reflect PRSP priorities and w o u l d include: (i)
achieving macroeconomic stability and
completing delayed growth-promoting reforms in
improving economic govemance; (ii)
agriculture and promoting rural development; (iii)
improving access to, and the quality
of, basic health and education services; and (iv) controlling the spread o f H I V / A I D S .
Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) in the l o w case w o u l d include a l l activities
described in the base case; in addition, depending o n the reasons for Malawi’s continued
underperformance, the l o w case m a y include some additional AAA addressing issues that
are deemed to contribute most strongly to this underperformance.

66.

Triggers for the l o w case include:

a

Significant deviation f r o m poverty-reducing policies outlined in the PRSP
(including reductions in the share o f spending allocated to p r i o r i t y povertyalleviating activities such as primary education and primary health care).
Continued stagnation o r reversals in economic reform policies, especially related
to overall macroeconomic management, privatization and trade policy, leading to
a more closed and centrally-controlled economic environment.
Weak governance practices, political instability that cause external development
partners to continue to withhold budget support.
Significant deterioration in portfolio performance (with problem projects
exceeding 10% and disbursement ratio significantly less than 20% for an
extended period o f time).

The High Case Scenario

The C A S high case scenario envisages that the Government aggressively pursue
67.
the core reforms in paragraph 43 and complete them as rapidly as possible. Under this
scenario, lending amounts per annum could be increased to as m u c h as $100 m i l l i o n and
M a l a w i could make more rapid progress towards receiving B a n k assistance in
programmatic form. (Given Malawi’s current performance, i t will b e very difficult to
achieve the high case in FY04.) In particular, various W o r l d B a n k activities that are
planned in the base case could be expanded or accelerated in the high case:

The Health and Education projects could b e accelerated by one year, and more
rapid progress could b e made towards developing a SWAP in each sector as a
stepping-stone towards introducing Malawi’s first Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC).
In F Y 0 6 o r FY07, provided that sufficient progress had been made in improving
economic governance, macroeconomic management, and budget execution as
w e l l as in developing deeper sectoral programs in some o f the k e y social sectors,
programmatic lending could shift to a multi-year PRSC. This instrument w o u l d
maintain the focus o n expanding implementation capacity, particularly in public
institutions delivering services to the poor, as well as introduce a higher degree o f
continuity and predictability in IDA financing. I t w o u l d also support the more
demanding reforms required to establish market-oriented policies creating
incentives for private accumulation and also to orient public sector institutions to
service delivery complementing private initiative. The specific contents o f a
PRSC w o u l d depend in part o n the findings o f a Poverty Assessment drawing o n a
n e w integrated household survey as w e l l as a n e w PER focused o n the
management o f contingent liabilities and the medium-term wage policy, to be
completed at this time.
Finally, in the high case the B a n k could also support a n e w investment project
focused o n Infrastructure Development, with a v i e w to helping small- and
medium-sized enterprises to take advantage o f the more competitive business
environment resulting f r o m the achievement o f macroeconomic stability.

Triggers for the high case w o u l d include a l l o f the base case indicators listed in

Managing for Results

This C A S has been developed with a focus o n results (see Annex B11). I t l i n k s
69.
Malawi’s longer-term development agenda with selective outcomes to b e achieved during
the C A S period. This approach aims (i)
to set out a framework f o r future self-evaluation
and learning based o n outcomes, supported by the Bank’s program and relevant to
higher-order sector o r national goals (such as the MDGs); and (ii)
t o provide a
mechanism for better monitoring and management o f C A S implementation by
augmenting the monitoring o f inputs with outputs and outcomes. Development o f the
framework required greater selectivity and increased synergy across the portfolio where

- 34 -

lending and non-lending products contribute to more than one CAS outcome. The C A S
results framework shows the m a i n C A S outcomes (see Table 5 and Annex B9), the
relevancy o f these to the broader national goals, and Bank lending and non-lending
supporting them.
Measuring results: Against each o f the C A S outcomes, the Bank intends during
C A S implementation to monitor a set o f indicators to measure progress. In some cases,
these indicators are already quantified with expected target ranges (e.g. in the relevant
Project Appraisal Documents); in other cases more quantitative information o n baselines
and targets needs to be derived. Where there are gaps, the B a n k will w o r k with the
Government during the first year o f C A S implementation to identify specific
measurements o f outcomes. Where possible, the C A S will use data collection
mechanisms already in use for monitoring the PRSP.

70.

71,

Monitoring results: The PRSP defines monitoring and evaluation mechanisms
for i t s implementation, including an annual PER review and a comprehensive review
after three years. The C A S will use the existing system as m u c h as possible to monitor
C A S implementation, supported by normal portfolio supervision. The Bank’s CPPR will
be aligned with the annual PER review and will focus o n progress in achieving the m a i n
C A S outcomes, the risks and problems being experienced, and strategies for addressing
them.

72.

Managing to results: The C A S results framework sets out the outcomes to be
pursued in the C A S period. W h i l e specific operations are planned against these
outcomes, the C A S will respond to leaming and in-country changes and redirect
resources as needed. The B a n k will also help the Government to improve i t s
management to results, particularly in the area o f expenditure management; i t will also
assess h o w the Government does o r does not use results-based monitoring and evaluation
for p o l i c y and program decision-making. This review, w h i c h i s underway and will be
completed in FY04, will lead to recommendations for strengthening the Government’s
capacity, and these recommendations will feed into future IDA and partner operations.

73.

Country constraints: Weaknesses in Malawi’s monitoring and evaluation
framework impact the monitoring o f the PRSP and the CAS. These include:
0

0

0

Significant capacity constraints that impede the derivation o f information and i t s
use by the Government, w h i c h does not yet have a framework to link policy
decisions to the budget. M a n y PRSP objectives do n o t have monitorable
indicators to show whether they have been achieved; some are directly related to
the C A S outcome-level objectives.
Some outcome-level data for areas o f Bank intervention are dependant o n
administrative data w h i c h are weak or unreliable (especially in agriculture), or o n
additional information not identified in the PRSP (such as measuring financial
management improvements).
M a n y output-level indicators provided in the PRSP are general national figures
and m a y n o t b e adequately disaggregated for tracking outputs f r o m B a n k
supported interventions.

missing, they will b e derived, to the extent possible, during P R S P K A S implementation.
Discrepancies between Government and Bank data will be resolved, o n a project-byproject basis, during project supervision. In FY04, the B a n k will complete a diagnostic
analysis o f the country’s capacity to use results-based monitoring and evaluation for
p o l i c y and program decision-making, expenditure allocation decisions, and management,
and recommendations for strengthening capacity will b e fed into future operations. I f
desirable, the B a n k will help the Government to obtain IDF resources t o build capacity
for results-based monitoring and evaluation, based o n the review recommendations.
Given limitations in data reliability (especially regarding administrative and
disaggregated data), the B a n k i s also helping to assess the quality o f the statistical system
and develop a master plan for improving statistical capacity; and depending on the
findings o f this assessment, Government interest and the support o f other donors, the
B a n k m a y address some o f these constraints through the lending program.

6.

Risks and Risk Mitigation

75.
Six sets o f risks could impede C A S implementation. These require careful
monitoring and management by the Bank, in collaboration with other development
partners:

76.
Political developments: M a l a w i will have both Presidential and Parliamentary
elections next year. The political will to initiate o r complete controversial reforms m a y
weaken as the elections approach, or if a n e w Government i s formed. The results m a y
include slowing privatization, weak fiscal discipline, o r a failure to act decisively to
transform moribund sectors such as agriculture and health. T o mitigate this risk, the
B a n k will focus i t s p o l i c y dialogue w i t h the Government o n a number o f k e y matter,
deepen the dialogue o n those issues, broaden the audience involved, and continue to w o r k
closely w i t h key partners, including in particular the IMF and the C A B S donors.

77.

Failure to address capacity and governance issues: L i m i t e d human and
institutional capacity at a l l levels o f government could undermine PRSP implementation
and impede service delivery. Inadequate fiduciary controls and a failure t o strengthen
public financial accountability could result in increased corruption, w h i c h w o u l d further
undermine Government credibility and private-sector confidence and m a y prompt
development partners to continue withholding support. T o mitigate this risk, the B a n k i s
supporting FIMTAP as w e l l as the w o r k o f the A C B and completing a CPAR, a PER, and
an Institutional Govemance Review. I t i s also simplifying projects to ensure that they are
w i t h i n the Government’s implementation capacity.

78.

HIV/AIDS: The devastating effects o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic place serious

constraints o n Malawi’s growth potential in many ways: i t s impact o n the capacity o f the
c i v i l service and productivity across a l l sectors i s devastating. Failure o f leadership at a l l

- 37 -

levels o f society to bring about behavioral change will have an adverse effect on PRSP
and C A S implementation. The Bank and other partners are attempting to mitigate this
risk by helping the Government to strengthen the NAC and providing additional
resources for front-line implementers with experience in fighting H I V / A I D S .
Failure to strengthen M&E systems: M&E systems are very weak in Malawi,
79.
making i t difficult to track program implementation, with the result that expenditures
m a y b e inadvertently misdirected. The Bank i s mitigating this risk by helping the
Government to incorporate M&E as an integral part o f PRSP implementation (see
paragraph 65 above).

80.

Poor donor coordination: M a l a w i i s heavily dependent o n external aid, and
inadequate donor coordination could lead to duplicative efforts, multiple parallel
structures, and contradictory p o l i c y advice w h i c h will further erode the productivity o f
already weak institutions. T o mitigate this risk, the B a n k i s working closely w i t h other
donors to empower the Government to seize control of the development agenda (e.g. by
chairing aid-coordination meeting) and to harmonize policies and processes (e.g. through
developing SWAPS.)

8 1.

Vulnerability to exogenousfactors: Malawi’s economic prospects are linked to
those o f the region, and adverse economic developments in Mozambique, South Africa,
Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe could dampen growth prospects for Malawi. In
addition, climatic variations that adversely affect agricultural production and worsening
terms o f trade resulting f r o m commodity price shocks could threaten growth. On
occasion, resources that should have been used for development m a y need to be
reallocated to relief o r emergency activities, as was the case in 2002. In anticipation o f
these eventualities, the B a n k .is working with the Government and other donors to
diversify Malawi’s agricultural exports and develop a more robust food security strategy.

7.

Conclusion

82.
M a l a w i i s at a critical juncture. A series o f crises, including continuing
macroeconomic instability, adverse climatic variation leading to widespread food
insecurity, and political and economic governance problems that have strained donors
relations, have put Malawi’s development prospects at risk. With recent growth w e l l
below the levels required to reduce poverty, more Malawians are slipping into poverty
every day and the M i l l e n n i u m Development Goals (MDGs) remain distant. Moreover,
w i t h disappointing results in implementing the reform agenda and delays in completing
the first review of the PRGF arrangement, donors have either reduced their development
assistance to M a l a w i o r transformed i t into humanitarian assistance--a transformation that
helps to addresses the consequences o f crisis (but not the causes) and that m a y lead to
s t i l l poorer results in the future. The Government needs urgently to turn this vicious
circle into a virtuous one, by taking aggressive action n o w t o address the k e y
development issues that M a l a w i n o w confronts. This C A S aims to help the Government
to do so, by providing financing and analytical and advisory services that are tailored to
achieving a f e w outcomes that are critical to restoring Malawi’s development prospects.
By helping the Government to reduce the incidence o f HIV, achieve macroeconomic

- 38 -

stability, complete overdue reforms in the agriculture sector, and improve the delivery o f
basic health and education services, this C A S will make an important contribution to
creating a virtuous circle, thereby raising more and more Malawians to a higher level o f
prosperity.

Debt Sustainability, IDA Support and HIPC

1.
At end-2002, Malawi’s stock o f external debt was $2.8 b i l l i o n or 145% o f GDP.
N e a r l y 93% o f this debt i s o n concessional terms and about 80% i s owed to multilateral
organizations, o f which 63% i s owed to IDA. Given the highly concessional nature o f
the debt, the total scheduled debt service before any relief in 2002 amounted to 18% o f
the exports o f goods and services, o f which debt service to IDA amounted to 7%. On the
basis o f debt relief granted so far, the actual debt service ratio in 2002 was 8% o f the
exports o f goods and services.

2.
M a l a w i reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in
December 2000. The common reduction factor for all creditors at the decision point was
calculated to be 44% o f their exposure in net present value (NPV) terms after traditional
debt reli,efmechanisms. Based o n the projections presented in the decision point
document, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio with enhanced HIPC r e l i e f was expected to
rise t o almost 181% o f GDP in 2002l and fall below 150% only by 2014. However,
assuming further debt r e l i e f by Paris Club members beyond the enhanced HIPC2
initiative, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio would be brought down to below 150%
starting in 2006 and would average o n l y 137% over the 2000-1 9 period.
3.
The total assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative was estimated at the
decision point to be $643 m i l l i o n in NPV terms, equivalent to about $1 .O b i l l i o n in
nominal terms, o f w h i c h IDA’Scontribution was expected to b e $588 million, to b e
delivered through a reduction o f 56 percent o f debt service payments to IDA3over 20
years. Since the decision point, IDA, most other multilateral organizations and several
bilateral creditors have been providing interim reliefa4 The IMF provided interim relief
during 2001, but this r e l i e f has been suspended since early 2002. On average, during
2001 and 2002 the overall interim relief has been about 30% o f the total scheduled debt
service.
Over the past two years, Malawi’s economic performance has been lower than
was projected at the decision point, due to a combination o f p o l i c y shortfalls and external
shocks such as the food crisis in 2002. M a l a w i has not been able to conclude the first
review o f the IMF’s PRGF arrangment (the first review was originally scheduled for June
2001). This has resulted in continued macroeconomic instability and reduced availability
o f untied aid resources. At the decision point, GDP was projected to grow by 5% per
annum and exports by 7% per annum on average, but over the past two years b o t h GDP

and exports have remained flat. Consequently, the NPV o f debt-to-exports in 2002 i s
expected to b e 161% as opposed to thel50% anticipated at the decision point.

5.
Extemal debt sustainability has been examined under the base, l o w and high case
scenarios discussed in the m a i n document. Projections assume that M a l a w i w o u l d reach
completion point at end 20035. Progress towards meeting the completion point triggers
has been uneven. While M a l a w i has made progress by completing the full PRSP,
maintaining pro-poor expenditures, addressing HIV/AIDS, preparing the Fiscal
Management Act, the Audit A c t and the new L a n d Policy, there are t w o completion point
triggers towards w h i c h further progress i s needed. First, M a l a w i needs to achieve
macroeconomic stability and be o n track with the IMF program. Second, progress needs
to b e accelerated o n the reform o f the Central Medical Stores (CMS).
Under the base case scenario described in the m a i n text, w e expect GDP and real
6.
export growth rates to be, o n average, 3.8% and 4.0% per annum respectively over the
next ten years. The export growth rate o f 4.0% per annum i s slightly higher than the
long-term (1970-2000) growth rate o f 3.2% per annum, and i s predicated o n tobacco
export growth o f 2.2% per annum and manufacturing export growth o f 5.0% per annum.
The growth in tobacco exports i s feasible, provided there i s sustained progress (assumed
under the base case) in addressing supply chain inefficiencies affecting smallholder
burley farmers' access to the auction floor. Export growth in manufacturing will require
progress o n improving infrastructure, rationalizing incentives, and lowering inflation and
interest rates through achieving macroeconomic stability. On this basis, the NPV o f debtto-exports-the k e y indicator o f debt sustainability-is projected to rise to 177% by 2005
against the 150% projected when this analysis was performed at the decision point.

The projections did not explore implications o f interruption o f interim debt relief f r o m IDA o r other
donors. I t i s important to note that there i s a cap o n the IDA interim debt relief amounting t o 35% o f the
total NPV. O n the basis o f current trends, this cap i s expected t o be reached o n M a r c h 15, 2007.

The burden o f external debt in the l o w case will be higher than in the base case.
In the l o w case, GDP and exports are expected to grow at an average rate o f 2.0% per
annum and 2.1% per annum respectively over the next ten years. Under the l o w case, the
NPV o f debt-to-exports i s expected to remain at about 180% until the end o f the decade
and w o u l d o n l y reach the sustainable level o f 150% by about 2015. The higher debt
burden arises m a i n l y f r o m the lower growth rate o f real exports w h i c h i s to some extent
c o m ensated by lower import requirements arising f r o m a lower overall GDP growth
rate . Inthe high case, w h i c h assumes GDP and export growth rates o f 5.0% per annum
and 5.5% per annum respectively, will result in an NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio o f 150%

B

by 2008.

F o r M a l a w i to achieve and maintain a sustainable debt burden, i t will therefore
8.
need to complete a number o f measures. O f these, the most important involves
undertaking reforms that will attain macroeconomic stability, re-ignite growth, and lead
to a restoration o f bilateral and multilateral sources o f financing. Successfully reaching
the completion point i s also key. Nevertheless, because the debt profile even under the
base case has deteriorated compared to the profile projected at the decision point, i t will
also b e important for M a l a w i to approach the international community to address the debt
overhang at the completion point.
