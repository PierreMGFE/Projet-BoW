COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Today, Nepal stands at the crossroads between a brighter future that promises more sustained
poverty reduction and the possibility of the country becoming mired in a more protracted internal conflict.
During the past few years, the insurgency has escalated sharply, involving an open conflict with the army
since November 200 1. This, combined with external developments, has undermined the economy and
weakened the country’s fiscal position. Despite the many positive changes Nepal has seen since the
advent of multi-party democracy in 1990 and the first wave of economic liberalization measures in the
early-l99Os, the recent developments have highlighted the stark and worsening inequities in Nepal, not
only in terms of incomes, but also of the fundamental ability of the Nepali citizen to participate in social
and political decision-making processes. The deepening crisis, however, has also created the space for
the reform-minded political and technocratic leaders to begin a renewed drive to build an economic and
social foundation for sustained peace and poverty reduction.

Important reforms have emerged in several areas over the past two years. First, to prevent a
ii.
possible financial sector crisis, a key initial step was taken by putting the two ailing commercial banks
under external management teams. Second, facing up squarely to the fiscal pressures, His Majesty’s
Government of Nepal (HMGN) introduced a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in FY02/03
to rationalize the development budget and instill the discipline of a hard budget constraint. Third,
responding to the urgent need to improve public service delivery, HMGN has started to transfer key
services to community management in primary education and primary health care. Fourth, to ensure
implementation of priority reforms, HMGN devised an Immediate Action Plan (IAP) in 2002, which was
effectively used to hold relevant Ministries and Departments accountable for promised actions. Fifth, a
highly visible anti-corruption drive has been started by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of
Authority (CIAA), thereby giving Nepali citizens a hope that the days of rampant corruption may be
coming to an end. The recently adopted Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)-based on the Tenth Plan
(FY02/03-FYO6/07)-builds on these successes, and gives the reform process much greater strategic
coherence and clarity.
...

Nepal’s PRS breaks from the past, largely ineffective plans in a number of significant ways. For
the first time, it explicitly identifies social exclusion as one of the fundamental development challenges.
It also recognizes HMGN’s constrained fiscal situation and weak implementation capacity, and places the
PRS in a realistic framework of implementation abilities, both fiscal and institutional. Thus, the MTEF
gives it both a medium term fiscal fi-amework and annual budgetary translation of the strategy, while the
IAP will be used as an annual implementation plan for high priority reform actions that would receive
continual attention from the highest levels of HMGN. These two instruments and the track record of
significant early progress give the PRS considerable credibility. With the aim of reducing poverty and
improving critical public services, the PRS is built around four pillars: (i) broad-based economic growth;
(ii) social sector development; (iii) social inclusion; and (iv) good governance. In implementing it, the
PRS stresses decentralization, rationalization of central government functions and transparency.
111.

iv.
Despite the successes and a palpable change in the energy with which the reform leaders are
pushing the agenda at the center, the benefits of the reforms have not yet been felt widely at the grassroots
levels. There is clearly a need to accelerate the reform actions embodied in the PRS, including in
particular greater decentralization. This would be essential not only for rebuilding the people’s
confidence in the state, but also for making meaningful progress toward poverty reduction and achieving
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

..

- 11 Given the continuing political turmoil, the Bank no doubt faces a risky environment in which to
operate in Nepal. The Bank, however, should not lose sight of the most important risk the country faces,
and hence by extension the Bank also faces-Le., the risk of Nepal spiraling into a widespread armed
conflict and a breakdown of state institutions. In comparison, many of the other risks are modest if not
trivial. The current wave of reforms is a determined effort by the reform leaders to mitigate this
fundamental risk. Unlike in typical reform episodes, the leadership for change has come more from a
growing number of reform-minded technocrats and some enlightened political leaders who stand apart in
an establishment that has provided largely passive support rather than explicit leadership. Because of
this, the reform efforts may seem more tenuous and less spectacular. Nevertheless, the basic contents of
the reform program enjoys strong support from the population at large and at least tacit support from
mainstream political parties. This is not to minimize the risks that the reform process could be stifled by
myopic political interests or the implementation capacity is curtailed by hostilities. Implementation of the
Bank’s strategy will be cognizant of these risks.
V.

vi.
Through the lean years of slow reforms, the Bank worked consistently with reform-minded
leaders and facilitated the beginnings of the current reform process. The firm linking of lending levels to
actual reform implementation has challenged and inspired the reformers. And, an uncommonly strong
partnership has developed between these leaders and the Bank, with a strongly shared vision for the
reforms that Nepal needs. More importantly, the reformers have risen to the occasion and have begun
implementing the far reaching program articulated in the PRS. Because of the fiscal pressures,
accelerating its implementation will require increased external resource flows, particularly of a
programmatic nature. The Bank’s CAS for FY04-FY07 is designed to respond to this situation by
increasing financial support to facilitate Nepal’s own reform efforts. To align the Bank’s assistance
program with the PRS, the CAS will be fully outcomes-focused, continuing the outcomes-based approach
developed by the Nepal Country Team over the last two years.
vii.
Given the risks of politics getting in the way of reforms, the Bank will continue to maintain
sharply differentiated lending levels linked to progress on reform implementation. The base case
envisions an average annual lending of about US$190 million (consistent with the current IDA resource
allocation for Nepal), including programmatic support to facilitate accelerated implementation of the core
PRS priorities. If the reform process stalls (low case), the lending support will be curtailed sharply to a
range of US$O-50 million. In the high case-which is associated with peace and accelerated reformslending could increase to US$200-250 million annually. With the prevailing uncertainties, however, there
could be a need to revisit the strategy. As such, a CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) will be prepared in
approximately eighteen to twenty-four months, or sooner should the situation warrant.
viii.

The Executive Directors may wish to discuss:
The appropriateness of the basic strategy of providing strong support to Nepal’s PRS in the
face of significant political uncertainty;
0

0

The appropriateness of the outcomes-based approach outlined in the CAS; and

0

The choice of instruments to deliver the lending program.

ix.
In many respects, Nepal is truly at a critical juncture in its development process, and it is difficult
to predict which path the country will follow. While the on-going reforms offer the best hope for laying
the foundation for sustained peace and development, the insurgency makes their implementation more
difficult. Yet, one thing is clear. With strong support of the Bank as outlined in this CAS, the chances
are much greater that the reform program will succeed, and hence, lead eventually to real improvements
in the lives of Nepal’s poor and most vulnerable.

NEPAL
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
INTRODUCTION

1.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Nepal-considered by the Board on December
13, 1998-identified poor governance as the fundamental constraint restricting Nepal’s development.’
Since then, while there have been improvements, governance-broadly defined to encompass public
accountability, transparency and social inclusion-remains the country’s central challenge. In part
reflecting the structure of poor governance, over the last five years Nepal has gone through turbulent
times. Both growth and poverty reduction have suffered from a number of factors, including: (i)
successive ineffective Governments and a continuing unstable political environment; (ii) an escalation of
the insurgency, interspersed with two failed attempts at peace talks (in 2001 and 2003); and (iii) harsh
repercussions from the global economic slowdown that have severely affected Nepal.
2.
As reported in the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) of November 2002,’ despite this instability
and uncertainty-a perhaps because of it-ver
the last two years, Nepal has begun implementing an
impressive and far-reaching reform program. Notable progress has been made in financial sector reform,
public expenditures management, changes in public service delivery modalities, the fight against
corruption and the infrastructure regulatory environment. To give the reform process greater coherence,
the country has recently formulated a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).3 Nonetheless, the impact of the
reforms have not been felt widely enough to date and Nepal remains one of the world’s poorest countries,
with an annual per capita income of about US$230 and bleak social indicators. Nepal also needs to
address fundamental issues related to social exclusion and redress the widespread perception that the state
has been failing to deliver basic public services. While the on-going reforms offer the best hope for
laying the foundation for sustained peace and development, the insurgency makes their implementation
more difficult.
3.
Thus, Nepal is at a critical juncture in its development process today. Nepal may tie turning
toward a brighter future, but the risk of the country becoming mired in a more protracted internal conflict
cannot be discounted. Despite this unpredictable environment, there are several good reasons for the
Bank to formulate a new CAS at this time. Most fundamentally, a new CAS will allow the Bank to align
its assistance program closely to the current reform process embodied in the PRS, hence providing more
effective support and encouragement to the reform efforts. Moreover, contrary to the political turmoil
and uncertainties, in the last two years there has been much greater continuity and certainty in the reform
process, backed by broad support from the general public. As such, there is a solid process of change that
Bank assistance can and should support. This is not to minimize the risks the reform process faces, but all
the more reason the Bank should have a clear strategy to deal with the various possibilities.

THE CAS CONTEXT

Social Context

4.
Despite improving economic performance during the 1990s in which per capita income growth
increased to about 2.5%, Nepal remains extremely impoverished. Although the most ‘recent’ poverty
estimates are rather outdated4 and comparability among different poverty estimates is questionable, it is
possible to draw some broad conclusions regarding poverty trends over the last few decades.
Specifically:

The absolute number of poor in Nepal has increased since the mid-1980s;
The distribution of income has become more unequal throughout the country; and
Progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been slow.
The country will continue to face many challenges towards achieving the MDGs in the coming decade
(see Box 1 and Appendix I).

Nepal’s Current Position
As of 1995, it was estimated that about 40% of Nepal’s population lived on less
than US$l/day. There is little evidence that poverty has declined since the
1980s and the absolute number of poor has llkely increased.
There is evidence that the net enrolment rate of primary-aged children rose in
the 1990s reportedly to over 70% and the youth literacy rate increased to 63%.
There have been significant improvements in the relative access of girls to
school education during the 1990s (a ratio of girls to boys in primary/secondary
education of 82%); however, the ratio of young literate females to males is still
less than 60%, and Nepali women are still largely without voice and influence
in the public domain.

The most recent estimates are based on the 1995/96 Household Survey. A Nepal Living Standards Survey
(NLSS) was launched in early-2003 to update household level information on consumption, poverty and
their determinants. A full Poverty Report based on this survey will be finalized in FY05. For more details
on the poverty situation in Nepal, see the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

5.
With approximately 85% of the total population living in rural areas, poverty is largely a rural
phenomenon in Nepal-a rural poverty incidence of 44% compared to about 23% in urban areas.’ Of the
country’s ecological regions, poverty in the mountains, at about 55%, is significantly above the national
average, as it is in the more remote mid- and far-western districts (many of which are controlled by the
insurgents) where poverty is as high as 70%. While there have been noticeable improvements in human
development indicators in recent years, they are still quite low and show significant urbadrural and
geographical variations. There has been some progress in reducing gender disparities-e.g., life
expectancy, literacy levels, and school completion rates-but, great advances are still required for Nepali
woman to be considered truly empowered.

6.
As important, there are significant ethnic and caste-based disparities in what is recognized as a
largely pluralistic society with diverse ethnic, caste, linguistic and religious communities.6 Broad
linkages have been identified between caste and poverty, and caste and human development levels, and
there are some clear messages: (i) most of the Dalit population is disadvantaged; and (ii) there are striking
caste and ethnicity-based disparities in education. A number of factors-including its limited natural
resource endowment, land-locked and rugged terrain, and series of ineffective and unstable
Governments-have contributed to Nepal’s poverty problems. Adding to these, much of the economic
growth has been in non-agricultural sectors, leaving behind the majority of Nepalis living in rural areas.

B.

Political Context

7.
Nepal has seen extraordinary political instability in recent years-Le., there have been twelve
changes in Prime Minister in the past eight years. Peace has also eluded Nepal for more than seven years
while a violent insurgency has claimed over 8,000 lives and the remit of the state machinery shrunk
largely to urban and semi-urban areas in many districts (see Box 2). An important breakthrough was
made on January 29,2003 when His Majesty’s Government of Nepal (HMGN) and the insurgent leaders
agreed to a cease-fire. After three rounds of peace talks, however, the insurgents unilaterally called off
the cease-fire on August 27,2003, While all sides stress the need for a peaceful resolution of the conflict,
the path to peace is not obvious.
8.
On the political front, the Parliament was dissolved on May 22, 2002, and Mi-. Sher Bahadur
Deuba remained as caretaker Prime Minister for about six months. During this time, the terms of locally
elected bodies-both at the village/municipality and district levels-were allowed to expire in July 2002.
With an escalation of insurgency-related violence-in part a campaign to prevent elections-Mr. Deuba
recommended deferment of elections for over a year. This led the King to dismiss the Government in
September 2002, and has resulted in two successive interim Governments.

9.
The first interim administration-headed by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the
Rastriya Prajatantra Party (UP)-was appointed by the King on October 11, 2002 with a mandate,
among other things, to restore peace, hold the suspended elections, fight corruption and improve service
delivery. While public opinion was firmly behind the peace talks and supported the administration, the
main political parties-most notably, the split Nepali Congress (NC) Party and the United Marxist
Leninist Party (UML)-continually challenged the administration’s legitimacy. On the basis of the

Box 2: The Insurgency

The insurgency-previously a low intensity and
mainly rural campaign to form a ‘people’srepublic’-has
claimed more than 8,000 lives by official accounts and has
resulted in Nepal’s longest and bloodiest conflict since the
mid-1700s. It is clearly a political movement with a fm
political philosophy, but has gained strength because of
certain social-economic conditions, including in particular:
0
Horizontal inequality and social exclusion:
specifically, economic growth has largely benefited
Kathmandu valley residents, with the large impoverished
and deprived rural population-for decades a target of
social exclusion-witnessing little social and economic
progress; and
0
Failure of governance, including lack of delivery of
public services: specifically, weak institutions have failed
to meet the basic needs of the population and continue to
be linked with corruption, political infighting and
instability.
The insurgency has increasingly challenged the
fragile economy-the costs have been estimated at 8-10%
of GDP, including: (i) damage to infrastructure-e.g., over
1/3 of the 3,900 Village Development Committee (VDC)
buildings have been destroyed; (ii) lost economic activity
due to bandhs-i.e., strikes-that have been taking place
with greater frequency and often lasting 2-3 days; and (iii)
a generally low level of economic activity caused by
decreased business confidence and low tourism.
Furthermore, there have been large direct impacts on the
livelihoods of millions of primarily rural-based
individuals, for which killing, extortion, confiscation,
forced recruitment, and infrastructure destruction have
created fear and resulted in migration, decreased
agricultural production, and a decline in living standardsit is estimated that approximately 300,000 people have
migrated to the Kathmandu valley in recent years.

10.
As head of the second interim
administration, Prime Minister Thapa has been
vested with full executive powers to assemble an
all-party Government, but the five main political
parties have so far all declined to join, claiming
that the current administration is no different
from its predecessor. As such, the cabinet
contains only six additional members, all from
the RPP. Mr. Thapa has outlined a ten-point
agenda that includes: (i) resolving the
insurgency problem and establishing lasting
peace; (ii) creating an environment conducive to
local and general elections; (iii) establishing the
foundations
of
good governance
and
strengthening the administrative machinery; (iv)
effectively
implementing
anti-corruption
measures; (v) accelerating economic reforms
and facilitating an enabling environment for
investment; and (vi) building consensus for
political, economic and social reforms. In this
context, securing a lasting peace with the
insurgents, reaching a political settlement with
the parties and building an environment
conducive to holding elections all remain high
on HMGN’s agenda. Strongly related to this,
HMGN’s recent replacement of public servants
with political appointments in local bodies (see footnote 11) can be viewed as a precursor to local
elections. Nevertheless, the political situation remains tense and a speedy return to functioning
democracy does not appear imminent.

C.

Macroeconomic Performance and Medium Term Prospects

Since the last CAS, the Nepali economy has fluctuated. After growing at a rate of 5% per year
11.
during the 1990s, real GDP fell in FYO1/02 primarily due to declines in manufacturing and tourism (see
Table 1). A number of factors-including sluggish worldwide growth, the insurgency, market saturation,
and inadequate quality control and standards-contributed to the decline, as did irregular rainfall that
adversely affected agricultural production. More recently, there have been signs of a modest recovery
underway, with GDP growing by 2.3% in FY02/03. Economic activity picked up noticeably after the
January cease-fire with some recovery in tourism, transportation and other services, and certain
manufactured exports-especially garments. Nevertheless, the economy remains weak.

As imports have also somewhat rebounded, the current account balance recorded a slight deficit
(about 1% of GDP) in FY02/03. Remittances from Nepalese working abroad have grown tremendously

(estimated at around USS855 million in FY02/03), with this item now larger than the value of
merchandise exports. Gross official reserves remained high at about US$1.2 billion-about six % months
of import-at end-FY02/03. The external debt service ratio is low (about 7.5%) of exports of goods and
services, because of the highly concessional nature of external borrowing.

In recent years fiscal management has come under stress, as the worsening insurgency situation
and fragile economy contributed to weak revenue growth and security-related spending increased. In
FYO 1/02, revenues were below the budget target (despite serious collection efforts, including imposition
of special security surtaxes) and security spending was about 1% above the budgeted amount (although
still well below the level of similar spending in other countries in the region). Anticipating further fiscal
pressures, HMGN embarked on a bold fiscal consolidation exercise in FY02/03 that has been
implemented with a considerable degree of success.' Despite low levels of development expenditures in
FY02/03, pro-poor spending has been protected. Furthermore, with revenues increasing by 13% over the
previous year, the deficit before grants declined to 4% of GDP in FY02/03 (compared to the 1990s
average of 6%). Fiscal management will continue to be strengthened during FY03/04 and into the second
month of the fiscal year, budget implementation is strong. In the past, the deficit has largely been
financed by concessional foreign financing, however, in FYOO/Ol and FYO1/02 domestic financing rose
slightly. With successful implementation of the reform program, in the future it is envisioned that foreign
financing will increase.

productivity, and higher investment, in the medium term growth in Nepal is expected to increase to the
5% rates experienced during the 1990s.* There are, however, several key pre-conditions for these to
occur. First and foremost, renewed economic growth will require political stability and peace. Second,
Nepal will need to implement a range of growth-enhancing structural reforms to stimulate a more propoor and inclusive growth process, including: (i) enhancing the development impact of public
expenditures and improving tax administration; (ii) improving power, transport, banlung and
telecommunications services; (iii) boosting Nepal’s export competitiveness by addressing some behind
the border constraints; (iv) addressing sector specific reforms such as rationalizing irrigation subsidies in
agriculture and improving labor market flexibility for manufacturing and services; and (v) undertaking
governance reforms that enhance the impact of the structural measures.

15.
The macroeconomic framework recently agreed by HMGN with the Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as assistance from both institutions to implement the reform effortsthrough Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF)-will support Nepal’s attempts to achieve more sustainable growth. The key elements of the
framework are consistent with the PRS and include: (i) a fiscal strategy to improve revenue mobilization,
prioritize spending-towards social and infrastructure sectors to help reduce poverty-and contain
domestic borrowing over the medium term; (ii) a monetary policy geared to supporting the peg to the
Indian rupee; (iii) continuation of the financial sector reforms; (iv) public sector reforms including civil
service and public enterprise; and (v) governance reforms to strengthen the fight against corruption and
accelerate decentralization to local levels to improve accountability and service delivery.

Progress Under the Last CAS and Lessons Learnedg

CAS Implem entation
16.
Because of the limited and slow progress in
implementing the reform program, for much of the last
CAS period Nepal remained in a low case lending
scenario. Given the fungibility of aid resources,
without substantial improvement in the use of public
resources, more financial assistance from IDA would
not have been a solution to Nepal’s problems. HMGN
clearly began recognizing poor governance-reflected
most acutely in weak implementation of reforms, poor
service delivery and corruption-as a central obstacle
to development. Growing recognition of the gravity of
the financial sector conditions and their direct link to
the system of poor governance, led the Bank to attach
special importance to financial sector reform (see Box
3). As the first major step in reforming the financial
sector, the introduction of external management teams
in the two large ailing commercial banks became the
‘litmus test’ for moving into a base case scenario. By
the time of the December 2002 CAS PR significant

occasioned by heavy-handed state involvementhas resulted in problems of growing nonperforming assets and capital adequacy, and an

RBB and NBL-accounting for about 50% of total
banking system assets-are estimated to have had
losses (as of mid-1998) of as much as US$450
million-equivalent to about 46% of the budget or
8.6% of GDP. In late-2000, HMGN adopted a
strategy that commits to reducing the role of the
public sector in the sector as a direct owner of
financial institutions, while strengthening its role as
a supervisor and regulator of banks and financial
institutions (see paragraph 32).

Nevertheless, a key concern will be the removal of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) based quota

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

progress had been achieved toward implementing the reform program, including in the financial sector,
and hence the decision was made to move Nepal to the base case.

17.
While in the low case (late-1998 to late-2002), the lending program focused primarily on
infrastructure development, and four projects-in education, rural infrastructure, road maintenance and
telecommunications-were approved for a total of US$94.6 million. Strong emphasis was placed on
helping to build the agenda and needed consensus for reform. To a great extent, the introduction of a
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Immediate Action Plan (IAP-see paragraphs 2 124) have been prompted by the Bank’s
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA).
In addition to key formal reports (see Table
2), the Bank’s follow up through technical
assistance (TA) and intensive dialogue have
made significant contributions to the
foundations of many of the on-going and
envisioned reforms. Internally, the Bank’s
Nepal team has also moved to an outcomesbased work programming approach to
sharpen its focus on facilitating reforms (see
paragraph 49). Since the transition to the
base case in December 2002, three
additional projects (in the financial sector,
power development and education) have
been approved for a total of US$96.9 million.
Lessons Learned
18.
Today, there is a realization in Nepal that the Bank is truly concerned with the well-being of the
poor and that it is not possible to simply ‘negotiate’ aid out of IDA. In getting to this point, a number of
valuable lessons have been learned-both from our experiences in Nepal and world-wide, including
through instruments such as The Global Poll (May 2003). The following have taken into account in
developing this new CAS:
In an environment of poor governance, closely linking lending levels to progress in implementing
reforms and achieving results on the ground-not just promises+an provide significant leverage.
While such an approach by itself might not prompt reforms, when spontaneous reform initiatives
emerge, it can provide an important and constructive discipline to the process, and can even
strengthen the hands of reform leaders. In addition, this fosters peer pressure among senior officials
to look at development more holistically, as they realize that sectoral hnds could be blocked if the
overall progress is not made toward larger country goals (Le., governance);
A work program grounded in an outcomes framework encourages a more holistic and multisectoral approach for the Bank team. Outcomes need to be realistic and focus on those areas where
the Bank plays a significant role, with clear linkages to the country’s stated objectives;
To be most effective, consistent dialogue and investment in a solid relationship with key
counterparts are essential. In addition to building consensus for change/reform, such an investment
also builds and encourages ownership of and buy in for reform programs. Proactive outreach helps
build wider understanding of the development challenges and opportunities;

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

It takes time for reform to catch on; hence, there is a need to simultaneously develop ‘low case
appropriate’ interventions-typically modest in size and often supporting community-based projects
or small, sector-specific reform efforts;
0
The interplay of diverse political economy realities have an important impact on reform
implementation. These need to be better understood for the Bank to be more effective in identifying
and supporting emerging reform opportunities. When reforms do happen, they are often spontaneous
and episodic, and often fall outside conventional frameworks that donors are accustomed to.
Moreover, Government officials are not generally good at showcasing reform progress, nor are they
practiced at communicating successes to the public. These are important aspects to stress and take
into account if the benefits of reforms are to be the best arbiter for deeper reforms in the future;
0
The linkages between peace and stability, and poverty reduction are strong-possibly forming a
vicious circle. Development/poverty reduction can not be delayed or postponed until there is peace
and stability, as many of the root causes of conflict-i.e., failure of governance, including lack of
delivery of public services, and horizontal inequality and social exclusion-are often also the major
challenges of reducing poverty; and

Donor coordination is essential, but not always easy. Ultimately, the Government must be
encouraged to coordinate donor assistance by setting out its own development strategy and priorities.
Clearly, donors-including the Bank-need to respect Government efforts to ‘regulate’ and direct
foreign assistance.

NEPAL’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

The Reform Process

The Context: Nepal at the Edge of Chaos

19.
Nepal is struggling to emerge from a period of intense turmoil and its future hangs in balance.
The acutest form of this turmoil is the insurgency that escalated into a serious armed conflict involving
the army in November 2001. In the backdrop, however, had been growing disappointment with the
political and development processes that have failed to meet the aspirations of the people, which had been
raised after the reinstatement of a multi-party democracy in 1990. With the heightened level of hostilities,
the economy slowed and fiscal pressures built. When this crisis did not seem to prompt political leaders
into serious corrective action, the frustration of many turned into a sense of alarm that the nation was
heading for a catastrophe. From this deep sense of crisis, a new wave of reforms was born. It is being led
by a growing number of reform-minded technocrats and some enlightened political leaders.
20.
An important beginning was made at the Nepal Development Forum (NDF) in March 2000,
where HMGN announced a comprehensive reform program that focused on improving governance and
reducing poverty. As the severity of the financial problems of the two largest commercial banks became
apparent in 2001, reformers became alarmed by the prospect of a financial sector crisis and began to use it
as a focal point of the reform process. Then, with the fiscal situation deteriorating rapidly in 2002,
HMGN started to use this as a driver for public expenditure reform. At the same time, to respond to the
serious challenges caused by the insurgency, reformers began to design radical ways to improve public
service delivery even under severe fiscal constraints. By the beginning of FY02/03, these somewhat
disparate initiatives took shape as a more cogent strategy, embodied in the IAP and the financial sector
reform program that would place the two ailing banks under external management as the first step. An
integral part of the IAP has been the introduction of the MTEF to substantially rationalize the
development budget. In parallel, after its legal framework was strengthened in 2002, the Commission for

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) started to take some highly visible actions against senior civil
servants and politicians on corruption charges." This has been met with enthusiastic support from the
general public. As explained below, the PRS builds on these reform successes and expands the scope of
reforms, with a more integrated approach within a medium term perspective.

The Immediate Action Plan
2 1.
In June 2002, HMGN adopted the IAP that was designed to expedite reforms in three critical
areas-prioritizing public expenditures, improving service delivery, and strengthening anti-conuption and
accountability measures. Recognizing their weak implementation capacity, HMGN took pains to keep
the plan selective. Main IAP actions included: (i) tting a realistic budget ceiling and eliminating a
number of low priority projects; (ii) assuring

successes have not translated into significant
impacts on the lives of average citizens at the
grassroots levels, especially in rural areas. To make the reform process meaningful and sustainable, there
is an urgency to accelerate the implementation, especially of the reforms that bring quick impact to the
community level. The 2003 IAP is designed with this objective in mind. Lengthy delays in local
elections, however, present an obstacle, as they have dampened the momentum for decentralization. In
many Districts, locally elected District Development Committee (DDC) and Village Development
Committee (VDC) chairs (who had executive power) tended to be strong promoters of change at the
grassroots level."

In FY02l03, the CIAA filed 154 cases in various courts. Of these, the Special Court for corruption has
passed judgment on 55 cases, of which 43 have been in favor of the CIAA. The most prominent cases,
however, are pending.

11

To fill the vacuum at the local level, recently the cabinet appointed numerous DDC and municipality

officials, including some former DDC chairs, vice chairs and mayors. After experimenting with running
local bodies through civil servants, HMGN concluded that local bodies were better governed by political
leaders; hence, the appointments.

Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Adjustments
22.
Based on the recommendations of the 2000 Public Expenditure Review (PER)I2 and the work of
the Public Expenditure Review Commission (PERC) in 2001, and prompted by the worsening fiscal
situation, HMGN decided to introduce an MTEF starting in FY02/03. Overcoming the entrenched
tendency to seek increased foreign aid to cope with fiscal stress, the reform-minded National Planning
Commission (NPC) and Ministry of Finance (MOF) used the fiscal pressures to motivate serious
adjustments in budget allocations. This led to elimination of 160 low priority projects (out of 625
projects) in the FY02/03 budget. Further cuts in projects would have been desirable, but were politically
impossible. Instead, HMGN chose to be pragmatic and opted for an unorthodox solution in which
remaining projects were classified into three priorities-P1, P2, and P3. While funding for the top
priority (Pl) projects was assured, funding for lower priority (P2 and P3) projects would be contingent on
actual availability of funds after all P1 projects are adequately funded.13 While seemingly vulnerable to
political pressures, NPC and MOF nevertheless managed to use this system effectively to concentrate
funding to the P1 projects and within a year established a clear understanding among line ministries of the
seriousness of this prioritization exercise.
23.
At the same time revenue growth was slowing during the last two fiscal years, security spending
was increasing sharply as the level and scale of the insurgency escalated. From a very modest level of Rs.
7 billion (1.9% of GDP) in FYOO/O 1 to support the police and a small standing army, security spending
rose to about Rs. 15 billion in FY02/03. While in principle this increase was detrimental to the
development efforts, NPCMOF turned it to its advantage. As the increase in security spending was an
absolute imperative, the resulting severe fiscal pressure made it easier to impose a hard budget constraint
on line ministries and politicians who had been accustomed to much softer budget constraints in the past.
The majority of the cuts hit low priority, politically motivated projects. Total development spending
declined from Rs. 37 billion in FYOO/Ol to Rs. 27 billion in FY02/03. The developmental impact of this
reduction appears to have been relatively modest, as most of the dropped and P3 projects had been ill
conceived to begin with and receiving only modest annual funding without any realistic hope of
completion in the foreseeable future.
24.
In the meantime, through reforms to decentralize service delivery modalities-not only in
primary education and health care, but also in agricultural services-the quality of recurrent spending has
started to improve. In FY03/04, further measures are anticipated in this regard, including: (i) the
operationalization of an autonomous Roads Board that is expected to bring more rationality and
transparency to the allocation of road maintenance budget; (ii) incentive grants to schools that improve
enrolment of disadvantaged groups; (iii) implementation of the essential health care package approach to
focus the limited resources on priority health issues; and (iv) greater participation of the private sector in
infrastructure services--e.g., establishment of the Power Development Fund (PDF) to promote private
investment, introduction of a rural telecommunications operator and opening the licensing system for
private cellular operators. In effect, HMGN has been able to turn the fiscal and service quality crises into
an opportunity to establish a leaner and more efficient public spending program. As Nepal begins to
implement its PRS in full scale and increase expenditures to support it, far greater impact from additional
spending can be expected than in the past.

To deal with unexpected revenue shortfalls, the budget should include some lower priority projects. The
FYO 1/02 budget, however, contained more projects than the most optimistic revenue projection could fund.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy

Background
25.
Nepal’s PRS is based on the reform successes and limitations it has seen over the last two years,
and gives the process a broader, and longer-term vision and strategic coherence. Early on, HMGN
decided that the Tenth Plan (FY02/03-FYO6/07) would form the basis for its PRS. Many of the past
plans, however, have suffered from a number of weaknesses, including in general an overly optimistic
fiscal framework and limited focus on implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Therefore, while
relying on the planning framework that was familiar to HMGN, the NPC managed to build the recent
reform experience (in particular IAP and MTEF) into the PRS and make it a far more credible strategy
than any recent five-year plans.
26.
The PRS identifies reducing the overall poverty ratio from about 40% to 30% by the end of the
Tenth Plan (FY06/07) as its key target. Other targets include: (i) raising the above 15 literacy rate from
49% to 63%; (ii) reducing the infant mortality rate from 64 to 45 per 1,000 live births; (iii) raising life
expectancy from 62 to 65 years; and (iv) increasing access to drinking water to 85% of the population
(from 72%), access to electricity to 55% (from 40%), and providing telephone facilities to every VDC.
To meet these objectives, the PRS is formulated around four key pillars:
Achieving sustained high and broad-based economic growth, focusing particularly on the rural
economy;
0

Accelerating human development through a renewed emphasis on effective delivery of basic
social services and economic infrastructure;
0

Ensuring social and economic inclusion of the poor, marginalized groups and less developed
regions; and
0

Vigorously pursuing good governance both as a means of delivering better development results,
and ensuring social and economic justice.
0

27.
In implementing these pillars, the strategy stresses four cross-cutting themes: (i) re-defining the
role of the State and limiting public interventions; (ii) promoting private sector development and enlisting
the involvement of the private sector, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International NonGovernmental Organizations (INGOs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs); (iii) supporting
greater social diversity in the structure of governance at all levels, and more socially and geographically
inclusive access to social and economic services; and (iv) accelerating the decentralization process,
including community participation in and management of activities at the local levels.

28.
The PRS recognizes that the four pillars are closely inter-related and address different aspects of
the same problem. Nevertheless, each pillar is described separately both in the PRS and below.
Furthermore, as a foundation for broad-based economic growth, the PRS recognizes the need for an
appropriate enabling environment and macroeconomic stability. Thus, the PRS incorporates a sustainable
macroeconomic framework, whose objectives include: (i) maintaining fiscal discipline; (ii) ensuring
efficient use of public resources; and (iii) sustaining monetary and external stability. This is
complemented by a structural reform agenda that aspires to make the public sector more diverse, efficient
and effective, remove constraints to private sector competitiveness and improve the conditions of the
poor. In this regard, key reforms are envisioned in: (i) public finance, including public expenditure
management-i.e., implementation of the MTEF; (ii) financial sector reform; (iii) improving the
competitiveness of private sector, including trade and labor market reform; (iv) governance, including
civil service reform and decentralization; and (v) promoting private sector involvement in infrastructure.

Broad-Based Economic Growth
29.
The PRS argues that higher growth will be achieved through greater productivity in agriculture
and non-agriculture, along with recovery in manufacturing, tourism and exports. The agricultural growth
strategy-the Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP)-aims to modernize, diversify and commercialize crop
and livestock production by expanding the use of technology and increasing the access of farmers to
modem agricultural inputs and credit. This strategy is closely linked to ground water development (Le,,
irrigation strategy), increasing rural infrastructure (i.e., rural electrification and rural roads) and
sustainable development of the forestry sector.

30.
In the non-agriculture sectorfor which manufacturing, trade (see Box
5 ) , tourism, transport, construction, and
financial and social services are
explicitly recognized as key subsectors-the
emphasis is on reducing
the role of the State in economic
activities and creating an environment
more conducive to private sector
investment. The strategy includes: (i)
removing the impediments to private
sector development; (ii) accelerating
privatization of state owned enterprises
(SOEs)I4; (iii) streamlining regulatory
processes and making them more
transparent; (iv) amending labor laws to
make them more flexible; and (v)
introducing important private-sector
friendly legislation and judicial reform.
In parallel, reforms will be implemented
in corporate and financial governance.

Box 5: Improving Nepal’s Trade and Competitiveness
The trade to GDP ratio in Nepal is about 50%. With
regard to exports, Nepal is dependent on a relatively small
number of products-ready-made garments and carpets account
for nearly 60% of exports-with exports to North America,
Europe and India accounting for 95% of the total. Despite this
narrow basis, trade was a key factor behind the acceleration of
Nepal’s economic growth in the 1990s.
Along with Sri Lanka, Nepal has the most liberalized
trade policy in South Asia. However, there are significant
constraints-including delays in customs and transshipment, an
extremely rigid formal labor market, infrastructure, and
ineffective and unpredictable public sector policies and
institutions-that constrain the country’s trade prospects. A
recently completed study-The Nepal Trade and Competitiveness
Study led by the Bank under the auspices of the Integrated
Framework (IF)-provides recommendations on key issues, such
as Nepal’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
improving competitiveness and productivity, and facilitating
trade. Nepal faces significant challenges for realizing its export
potential in the medium term, including the forthcoming phasing
out of the MFA, the accession of China into the WTO and a more
restrictive trade treaty with India. As improving competitiveness
is an important component of the growth agenda, the Bank will
continue to work closely with Nepal’s other development
partners supporting follow up of the key IF recommendations.

31.
The PRS places importance on
infrastructure
development
in
facilitating private sector development,
and hence gives priority to the strategic
road network, maintenance of major roads and highways, and expansion of infrastructure in electricity
and communications. The intention is for the private sector to play a more prominent role in these
sectors, as well as to clarify the roles and responsibilities of private and public operators. Examples of
reforms initiated andor envisioned in the near future include: (i) in roads, improving road maintenance
through establishment of an autonomous Road Fund Board and transferring to DDCs the responsibility
for development and maintenance of rural roads; (ii) in electricity, internal unbundling of the Nepal
Electricity Authority (NEA), establishment of a PDF and creation of an independent regulatory agency;
and (iii) in information and communications, conversion of the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation
(NTC) into a public company under the Company Act, opening up general and rural telecommunication
services to the private sector and establishment of a legal framework creating functional autonomy of the
postal service. Infrastructure development is also critical for agricultural growth and productivity
14

While budgetary transfers to SOEs averaged 1.8% of GDP over the last three years, total contingent
liabilities are unknown. To estimate privatization costs, HMGN has stepped up carrying out audits in
public enterprises and Bank sector work in this area is planned for FY05 (see Table 4).

improvements, and as such, the strategy emphasizes the infrastructure developments needed to meet these
objectives.
32.
Finally, it is recognized that a strong financial system is of critical importance for private sector
development. In this respect, the PRS envisions continuing implementation of Financial Sector Strategy
(FSS), which includes among other things: (i) restructuring and privatizing the two large ailing state
banks; (ii) strengthening the monitoring and regulatory capacity of the Central Bank; and (iii)
strengthening the legislative and institutional framework for the sector.
Social Sector Development
33.
The PRS outlines the importance of improving service delivery through a gradual process of
decentralization and greater empowerment of local communities in the management of social services. In
education, guided by the goal of ‘education for all,’ the strategy aims at improving the access to and
quality of primary education. In doing so, a key objective is to expand literacy programs, with special
emphasis on improving educational attainment and thus, the livelihood opportunities of historically
excluded groups, especially girls, Dalits and disadvantaged ethnic groups. At higher levels-i.e.,
secondary, vocational/technical and tertiary-the objectives are similar, with emphasis on producing
manpower with higher skill levels. To achieve this, the strategy is to decentralize management of schools
to local school management committees (SMCs) at the lower levels and to the governing body of the
individual institutions at the tertiary level, This process at the primary level-a fundamental shift from
the currently centrally-managed system-has begun over the past year with over 250 schools transferred
by end-September 2003 and an additional 500 applications pending approval. In addition, the strategy
envisions implementing a program of targeted scholarship programs for girls and children from Dalit and
disadvantaged ethnic minority families.

In health, the objective is to increase and extend essential health care services to all, with special
34.
emphasis on poor populations living in rural areas. To this end, the sector strategy focuses on
implementing an essential health care package that is based on preventative care, maternal and child
health, and family planning. Improvements in service delivery are also expected to occur through a
process of devolving health facilities-starting with sub-health posts-to local communities and working
increasingly with the private sector and NGOs. Related to this, the PRS elaborates on the importance of
access to safe water for health outcomes and aims to increase access in rural areas. Key actions focus on
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing projects, and developing new projects using the demand-driven
user group participation and empowerment approaches supported by the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Fund Development Board (Le., ‘Fund Board’). In urban areas, the focus will be on improving
delivery of utility services, and water supply and sanitation management in some major towns is to be
contracted out to the private sector over the next few years.
Social Inclusion and Targeted Programs
35.
At the core of this pillar is a specific commitment that in the implementation of all PRS pillars,
efforts to reduce gender and ethnidcaste-related disparities will be mainstreamed, and in new programs
emphasis will be placed on ensuring equity of access for all, with special attention to the most vulnerable.
In addition, the PRS proposes targeted programs for women and the most vulnerable poor ethnic
minorities living in remote areas. The PRS reviews the weaknesses of past efforts and discusses using
new mechanisms (e.g., the Poverty Alleviation Fund-PAF) and analytical tools (e.g., poverty mapping
data) to improve effectiveness. The PRS also stresses the need for ‘quick results’ in order to gain the
confidence of those who have thus far been left behind by development efforts.

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

36.
The PRS lists a number of areas-including agriculture, forestry, wage employment and social
sectors-where special efforts will be made to mainstream and empower women, Dalits and the
disadvantaged through a variety of means, including targeted programs. Other reforms include: (i)
revising existing laws to eliminate legal discrimination against women; and (ii) implementing affirmative
action programs to increase the social diversity of public service. The approach to mainstreaming
deprived communities and other vulnerable groups will be similar, in that emphasis will be placed on
ensuring social inclusion in all programs.
37.
Recognizing the limited effectiveness of targeted programs in the past, the PRS has adopted some
new approaches, including, among others: (i) merging programs similar in nature; (ii) establishing PAF as
an umbrella organization for targeted programs; and (iii) adopting a population and poverty-based
resource allocation formula for fund transfer to the districts. To achieve its goals the PRS proposes to
implement an integrated infrastructure development program (drinking water, small irrigation, schools,
health posts and trails) in remote areas through local government, CBOs and NGOs.
38.
In parallel, HMGN has shown serious commitment to addressing the inclusion agenda at the
political level. In the context of the last round of peace talks, while adhering to constitutional monarchy
and multi-party democracy, HMGN also proposed far-reaching reforms to the parliamentary system. The
proposals included, among other things: (i) proportional representation in Parliament (as opposed to the
‘first-past-the-post’ system copied from the Westminster model); (ii) reforms to ensure wider
representation in the Upper House of Parliament; (iii) strengthening of the prime ministerial system (with
a provision to allow non-elected technocrats to be included in the cabinet); (iv) constitutional reservations
for under-served and under-represented groups; (v) consolidation of local government structures, and
wider powers and responsibilities to the local level; and (vi) a constitutional provision for referenda on
issues of national significance.

Good Governance
39.
The PRS recognizes that improving governance is essential if the reforms are to stimulate propoor growth, improve service delivery and lay the foundation for lasting peace. HMGN’s strategy to
improve governance covers: (i) civil service; (ii) financial management and accountability; and (iii)
decentralization. While HMGN has made some ‘progress in improving human resource management
practices over the past few years-most notably through the creation of a computerized personnel
information system-the PRS recognizes that additional progress is needed to make the civil service more
efficient, accountable and transparent. Future actions include: (i) reforming public employment through
introduction of merit-based recruitment and evaluation systems and a long-term pay policy, as well as
right-sizing, improving the capacity and skills mix, and introducing an affirmative action program; (ii)
improving financial management and accountability through among other thmgs, implementing the
recommendations of the recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment; and (iii) implementing the
anti-corruption strategy, in part through the enactment of an Anti-Money Laundering Act” and
strengthening key institutions charged with fighting corruption, including the National Vigilance Center
and the CIAA.

15

Related to this, last year HMGN expressed interest in receiving assistance to begin the process of
establishing a regime to protect the financial sector from money laundering and the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT). If legislation is enacted as envisioned, a number of steps-including establishing an action
plan for issuing regulations and guidelines, and creating the necessary institutional structures-will be
required to implement and enforce the new law. The Bank stands ready to assist in these efforts.

Assessment of the PRS

40.
The Tenth Plan/PRS has been
developed in the context of the current
political turmoil in Nepal in a relatively
participatory manner (see Box 6). Although it
stands on the tradition of the periodic plan
process, the PRS has been able to break from
the historical baggage of the established
process in a number of important ways. While
the implementation strategy of the PRS is not
as sharply explained as one might like, the
PRS relies on several strategic and crosscutting instruments to achieve its basic
objectives, including: (i) decentralization; (ii)
re-defining the role of the State and
reinforcing market functions; (iii) changing
public service delivery modalities; (iv)
strengthening accountability mechanisms; (v)
maintaining macro/financial discipline and
improving public expenditure management;
(vi) targeted programs; and (vii) increasing
investment in infrastructure and agriculture.

41.
Beyond the more thoughtful structure
of the poverty-focused strategy, there are
several things that give the Tenth Plan/PRS
considerable credibility, including:

Box 6: The PRS Consultation Process
The Tenth Plan/PRS adopted a participatory and relatively
‘bottom up’ approach. An extensive consultation process
was initiated at various levels to discuss and solicit feedback
on the ideas and recommendations presented in various
drafts. Consultations were initiated in August 2000 with
numerous public meetings held-two
exclusively with
women’s groups-in eastern, central and western Nepal
bringing together representatives from all 75 DDCs and all
facets of civil society (Le., socially excluded, minorities,
academics, private sector, NGOs/CBOs). Additional regional
consultations were held in June 2001 to discuss the draft
Tenth Plan Approach Paper, as well as linkages between
district plans and the national plan. The Approach Paper was
then finalized and discussed in the National Development
Committee (NDC)-composed of all Ministers, Secretaries,
and representatives of all political parties, private sector,
academia, ethnic minorities, labor unions, women, NGOs
and CBOs-in
January 2002. These efforts were
complemented by consultations organized fkom time to time
by various agencies responsible for developing key sectoral
programs, thematic chapters and background papers.
Throughout this process, broad consensus and wide support
have been developed for the PRSheforms. However, the
conflict likely constrained the consultation process in some
parts of the country and HMGN intends to address this once
it is feasible. With support from the development partners
HMGN is developing a comprehensive participatory
implementation, monitoring and evaluation strategy. The
exercise will be completed by end-2003, with civil society to
play a prominent role in monitoring efforts.

0
Acknowledging the difficulty of
getting away from the tradition of an ‘all
encompassing plan’ document, NPC
condensed the voluminous Tenth Plan in the traditional mold into a lean summary-Le., the PRS.
This shows HMGN’s ability to be selective and strategic, indicating the seriousness attached to the
PRS .
0
The PRS is backed by the MTEF, giving budget prioritization a serious framework. Also, the
performance-based cash release system for the high priority projects is forcing a greater focus on
implementation performance.
0
Through the IAP, HMGN has succeeded in being selective in reform actions and building an
internal consensus on the absolute necessity for implementing the relatively few commitments made
under the IAP. HMGN now intends to use the annual IAP process as the instrument to ensure
implementation of a small set of key reforms to support the PRS on a priority basis.I6 By recognizing
its own implementation capacity limitations and by devising a practical instrument to manage this
problem, HMGN has shown a real seriousness about implementing the PRS.

The reformers are far more serious about poverty reduction, with particular focus on inclusion.
One thing the insurgency has done is to force the Kathmandu-based power elite to think about Nepal
as a nation state that will survive only if glaring disparities in living standards, and access to political
0

16

In a sense, IAP is the equivalent of the MTEF with regard to ‘reform implementation resources.

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

and economic powers are rectified. This seriousness is reflected in a frank admission in the PRS
about past failures and exclusionary consequences of poor public policies and commitment to
addressing them; and
0
The people are demanding the kind of changes that the PRS envisions, thereby giving the PRS the
political impetus, legitimacy and sustainability.

42.
Thus, the PRS, combined with the MTEF and IAP, form a sound basis on which to build the
Bank’s CAS.17 A Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the PRS was carried out by staff of the Bank and the
IMF in July 2003.18 In addition to highlighting the strengths of the PRSP-many of which are listed
above-the JSA suggests a number of shortcomings and challenges on which HMGN will have to focus
on in the coming year, including the need to:
0

Identify the sources of growth, along with the key linkages to poverty reduction;
Address gaps in costing and prioritization, and link these to the annual budget and MTEF;

Implement a coherent monitoring and evaluation strategy, including building capacity for poverty
monitoring within a clear institutional framework; and
0

Further elaborate pro-poor rural strategies, especially to ensure social inclusion through changes
in the way in which public services are delivered in all sectors.

THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

A.

The Context

43.

The Bank finds itself in a particularly strong partnership with HMGN. More specifically:
While many aid agencies maintained high levels of aid to Nepal in recent years, the Bank took a
firm position on governance and sharply cut back new lending during FY99-FY02. Highlighting
poor governance as the central obstacle to development, the Bank’s stance strongly resonated with the
reform-minded in Nepal. It has also convinced HMGN that the Bank is not driven by any ‘lending
pressure’ and that it is truly concerned with poverty reduction. The Bank can, therefore, engage in
policy dialogue from a position of considerable credibility;
0

0
The Bank has been closely supporting several key reform measures taken over the last few years,
including the MTEF, the IAP, financial sector and transfer of public schools to community
management. This has established unusually strong collaboration between the reform leaders and the
Bank. In many areas, the Bank is relied on as a trusted advisor to the reformers, giving the Bank an
important role as a ‘facilitator of change’; and
0
The Bank is the only donor with significant headroom for increasing lending levels just when
HMGN is in serious need of additional resources, especially programmatic support. This gives the
Bank not only strong influence, but also a heavy responsibility as the fiscal ability to implement the
PRS may depend to a large extent on what the Bank decides to do.

17

These are also the basis for the IMF PRGF. For more details on the IMF program in Nepal, see footnote 41
and Appendix IV.

18

The complete PRS policy matrix is contained in Annex B1 1. T h s matrix-in which the outcomes and
milestones supported by this CAS are highlighted-also elaborates other donor support to realizing the
PRS objectives and outcomes.

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

Page 17 of 34

44.
Furthermore, in each of the PRS pillar areas, the Bank has already undertaken considerable
background work, and as such, has a strong base to build on. In broad-based economic growth, the
Bank’s assistance over the last few years has focused heavily on the quality of public expenditures, the
soundness of the financial system and the investment climate (see Box 7). The Bank has also supported
reforms and investments in key infrastructure sectors, like the main road network, inland container
terminals and customs facilities, rural roads, power generation, and telecommunications.’9 In agriculture,
the Bank has supported transfer of small irrigation schemes to farmer management, and improvement in
research and extension services.
45.
In human development, the Bank has
focused on improving the quality of education
and health care, through a HMGN-led, sectorwide approach. Supported by the analytical
work completed in FYOl (i.e., Priorities and
Strategy in Education Sector Reform) there
has been considerable progress in basic and
primary education, with a number of donors
participating in a basket funding approach to a
common program. The Bank has also played
a pivotal role in supporting the transfer of
public schools to community management. In
health, the Bank is actively supporting an
important shift to a sector-wide approach, as
well as the devolution of sub-health posts to
local communities. Furthermore, the Bank has
been instrumental in expanding demanddriven, community-based rural water and
sanitation schemes.

Box 7: The Business Environment in Nepal
An investment climate survey-The Business Environment
and Manufacturing Performance in Nepal-was finalized
in FYO1. Based on a survey of private manufacturing
enterprises, the report’s key findings are that poor
implementation of reforms, bureaucratic burdens and
continued politicaVpolicy uncertainties are the greatest
obstacles to doing business in Nepal. More specifically,
although policies are often perceived as well-designed,
they are often changed and implemented so inconsistently
that they contribute to an unpredictable and risky business
environment. In addition, firms suffer considerably from
excessive bureaucratic red tape, long delays in provision
of public services and having to deal with corrupt public
officials. These problems are often facilitated by lack of
clarity in laws and regulations, and unpredictability and
inconsistencies in policies. The implementation of the tax
regime, import regime and labor laws are specific areas
that significantly affect f m s and need to be urgently
addressed. Private sector development-including
establishg a supportive business environment-will be
an important theme in the Bank’s work under the broadbased economic growth pillar.

46.
In the area of inclusion, aided by a
policy
note-Towards
a
Sustainable
Approach for Poverty Reduction and
d&entralization-the
Bank has led the dialogue on the PAF and encouraged HMGN to use this as the
main instrument to reach out to marginalized groups that tend to be overlooked by existing institutions.
In specific community-based projects-e.g., Rural Water and Sanitation-the Bank has begun to address
social exclusion issues more vigorously. In promoting universal primary education, the Bank has also
been engaging HMGN to design ways to improve access by disadvantaged groups.
47.
In governance, the Bank has taken a very clear and strong stance since the last CAS. The
reforms in public expenditure management and banking are as much about governance as efficiency.
Decentralization has also been a key focus area, both through specific projects that have tried to give local
governments greater roles--e.g., Rural Infrastructure LL-and
through analytical work-focusing
especially on the fiscal decentralization framework. The Bank, in close coordination with committed
HMGN teams, has conducted a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR, FYO1) and County
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY02), and in each case is following up with Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grants to strengthen relevant institutions and implement main policy

recommendations (see Appendix V). Finally, anti-corruption actions have been a continual theme in the
Bank’s policy dialogue.
The Bank’s Strategy for FY04-FY07

B.

The Strategy: PRS-Based and Outcomes-Focused

48.
The Bank’s strategy will build on the achievements under the 1998 CAS-which in short were to
facilitate the beginnings of determined reform efforts-and support the Nepali-led reform process in a
significant span and depth. Thus, in operational terms, it may seem to be simply supporting key elements
under each of the PRS pillars. It is, however, backed by a successful process of supporting the reform
dynamics that have been gaining strength. This strategy was presaged in the CAS PR which articulated
continuation of focus on improving governance-by bringing resources to grassroots levels and
improving development effectiveness-but with increased emphasis on growth and inclusion. The seven
broad strategic instruments associated with the PRS (see paragraph 40) are equally important in the
approach the Bank has emphasized. Furthermore, the spirit of focus on selective outcomes embodied in
the IAP is consistent with the outcomes-based approach that has been pursued in the Bank’s work
program in Nepal for the last two years.
49.
While it is easy to agree that the focus should be on development outcomes, it is not so easy to
define the Bank’s accountability for such outcomes, for in the end the Bank’s role is only to facilitate or
support the changes in a country. Thus, there is a danger that an attempt to hold staff ‘accountable’ for
outcomes will lead the Bank to select only outcomes that are nearly certain. Clearly, failing to support
riskier but more important outcomes would be a mistake. To resolve this tension, a structure has been
developed over the last two years and the same approach is envisioned for the future. Specifically,
0

An ‘outcome’ is a significant change that would be highly desirable and possible within the four-

year CAS horizon. For the immediate year ahead, a specific ‘milestone’-Le.,
achieving the four-year outcome-is defined;

key step toward

Each outcome is expected to have less than 100% probability of happening, even with best efforts
on the part of the Bank2’
0

The matrix of outcomes is seen as a ‘portfolio’ in its entirety-i.e., consisting of some highprobability, but relatively low-impact outcomes and some low-probability, but high-impact outcomes.
To avoid extremes, the portfolio of outcomes is constructed with an expected overall success rate of
around 65-70%;21
The matrix and annual milestones are updated each year, with some outcomes replaced-ither
through achievement or a change in strategic priorities-and new milestones defined;
Rather than holding staff accountable for achievement of specific outcomes, the Country Team is
collectively held accountable for the overall outcome of the portfolio;22and
20

In practice, the probabilities of 20, 40, 60 or 80% are assigned, recognizing the relatively crude nature of
the probability assessments.

21

This does not imply that for outcomes that are not fully achieved, there will be no progress. In many cases,
it is likely that some progress toward the ultimate outcome will have been made.

22

Unless an entirely unforeseen event changes the country setting profoundly, a significant shortfall in
reaching the expected rate of achievement would mean either: (i) the initial assessment or strategy was
unrealistic; or (ii) the Bank’s efforts were inadequate.

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

Page 19 of 34

The same approach is applied to a set of annual milestones as well, so that annual performance
can be monitored against some expected overall achievement rate.

50.
Based on this framework for work programming, this CAS has identified 15 PRS areas-out of
the 34 PRS areas-that are central to poverty reduction and are consistent with the Bank’s relative
strengths vis-a-vis Nepal’s other development partners. They spell out the broad ‘development results’ or
outcomes that the CAS will focus on. While the importance of these results are obvious, the CAS
timefi-ame is too short to set direct and measureable targets for them. Therefore, these 15 higher level
outcomes are translated into 26 intermediate outcomes--corresponding to the base case scenario
described in paragraph 64-that are specific and meaningful for the FY04-FY07 period. In a high case
scenaric-with acceleration of reforms-the matrix would likely be updated to include more outcomes.
These outcomes were selected based on four key criteria:

In each priority area, the outcome is representative of the broader change envisioned by the PRS.
Thus, it is not the only change expected. If this particular change is happening, many associated
changes are likely happening, thereby contributing to the larger PRS goals;
As much as possible, the outcomes should be linked to an action in the IAP to ensure high
priority accorded by HMGN;
0

In general, the outcome is clearly defined, measurable and feasible;23and
In applying the selectivity principle, the Bank has a comparative advantage in facilitating the
outcome and has a well-developed strategy to contribute materially to its realization.
0

5 1.
The outcomes matrix is organized around the four PRS pillars and presented in two parts. The 15
areas and 26 specific outcomes for the CAS period are displayed in Table 3. A more detailed matrix
(see Annex BlO) describes briefly, for each outcome, the Bank’s strategy for achieving it, annual
milestones, Bank instruments and key partners. Specific annual milestones for FY04 are provided for
each outcome with some additional milestones for subsequent years. As noted, these annual milestones
are updated each year, and as such, milestones for FY05, FY06 and FY07 should be seen more as
indicative. The more detailed matrix also links the CAS outcomes to specific country outcomes identified
in the PRS, showing the strong linkage between the Bank’s contributions and the country’s goals as
established in the PRS.24

Cross Cutting Themes
52.
Gender and Social Inclusion. For the successful implementation of this CAS, there are a
number of cross cutting themes-specifically, gender and social inclusion, fiduciary and environmental
policies, and capacity building-that deserve special mention. In rural areas, the women’s critical role as
economic providers-either through unpaid labor on the family farm or as wage workers for others-is
widely recognized. Indeed, the poorer the family, the greater its reliance on the skills and labor of female
family members for economic survival. While there is great variation in the gender systems of different
ethnic and caste groups in Nepal, all of them to some extent discriminate against women in terms of
access to property, investments in health and especially education, and in the degree to which women’s
voices are heard in community decision-making or national governance.
23

Certain outcomes are stated rather generally for lack of a better definition. In such cases, however, annual
milestones tend to be quite specific to help clarify the kind of change the CAS hopes to support.

24

In the PRS matrix in Annex B11, in addition to linking the CAS outcomes to the PRS outcomes, the
specific intermediate indicators/activities corresponding to each of the milestones are also highlighted.

53.
Gender is clearly one important dimension of social exclusion in Nepal, however, more
recently-especially in the years following the reinstitution of democracy-other dimensions of social
exclusion-namely caste and ethnicity-have come into greater prominence as indigenous groups
(Janajati) and formerly ‘low caste’ (Dalit) groups have been able to organize and speak out. In response
to this-and to the insurgents criticism that the Nepali state has largely been in the hands of males from
the dominant caste and ethnic groups-the PRS has recognized the disparities resulting from gender,
ethnicity and caste. To better understand the institutional underpinnings of caste, ethnic and gender-based
social and economic exclusion in Nepal and how these affect poverty outcomes-as well as the options
for policy and institutional reforms-a Social and Gender Analysis is currently being carried out and will
be completed in FY04. Furthermore, in all interventions-cspecially in the sector-wide approaches to be
employed in education, rural water supply and health-efforts will be made to ensure that social and
gender inclusion issues are explicitly recognized and receive close attention. To ensure that gender and

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

social aspects are fully integrated at both the project and policy level work of the Nepal program, in the
last year a Lead Social Scientist was posted in Kathmandu.”

54.
Fiduciary and Environmental Policies. Similarly, in implementing the CAS, ensuring
adherence to sound fiduciary and environmental policies will be crucial. As mentioned, a CPAR was
finalized in FYOl and a CFAA was completed in FY02 (see Appendix V), with IDF grants supporting
implementation of the key recommendations.26 While the legal and regulatory framework for ensuring
public sector financial accountability is impressive, implementation-including compliance with the
framework-is generally weak. In the area of procurement, very few countries today still follow the
system used by Nepal-under which public procurement is governed by a set of financial rules issued by
the Government-and hence, the major need is to enact a modern, transparent, and competitive publi
procurement law.
~

55.
Despite a rather comprehensive
framework for environmental protection, in
addition to weak capacity and poor
coordination, the main environmental
challenges in Nepal pertain to the
sustainable use of natural resources and
adequate integration of environmental
planning in development programs and their
implementation. In response, HMGN has
incorporated conservation activities in
selected sectoral plans and programs, while
environment-related provisions have been
incorporated in various acts (see Box 8).
Among the accomplishments: (i) the donorsupported Community Forest Program has
been successful in helping to reverse
deforestation in the hill regions; (ii)
endangered mammal species have been
recovered in the Terai; and (iii) careful
attention to designated conservation areas
supported by eco-tourism have had
important impacts on poor and remote rural
communities.
Beyond the five key
environmental issues-forest depletion, soil
degradation, solid waste management, water
quality and air pollution-a number of new
challenges have emerged, such as rapid but
uncontrolled and haphazard urbanization
(resulting partially from insecurity and
violence in rural areas), glacial lake outburst
floods,
arsenic
contamination
of
groundwater, indoor air pollution from

Box 8: The Response to Environmental Challenges
HMGN has responded to the environmental
challenges by incorporating conservation activities in
sectoral plans and programs. Furthermore, environmentrelated provisions have been incorporated in various acts
such as: (i) the Local Self-Governance Act (1998) that
specifies the role of DDCs and VDCs in environmental
planning, forest and biodiversity conservation, land-use
management, and public sanitation; (ii) the Forest Act
(1992), and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation
Act (1973 and amended in 1993) that provide for community
involvement in forest management and species conservation;
and (iii) the Environment Protection Act (1996) and the
Environment Protection Rules (1997) that contain provisions
for institutionalizing environmental impact assessment and
expanding pollution control activities. In addition, a National
Environmental Policy and Action Plan was prepared (1993)
to help implement Agenda 21 of the Rio Earth Summit; an
Environment Protection Council was constituted as a policy
advisory body (1992); and a Ministry of Population and
Environment (MoPE) was established (1995). Nepal is a
party to 16 environment-related international Conventions
and Agreements, including CITES and ITTA.
Despite these efforts to address environmental
management, weak institutional capacity and poor
coordination between MoPE and sectoral agencies has
constrained the implementation of environmental policies
and programs. There is also a significant gap between the
content of the international environmental conventions and
their implementation at the national level. There are many
donors ( e g , Denmark, Germany, UNDP, UNEP) and
international (e.g., WWF, IUCN) and national (e.g., King
Mahendra Trust for Conservation of Nature) NGOs active in
the environmental arena and funding is not a constraint.

25

This has been made possible in part through the generous support of the United Kingdom’s Department for
International Development (Dff D).

26

It is important to note, however, that the team looks at fiduciary issues in a much broader context than that
covered by the CFAA. See Box 9 for details.

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

biomass burning and food contamination. With the large donor and NGO presence, Bank involvement in
the environmental agenda will be selective and focus on helping HMGN articulate an effective strategy
for environmental conservation and management and capacity building. Accordingly, a Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA) is planned for FY05. Using this as a basis, we would focus on possible
outcomes for Bank support and then determine appropriate instruments. Given Nepal’s biological
diversity, however, there are possibilities for use of funds from the Global Environmental Facility
(GEF)-e.g., support to sustainable gathering, processing and marketing of high value plants and herbs,
micro-hydropower, or remediation of glacial lake outburst floods. There are also good prospects for
implementation of programs supported by the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) and the Community Carbon
Fund (CCF)
Capacity Building. As institutional weaknesses and lack of capacity are well-recognized
56.
constraints, an important cross cutting theme of the CAS is capacity building. According to some
estimates, over US$lOO million per year is spent by donor agencies and INGOs in Nepal on what can be
broadly termed ‘capacity building’ activities. The outcome is clearly very disappointing, and both
HMGN and donors agree that a serious rethinking is in order. There is, however, an entrenched thinking
to equate provision of consultants and training with capacity building, which in part explains the
continued attempt to ‘throw money’ at the capacity building challenge.

57.
A strong public sector institution requires: (i) sound institutional set-up; (ii) ‘enabling
environment’ for the institution-especially a system that shields the institution from undue political
interference and rewards professional performance; (iii) good people-which requires a performanceoriented and financially decent incentive system as well as training; and (iv) experience. In Nepal,
development partners have tended mainly to focus on institutional set-up and training people, without
paying sufficient attention to the other aspects or finding effective ways to get at them. Improving the
‘enabling environment’ and creating a performance-oriented incentive system are inherently political
processes, and donors can only encourage indigenous efforts. Thus, donor support needs to be somewhat
opportunistic. An important dimension that has tended to be neglected by donors is helping the
institutions to build experience. If anything, by substituting for HMGN’s own work, development
partners may have tended to hamper the ability of Nepali institutions to strengthen through experience.
The Bank’s knowledge in supporting key reform initiatives indicates that capacity building is more about
creating space for the Nepalis to think for themselves and act on their own, and providing knowledge only
where it is specifically demanded.27 Money is seldom the real constraint to capacity building in Nepal.
Based on this perspective, the Bank’s efforts will focus on:
0
Facilitating country-led changes, as in the end this is what capacity building is about. The
primary concentration will be on helping HMGN build its own policy formulation and
implementation capacity at the central level through experience. This effort depends critically on the
ability of the country-based staff--especially Nepali staff-to
engage and motivate HMGN
counterparts in reform thinking, backed by the ability to bring in global knowledge from the rest of
the Bank and/or internationally as needed. While this concept of decentralization is already working
well, further efforts will be made, especially to strengthen the capacity of the country-based staff; and
0
Where there are legitimate needs for more traditional TA and training that arise from the Nepalled and Bank-supported reform efforts, the Bank will continue to be prepared to provide such
assistance through a variety of means. Since all IDA-funded projects involve important reform
elements, almost all include TA and/or training components. To maximize their impact, however, the
Bank relies heavily on identification of needs by the reform leaders themselves. In some areas-such

21

Good examples of this are the experience with the introduction of MTEF and development of IAP as noted
in noted in paragraph 43.

as public expenditure management, monitoring and evaluation in conjunction with PRS
implementation, and improving financial accountability systems-TA and training of central
importance will be supported by IDF grants and direct TA.
Instruments to Achieve the CAS Outcomes
58.
A critical element for achieving the CAS outcomes is an internal alignment of the work program
with the outcomes. The formulation of the annual work program is used as an important process to
develop a consensus on the annual milestones toward achieving the longer term CAS outcomes, and the
broad strategy and specific instruments to reach those milestones. This has helped to develop organic
integration of a range of AAA instruments (e.g., formal reports, informal policy notes, TA, seminars,
policy dialogue, strategic communication) and lending instruments. It has also enabled much more
effective cross-sectoral efforts directed toward the shared outcomes. This process, combined with regular
monitoring of progress from the outcomes perspective, is the cornerstone of the outcomes-based
approach.

59.
In relation to many outcomes, AAA will continue to play an important role and will be used more
consciously to overcome specific obstacles to reforms. During the past four years, while the lending
program remained in the low case and the work program focused on motivating reforms, the Bank learned
to use AAA more strategically for engaging Nepali authorities in policy dialogue and has been effective
in evoking change. The shift by the Bank toward an outcomes-focused approach also changed the nature
of AAA. From the outset, each AAA piece is conceived as part of a strategy to help facilitate some
specific development outcome. This has led to two important changes: (i) unlike in the past,
dissemination of AAA outputs is no longer an afterthought, but is an integral part of the motivation for
the AAA task itself; and (ii) there is much greater use of small, informal, and targeted reports that are
designed to help the reform leaders in Nepal

as well as continuous public expenditure analysis.

6 1.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) will both play important-albeit relatively limited-roles in the implementation of the
strategy. IFC will continue to support export-oriented manufacturing, private investment in
telecommunications and power generation and distribution, financial market development, and the growth
of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due to the still weak security situation and political
uncertainties, currently there are few investment opportunities in Nepal large enough for direct financing,
so IFC does not expect to make many new investments during the CAS period. Instead, IFC will focus on
technical assistance for SMEs through the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) based in
Dhaka. This facility-funded by IFC in partnership with Canada, Netherlands, Norway, the UK, Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union (EU)-will deliver programs in Nepal to increase
access for SMEs to financing and business development services, improve the business environment for
SMEs and develop linkages with larger enterprises. SEDF will closely coordinate with the Bank’s efforts
in the financial sector to provide TA and training to banks, including introducing best practices and new
products for SME lending. SEDF will also work with selected business associations in the agribusiness
and tourism sectors. SEDF intends to locate a staff member within the Kathmandu office to manage these
programs. Over the upcoming CAS period, MIGA will continue to support suitable foreign direct
investments into Nepal as they present themselves.
Bank Group Scenarios
62.
Given the current rather significant political uncertainties, the CAS must be able to respond
constructively to a wide range of possible eventualities. Without a doubt, the greatest source of
uncertainty is the insurgency. If a peace settlement is reached, there will likely be a need for a large scale
‘nation re-building’ program and the Bank would be expected to be part of ita3’ On the other hand,
renewed hostilities could turn more intense and severely curtail the ability of HMGN to implement the
PRS. In either of these extremes or in between, the nature of the reforms envisioned in the PRS will
remain relevant. Therefore, it is useful to think of the following three scenarios that naturally correspond
to the standard CAS scenarios:
0
Base (‘central’) case-in which the hostilities are limited or not severe enough to interfere
seriously with development work and the current reforms continue to move forward;
0
Low c a s e i n which renewed hostilities hamper implementation of the PRS-thus, reducing the
external funding needs-or the reform efforts themselves become stalled-thus, making it difficult to
justify high levels of IDA funding; and

High case-in
which it is assumed that a peace agreement is reached and/or the reforms
accelerate, thereby creating both a need and environment for larger aid flows.
0

29

This will follow up on Understanding Children’s Work in Nepal (March 2003). This study-carried out
jointly with ILO and UNICEF-includes a set of recommendations and proposed policy actions that will
help formulate a more comprehensive framework for handling issues associated with child labor.

30

Purposely, the word ‘reconstruction’ is avoided, as the reconstruction needs are llkely to be modest given
that conflict-affected areas tend to suffer from under-investment. Instead, what is required is a major effort
to upgrade mfrastructure and social services in these regions that have long been under-served.

64.
A notional base case lending scenario is presented in Table 6 in which the IDA lending program
would average about US$190 million per year, consistent with Nepal’s current IDA all~cation.~’
In each
year, the lending program would be anchored in a PRSC providing programmatic support to the
implementation of the PRS/IAP (see Box 9). The first PRSC aims to: (i) support Nepal’s reform
champions in implementing far-reaching reforms that revive growth, improve service delivery, promote
social inclusion and improve governance; and (ii) contribute to maintaining a sound macro framework
and in protecting high priority anti-poverty programs by filling part of Nepal’s financing gap. Future
PRSCs will focus on key elements that are critical to achieve the CAS outcomes. In the broad-based
growth pillar, these include: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) labor market; (iii) infrastructure (e.g.,
the main road network and rural roads); and (iv) financial sector reform. In social sector development and
inclusion, the focus will be on improving service delivery-in education, health and waterhanitation-in
addition to implementing targeted programs for excluded groups. Finally, in governance the focus will be
on public/civil service reform as well as re-activating and strengthening the decentralization process.

31

As indicated, the outcomes in Table 3 are those explicitly lmked to the base case scenario and in a high
case scenario there would likely be more outcomes.

32

While the base case envisages an average annual lending program of about US$l90 million, there is some
uncertainty associated with the ability of HMGN to implement projects under different security and
political situations. As such, a realistic range-US$l20-200 million-has been established.

Nepal Countiy Assistance Strategy

65.
In each year, the PRSC would be
complemented by three or four investment
or sectoral operations to support key
programs in the focus areas.
With
increasing emphasis on growth, the lending
program will continue to focus on
infrastructure investment. Since the existing
portfolio already has a strong tilt toward
infrastructure, the base case lending
program does not show large new
infrastructure projects. In part, this also
recognizes the difficulty of implementing
large-scale projects during a conflict.
Nevertheless, if the opportunities arise,
financial support for infrastructure can be
readily increased through both the PRSC
and, in case of peace, additional investment
operations. The necessary technical work
has been built into the base case program.

Given its low income level, it is
assumed that Nepal will continue to receive
a portion of its IDA allocation in the form of
grants at least for a part of the CAS period.33 HMGN has expressed a preference to use IDA grant
financing for: (i) key priorities in the social sectors (including for PAF), and (ii) for technical a ~ s i s t a n c e . ~ ~
Although the base case lending program represents a significant increase in the level of IDA lending to
Nepal (the base case was US$70-120 million under the 1998 CAS), this should not pose any debt service
difficulties. With a highly concessional debt structure, the public debt service to GDP ratio stands at a
modest 1.6% and external debt servicing is only about 7.5% of exports of goods and non-factor services.35
67.
In a low case scenario, the lending volume would be significantly less than in a base case-Le.,
averaging US$O-50 million per year. The nature of IDA assistance in the low case would depend on its
circumstance. If the cause is renewed hostilities-and the consequent narrowing of the reach of
HMGN-then it would be appropriate to cut back on investment operations to account for the reduced
physical scope of reform implementation. On the other hand, if the cause is slow implementation of the
reforms, then the focus of lending activities would revert back to supporting decentralization and
community-based projects (which would likely lay the foundation for better governance dynamics in the
future) and whatever specific reforms that nonetheless managed to proceed at the central level.

33

Availability of IDA grants in FY06-FY07 will depend on the outcome of the IDA14 replenishment
deliberations.

34

This is consistent with HMGN’s Foreign Aid Policy (FAP) that states “technical assistance for project
design, institutional and capacity building, technical backstopping, and project monitoring and review are
more suitable for grant financing than for concessional loans.”

35

Nepal is a ‘less indebted low-income’ country with a ratio of external debt to GDP of 53% and a total
public debt to GDP ratio of 70% (end FY01/02). IMF simulations suggest that if key variables remained at
their average value of the last ten years, the total debt to GDP ratio would decline to 53% in FY06107.

to reform acceleration, the high case

deepening implementation of the IAP

Box 9: Financial Management Broadly Defined

When evaluating whether a country is considered ‘ready’ for
programmatic support, it is common to evaluate its financial
management capacity. Financial management, however, should
not be equated with narrow matters of financial rules and
regulations. But, it is fundamentally concerned with effective use
of fmancial resources. First, therefore, fmancial management is
about good resource allocation. Through the MTEF, HMGN’s
resource allocations have improved considerably over the last
two years, eliminating much of the fat, imposing a fm budget
ceiling and prioritizing development expenditures. Second,
financial management is about improving service delivery
modalities. Through many programs initiated during the last two
years-e.g., transferring management of schools and sub-health
posts to local communities-HMGN
has demonstrated
commitment to improving service delivery. Finally, at the next
level, financial management is about providing decision-makers
with sufficient, accurate and timely financial information to
evaluate: (i) overall public sector financial management
performance; (ii) stewardship of resources placed under public
sector control; and (iii) the extent to which resources are used in
accordance with prescribed budgets and mandates. Although
admittedly further strengthening is required, there are serious
programs under way-e.g.,
implementing the CFAA
recommendations, capacity building for accounting and auditing
staff, and increased monitoring of financial and physical
progress. Therefore, when looking more broadly at financial
management, Nepal has come a long way and has fully
demonstrated its seriousness to tackle the right issues.

Portfolio Management

IDA
69.
The operating environment in Nepal has been characterized by weak public management, a low
skills base, political instability and the aftermath of an armed insurgency that has affected a majority of
the country’s 75 districts. Despite these heavy odds, project implementation performance and outcomes
have improved in the last five years. On many accounts-satisfactory outcomes, project sustainability
and institutional development-performance of the Nepal portfolio substantially improved and compares
favorably to both the region and Bank (see Table 7 ) . As such, overall the Bank’s contribution to
development in Nepal in the last five years can no longer be considered as “unsatisfactory in outcomes,
modest with respect to institutional development impact and highly uncertain in terms of sustainability”
as summarized in the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED).36 Furthermore, more recently there has been greater borrower commitment as shown by adequate
levels of counterpart funding and efforts to improve project staffing and management. While in the past
project implementation has suffered from political interference-in part seen through frequent staff
transfers-the dedication and commitment of reform-minded senior civil servants and project staff have
helped to achieve the improved outcomes. Perceived or real corruption and lack of accountability in
public institutions remain a drag on project performance, but recent actions by the public sector to rectify
these ills should help to improve accountability and strengthen governance.

Following the implementation of Portfolio Implementation Plans (PIPS) in FY99 and FYO037which included actions to improve the performance of individual projects, as well as specific measures to
address generic issues-there was a remarkable improvement in the status of the Nepal portfolio, with
projects at risk dropping to 13% of the portfolio. This was not to last, however, as the declaration of a
national emergency in November 2001 resulted in an escalation of violence and impaired security. This
affected much of the portfolie-especially in the remote and less developed mid- and far-western
regions-with IDA unable to carry out adequate supervision and project activities slowing or even
coming to a halt in some instances under force majeure. By January 2003, 43% of the projects and over
70% of IDA commitments were considered at risk, but following the cessation of hostilities, there had
been a steady improvement and by end-FY03, the portfolio risks have been reduced to more manageable
levels (see Annex B2). The Bank shares the experience with other donors that truly community-owned
projects tend to be largely unaffected by the insurgency.

71.
The current IDA portfolio in Nepal consists of nine active projects, of which five are due to close
in the next eighteen months (see Table 8). Active operations as of September 15, 2003 represented an

The FY98 Annual Report on Portfolio Performance identified Nepal as a priority PIP country-i.e., a
country with more than 50% of the portfolio andior more than 33% of commitments at risk, with more than
eight active projects andor US$250 million in commitments.

aggregate IDA commitment of about US$298 million (net of cancellations), of which US$167 million
remains undisbursed. The portfolio declined from fourteen projects in FY98 to eight projects in
FYOUFY02 as a result of the low lending levels since FY99, closing of aging projects and a deliberate
policy to ensure adequate quality at entry. With the move to the base case in December 2002, the
portfolio has increased slightly.
72.
Despite the noted improvements, the portfolio remains at risk and could be adversely affected by
a resumption of insurgent activities or a period of protracted political instability. To mitigate the risks,
the Bank-primarily through the staff in the country office-has been proactively supporting and
monitoring project implementation. In this effort, the Bank, together with HMGN, ADB and the Japan
Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) have been carrying out joint Nepal Portfolio Performance
Reviews (NPPRs) since 2000. The main objective of these reviews is to discuss generic issues affecting
portfolio management-such as security, passage of laws and regulations, procurement, financial
management and safeguards-and agree on time-bound action plans to resolve the identified issues. A
memorandum of understanding is signed by all parties and the actions are closely monitored and reviewed
semi-annually. The most recent review was conducted in October 2002, with a mid-term review taking
place in May 2003.38 These joint reviews are complemented by quarterly reviews of the implementation
progress of IDA projects, along with close supervision and monitoring with frequent site visits. In
addition to placing emphasis on quality at entry and quality of supervision, Bank staff are active in
identifying and resolving potential issues before they become problems.
73.
A number of initiatives-i.e., the preparation of the CPAR, the CFAA and Public Works
Directives with ADB assistance-have
provided a sound framework for addressing generic
implementation issues and improving the general operating environment. Special committees have been
established to implement the CPAR and CFAA recommendations, and are expected to modernize, as well
as simplify and streamline, the public procurement and financial accountability regimes, resulting in a
higher level of transparency in public procurement and enhanced accountability in financial transactions.
Portfolio Performance is expected to improve further with the implementation of performance-based
budget allocations and fund releases under the MTEF, and systematic project and program monitoring by
sector agencies and the NF’C. There is an increasing awareness to strengthen environmental and social
safeguards in all public investments, but as indicated, implementation remains weak and will require
continued support.

IFC
74.
IFC’s current held exposure in Nepal is US$79.9 million-US$53.0 million from IFC’s own
account and US$26.9 million in B loans-in four projects, of which two are in private power generation,
one in tourism and one in leasing. The investment in the tourism sector was restructured as the
performance of the company suffered due to the political instability and insurgency. The remaining
portfolio is in good condition, with a loss reserve ratio of only 4% of total exposure.
MIGA

To date, MIGA has facilitated estimated foreign direct investment into Nepal in the amount of
US$122.4 million. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in the country consists of four contracts of guarantee

The mid-term review acknowledged progress and achievements since the NPPR, noting that the reforms
have had a positive impact on portfolio performance. However, a number of generic issues-including
effectiveness delays, poor quality of civil works, financial management, and cost and time over-runs-were
noted as requiring priority action. The 2003 NPPR will be carried out in November.

IMPLEMENTING THE CAS

Partnerships

76.
As strengthened through the consultation
process (see Box lo), effective partnerships with
Nepal’s other development partners will be
essential in CAS implementation. Partnerships
will be maintaineddeveloped in the context of
HMGN’s leadership of donor coordination
efforts3’, respecting the Foreign Aid Policy
(FAP).40There are three types of partnerships that
will be important: (i) official partnerships; (ii)
partnerships with the private sector; and (iii)
partnerships with civil society. The Bank will
continue to work closely with key multi-lateral
and bi-lateral partners with whom there are many
examples of strong, effective coordination efforts,
including:
0
The Reform and Development GroupHMGN and seven donors that are prepared in
principle to consider programmatic-type
assistance to Nepal (ADB, Denmark, IMF,
Japan, Norway, UK and the Bank)-has been
supporting development, implementation and
monitoring of the IAF’.

Box 10: The CAS Consultation Process
As noted (see Box 6), Nepal’s PRS was prepared
through a very consultative process. As such, the
overwhelming focus of the CAS consultations has
been on aligning donor support around the PRS with
emphasis on: (i) discussing the Bank’s proposed
strategy and its relationship to the PRS to ensure that
in the aggregate, donor support is adequate to cover
implementation of key PRS programs; and (ii)
identifying specific areas of collaboration. The Bank
has worked closely with DfID-which is preparing an
outcomes-focused Country Assistance Plan (CAP)including holding a one-day joint workshop in
Kathmandu to discuss ways to support PRS
implementation effectively. Taking the collaboration
with DfID to a new level of closeness, DfID and the
Bank have agreed on a set of PRS-based outcomes as
the common goals for DfID’s new CAP and the
Bank’s new CAS. In addition, small focus groupswith representatives of HMGN, NGOs and civil
society-have been convened along the way to
discuss various CAS drafts. To be most effective in
assisting HMGN implement the PRS, consultation
with Nepal’s other development partners will be a
continuous process throughout the CAS lifetime.

0
Significant sectoral collaborations have taken place in: (i) the financial sector reform efforts with
coordination between the Bank, IMF4’ and DfID; (ii) the power sector where the Bank, UNDP,
Germany, US and Norway are collaborating in several areas, including the PDF and development of
micro-hydro systems in rural areas; and (iii) the education sector in which a number of donors-

39

In May 2003, the local donor coordination group agreed to break from the tradition of having the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bank as co-chairs and invited HMGN to chair the
group.

40

HMGN has made impressive efforts in the preparation and initial implementation of the FAP that outlines
objectives, guidelines, strategies and policies aimed at guiding the flow and composition of foreign aid to
ensure better aid utilization.

41

Board presentation of the IMF PRGF is anticipated for mid-November. Overall, IMF-Bank collaboration
has been excellent. The proposed PRSC I has been prepared in parallel with the PRGF and the two
institutions are working closely to ensure that the programs relnforce each other. For more information on
the IMF program in Nepal, see Appendix IV.

As mentioned (see paragraph 72), for a few years the Bank together with HMGN, ADB and JBIC
have been carrying out joint implementation performance reviews.

77.
In line with the PRS philosophy, various sectoral ministries-e.g., education and health-are
talung a proactive leadership role in the coordination of programs supported by development partners.
While a shift of this nature takes time, Bank assistance and the deployment of programmatic support
instruments in particular will provide leverage to Nepali reformers to expand and accelerate this process.
Where cross-cutting interventions are critical (e.g., in HIV/AIDS) the Bank will work with other
development partners to improve the framework for inter-agency collaboration and coordination. An
important part of the coordination effort revolves around selectivity in implementing the PRS and
ensuring that the key PRS programs can be implemented. The multi-lateral and bi-lateral partnerships for
implementing the PRS are summarized in Table 9.

Similar joint support is being developed to assist implementation of the Health Sector Strategy. The
Ministry of Health has established a Health Sector Reform Committee to lead the reform process, including
key donors (Germany, IDA, Japan, UNFPA, UNICEF, UK, US and WHO), NGOs, and the private sector.

78.
Through two participatory NDFs (2000 and 2002) and the PRS, HMGN has come to engage civil
society and the private sector more effectively in policy dialogue. Also, in Bank-financed projects,
HMGN has shown greater willingness to benefit from partnerships with NGOs and CBOs, in particular
those that involve community mobilization, service delivery and monitoring in remote rural areas. The
Bank will continue to encouraged these efforts. In addition to policy dialogue, partnerships among
HMGN, the private sector and the Bank will remain central to the efficient provision and expansion of
basic infrastructure services, particularly in power and telecommunications. The Bank Group’s capacity
to work with the private sector will be enhanced with the introduction of the SEDF (see paragraph 61).
Partnerships in capacity building will also be strengthened with institutions key to development
effectiveness, such as local bodies and media. As with official partnerships, the Bank’s dialogue and
coordination with the private sector and civil society will be guided by principles established in the PRS
with a view towards strengthening national ownership of the development agenda.
79.
Helping to reinforce these partnerships, the Bank will continue to communicate its development
support to Nepal through outreach mechanisms already in place-e.g., the Nepal website, and regular
consultative and dissemination events-as well as partnerships with the media. A Public Information
Center (PIC)---cun-ently located in the country office-will be built up and moved to a publicly
accessible location and managed in collaboration with an external partner. The Bank will also work
closely with other donors to support HMGN in the delivery of a strategic communication program built
around the Tenth PladPRS.

B.

Monitoring Outcomes

80.
Given that the CAS supports implementation of the PRS and CAS outcomes are closely aligned
with PRS outcomes, effective monitoring will only be possible if HMGN’s monitoring and evaluation
capacity is enhanced. Therefore, much of the Bank’s efforts will be through capacity building to help
establish an in-country monitoring and evaluation capacity. HMGN’s past efforts have been limited
largely to expenditure monitoring, with few linkages to outputs and service delivery. Although reviews
were held every two months within the Ministerial Development Action Committee and quarterly at the
National Development Committee (NDC-chaired by the Prime Minister), a fundamental focus on
achieving development outcomes was lacking. To redress these weaknesses, since the beginning of
FY02/03 several initiatives have been started by HMGN to monitor both financial and physical progress,
including: (i) publishing on the internet detailed work programs with monitorable output indicators for all
P1 projects; (ii) releasing hnds based on satisfactory implementation performance, as certified by the line
mini~tries;~~
and (iii) regular reporting-through the mid-term budget review and other means-of
expenditure performance of P1 projects to the NPC and MOF. Though there have been some delays, the
system has proven effective, especially in the scarce cash budget management environment. Another new
initiative has been the monitoring of IAP activities that has led to satisfactory completion of the IAP
activities and has embedded a culture of joint monitoring/partnership among core ministries.
8 1.
Cognizant of the need to align and strengthen HMGN’s integrated financial management system
with public sector monitoring and evaluation to effectively implement and assess the country’s progress
in achieving the annual PRS targets towards the MDGs: (i) a Central Monitoring Division has been
established within the Poverty Monitoring Unit at the NPC; and (ii) the Central Bureau of Statistics has
been entrusted with gathering survey data for poverty monitoring. HMGN has prepared a povertymonitoring framework, initiated streamlining of the existing surveys to be linked to PRS monitoring and
identified preliminary indicators under each of the four PRS pillars. Though these indicators are by no
means complete, efforts are under way to: (i) develop intermediate indicators; (ii) identify appropriate
43

Performance is assessed every three months. Upon announcement of the cease-fire, this rule was relaxed to
expedite resource flow to insurgency-affected areas where project activities had been severely affected.

surveys and frequencies to monitor these indicators; (iii) institutionalize IAP reporting; (iv) strengthen the
link between the fund release mechanism and measurable outcomes; (v) initiate a poverty mapping
exercise to direct basic social sector infrastructure to the poor and marginalized groups; and (vi) extend
expenditure tracking and client surveys through participatory monitoring exercises on specific areas and
sectors. Under the direction of the Vice Chairman of the NPC, the Poverty Monitoring Unit will prepare
annual poverty reports-the country report on progress towards the MDGs-to be reviewed by NDC.44
The Bank is working closely with HMGN to develop this capacity and at the same time, will take
advantage of these efforts to ensure that all CAS outcomes can be measured and regularly evaluated.
C.

Risks

82.
The most important risk that Nepal faces today is one of the country spiraling into a widespread
armed conflict and a breakdown of state institutions. By extension, this is the gravest risk the Bank
should be concerned with. The current reform process has in fact emerged as an antidote against the risk
of widespread internal conflict and the breakdown of the development process. Hence, supporting it must
be at the core of the Bank’s own risk management strategy. Nevertheless, at the next tier of the risk
structure, it is useful to consider various risks to the reform process itself, so that the Bank is wellprepared to support the reform process under different circumstances. The fragile security situation and
political turmoil present obvious uncertainties. At a deeper level, however, there are two types of
blockages that may arise: (i) the possibility that the reform process itself is stymied or reversed; and (ii)
the possibility that capacity to implement the reforms-even if commitment is sustained-becomes
seriously curtailed.
83.
While the major political parties and political leaders have tacitly supported the current reform
process, the risk of their undermining the reform efforts out of short term political considerations cannot
be discounted and would be consistent with the politics of Nepal in the past. If the peace process
advances, there is also a risk that some of the more control-oriented economic policy agenda and
unrealistic elements of welfare state agenda of the insurgents (e.g., restrictive trade policies, stopping
privatization of SOEs, ban on private schools, free social services) may influence the reform program.
When the more technocratic interim Governments make way for an elected Government, there is a risk of
old-style patronage politics returning and with it tendencies for rent-seeking, slowing of reforms and
crowding out of the reform-minded senior civil service leaders.
84.
The reform leaders are acutely aware of these risks and believe that the best safeguard is the
broad popular support for the reforms. By giving the people and communities more power and immediate
benefits, they can expand the political constituency for reforms. This thinking is clearly reflected in the
2003 IAP which places a strong emphasis on service delivery. In the medium term, as the broader PRS is
implemented, the Nepali people at large should begin to expect good public service delivery and public
policies, rather than more personal gains, from the political process. Such a change could eventually
transform the patronage-based politics of the past into a democracy that focuses on public interests. In
this regard, the basic strategy of the Bank is to support the reformers to accelerate the reform process.
Close coordination among the development partners to send consistent messages is a key element of the
Bank’s strategy. An added risk mitigation measure is the starkly differential lending scenarios-Le., the
difference between the low and the high case is potentially US$250 million per year-that continue to
send a strong message that the Bank’s financial support is linked to continued reform implementation.
85.
The second risk is mainly associated with renewed and escalated hostilities that would sharply
reduce HMGN’s ability to implement the programs envisioned by the PRS. While it would make the
reform process more difficult in the conflict-affected areas, it may well stiffen the resolve of the reform
44

Utilizing available information, the first such report has already been issued.

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

Page 34 of 34

leaders to accelerate reform implementation in the rest of the country. In such a situation, continued
support by the Bank would no doubt give considerable encouragement to HMGN to carry forward the
reform process. Renewed and severe hostilities would also pose a fiscal challenge. Security spending
would rise and revenues would suffer fkom further slowing in economic activities. Although the rise in
security spending would be in part offset by slowing development activities, the net impact on HMGN’s
fiscal position would likely be significantly negative. HMGN has already positioned itself to cope with
such a situation in an orderly manner based on its prioritized development program. Aware that this is the
only way to counter the fiscal problems, the reformers-as in the last two years or so--may also use the
fiscal pressure and the need to obtain budget support from the Bank and other development partners as a
tool to further rationalize spending and accelerate reforms.

86.
A political impasse has developed between the major political parties and the interim
Governments (and by association, the King who appointed them). Although the increasingly belligerent
attitude of the major political parties has dismayed many Nepalis, there is a risk that this will lead to
wide-spread civil disorder and distract the administration. In such a situation, even the reform-minded
technocrats would find it difficult to get cabinet decisions on further reforms and to keep the civil service
focused on improving public services. The Bank can do little to mitigate such a risk, but it will monitor
the situation closely.
87.
Lastly, an additional risk is that the economic situation will continue to deteriorate and Nepal will
be even more vulnerable to the external environment. Given Nepal’s dependence on tourism and exports,
unless there is a recovery in the global and domestic economic situations, Nepal’s medium term prospects
remain bleak. Again, implementing the reform agenda-specifically
maintaining fiscal and
macroeconomic stability, and increasing economic productivity and competitiveness-provides the best
chances for mitigating this risk.
88.
The challenges Nepal faces in taking the reform process forward are formidable. The cost of a
failure, however, is nothing short of widespread internal conflict, likely resulting in the breakdown of the
development process. The current reform leaders are very conscious of the risks and the high stakes. In
essence, implementing reforms with more speed and vigor is their strategy to reduce the risk of reversal,
and ultimately achieve peace and poverty reduction. Supporting this process is the core of the Bank’s
own strategy and risk mitigation. This is consistent with the basic strategy that the Bank has followed
over the last several years-support reform actions consistently and forcefully.

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned
A.

Background

As indicated, the last CAS for Nepal was discussed by the Board of Directors on December 13,
1998. Although outcomes to be achieved during the CAS period were not explicitly elaborated, the
triggers for the base case scenario provide useful insights on the main outcomes the Bank intended to
influence through the CAS interventions, specifically:
(i) at the lower end-of the base case scenario-stabilization of the situation and no further deterioration
in economic and administrative management, characterized by:
(a) Domestic revenues as a share of GDP remaining at or above 11%, domestic borrowing below
2% of GDP, and satisfactory implementation of VAT; and
Improved
management of public expenditures, with no further increase in the number of
(b)
projects in the public investment program, and adequate funding for donor-assisted and other
priority projects.
(ii) beyond stabilization-Le., within a more solid base case scenariewith a modest, but clear reform
effort, as reflected in the following types of steps:
(a) Tangible progress in decentralization and local self-government, with greater local involvement
in the management of development programs;
(b) Action on improving central government administrative performance, such as stricter
enforcement of rotation rules;
(c) Privatization of three public enterprises, and improvement of the efficiency and transparency of
privatization procedures and decision-making processes;
(d) Introduction of a three-year rolling investment program, and full funding of core programs and
projects;
(e) Progress in restructuring RBB and preparing its divestiture, completing the privatization of
NBL, improving banking regulations and improving NRB’s supervisory and regulatory
capacity;
(f) Progress in telecommunications reform, including introduction of competition; and
(8) Introduction of new measures to reduce corruption.
An appropriate mix of Bank interventions-both
assist Nepal in achieving these outcomes.

Achievements during the CAS period

Background
For four years-until December 2002-given the limited and slow progress in implementing
reforms, Nepal remained in a low case scenario. Given the fungibility of aid resources, without
substantial improvements in public expenditure management and public service delivery, more financial
assistance from IDA would not have been a solution to Nepal’s problems. HMGN clearly began
recognizing poor governance-reflected most acutely in weak implementation of reforms, poor service
delivery and corruption-as a central obstacle to development (see Box 1). Growing recognition of the
gravity of the financial sector conditions and the direct link to the system of poor governance-

first phase are to develop institutional capacity for qualitative and quantitative improvements in primary
education. Through the project, a number of donors-including IDA, Denmark, the European Union,
Finland, Norway, Japan, UNICEF and the ADB-are providing joint support to a well-formulated tenyear sectoral program;
The Rural Infrastructure Project (Cr. 3215-NEP) was approved in May 1999 (US$5 million) to
strengthen the institutional capacity of a decentralized governance system in its planning and managing
capabilities to improve the quality, efficiency and sustainability of rural roads with active participation of
project beneficiaries, Given limited Bank experience implementing community-based road projects in
Nepal, a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) was selected as the appropriate vehicle to test this
fundamental shift in approach. Through this project a number of decentralization options are being
tested, including working: (i) directly with the DDCs; (ii) with DDCs through contractors; (iii) with
CBOs; and (iv) through NGOs. The many implementation challenges associated with this project have
made it a learning experience for all involved. Nevertheless, recent results are promising as confidence
and experience are being accumulated to work more effectively at grassroots levels;
The objective of the Road Maintenance and Development Project (Cr. 3293-NEP)-approved
in November 1999 (US$54.5 million)-is to help achieve sustainable maintenance, rehabilitation and
construction of an economicallyjustifiable strategic road network, while also promoting more sustainable
funding and efficient public sector management of road maintenance. The project supports key sectoral

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned

policy reforms by establishing a Roads Board and Road Fund to assure a stable source of funding for
maintenance expenditures, while at the same time providing motorable access to isolated districts in the
mid- and far-west regions of the country (the heart of the insurgency area); and
The Telecommunications Sector Reform Project (Cr. 358 1-NEP) was approved in December
2001 (US$22.6 million) and supports on-going sectoral reforms and increasing rural access to
telecommunications services through the licensing of a private operator (selected on a competitive basis)
and establishing public telecommunications centers.
Following the move to the base case scenario in December 2002, three additional projects have
been approved for a total of US$96.9 million, specifically:
The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 3227-NEP) was approved in December
2002 (US$16.0 million) and supports the efforts of HMGN to improve the financial sector in order to
bring macroeconomic stability and promote private sector-led economic growth. The project focuses on
three major objectives: (i) helping to restructure and re-engineer the Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank,
NRB) so that it can effectively perform its key central banking functions; (ii) initiating commercial
banlung reform in the two large ailing commercial banks that dominate the sector-Rastriya Banijya
Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NIL)-by introducing stronger bank management that protects
their financial integrity; and (iii) supporting a better environment for financial sector reforms in areas
such as enhanced credit information, better financial news reporting, and better training for staff in
financial institutions;
The Power Development Project (Cr. 3293-NEP) was approved in May 2003 (US$50.4 million
IDA Credit and US$25.2 million IDA Grant) to help: (i) develop Nepal’s hydropower potential in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner so as to help meet electricity demand; (ii) improve
access of rural areas to electricity services and (iii) promote private sector participation in the power
sector as a way to improve sector efficiency and to mobilize financing for the sector’s investment
requirements. In early-FY04, the potential for a parallel Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
operation-to possibly include contingency financing for pipeline development of small and micro hydro
projects, and support for institutional development to facilitate private sector delivery of energy efficiency
services-will be assessed, with a possible operation coming later on; and
Another LE-the Community School Support Project (Cr. 3808-NEP)-was approved in June
2003 (US$5 million) to support the devolution of the responsibility for management of schools to
communities. The project provides support for school grants, scholarships, capacity building, and
monitoring and evaluation. The lessons learned from this project will help IDA (together with HMGN
and the other education development partners) design further phases of BPEP.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). Consistent with the low case scenario, strong
emphasis was placed on helping to build the agenda and needed consensus for reform. To a large extent,
the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Immediate Action Plan
(IAP)have been prompted by the Bank’s dialogue with HMGN. The Public Expenditure Review (PER,
April 2000) was very influential in this regard. The PER helped to shape the framework for many of the
public expenditure reforms that are currently under implementation or envisioned. This has been
followed up with intensive technical assistance and dialogue-in collaboration with the UK Department
for International Development (DfID)-which have helped (and will continue to help) HMGN develop
and implement the MTEF. As important, the Bank’s continuing dialogue with the authorities on the topic
of the financial sector reforms-including financing the RBB/NBL diagnostic studies and the Nepal:
Financial Sector Study (October 2002)-have kept the process on track, although admittedly progress has

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned

Appendix 11
Page 4 of 9

at times been slow’. Other key pieces have also focused on reform agenda items, including: (i) Priorities
and Strategies f o r Education Sector Reform (July 2001) which helps to identify and build consensus on a
comprehensive reform agenda at all levels in this fundamental sector2; (ii) Proposed Power Sector
Development Strategy (March 200 1) which identifies the key constraints and makes recommendations to
expand Nepal’s hydropower resource potential to service the electricity needs of the people and to
generate export potential; (iii) The Business Environment and Manufacturing Performance in Nepal
(December 2000), the first investment climate survey carried out in the South Asia Region; and (iv) more
recently, the Nepal: Trade and Competitiveness Study (July 2003), carried out under the Integrated
Framework (IF).
Another AAA focus area has been governance, including decentralization and improving service
delivery. The study Poverty at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century (May 1999) analyzed poverty trends
and projections, the poverty profile and key elements for a poverty alleviation strategy. Related to service
delivery, the Terai Options Study (October 2000) examined experience with various institutional
arrangements for delivery of rural services in the Terai and makes recommendations for future
development of cost-effective service delivery in the context of decentralization. A Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) was finalized in FYOl and many of its recommendations are being
implemented. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)--carried out with an extremely
committed HMGN partner and other donors-was completed in FY02, also with an agreed action plan
currently under implementation3, In the area of decentralization, three areas-the proposed Poverty
Alleviation Fund (PAF), fiscal decentralization, and local institutions in the delivery of services in rural
areas-have been selected as focal areas for the coming years. The PAF policy note Towards a
Sustainable Approach for Poverty Reduction and Decentralization in Nepal was finalized in November
2002.
The majority of the formal reports have been-and continue to be-followed up by policy
dialogues, consensus building, and technical assistance, which have resulted in a remarkably high level of
achievement on many of the original CAS outcomes, especially in the areas of public expenditure
management, decentralization, financial sector reform, telecommunications, and education reform.
Among the informal studies, the Bank facilitated and OECDDAC led a Review of Development
Partnerships. The review-a highly consultative exercise+overed the whole gamut of donor-recipient
relationships that have impacted development partnerships in Nepal. The findings complemented
HMGN’s own formulation of a Foreign Aid Policy (FAP) that was endorsed by the development partners
during the 2002 Nepal Development Forum.

Outcomes
Over the last few years, the South Asia Region has emphasized a results-focused work
programming. The Nepal Country Team has been in the forefront of these efforts, and has set the

technical assistance to the central bank.

The intense sectoral dialogue that followed this work and has continued through the implementation of
BPEP has in large part been responsible for triggering the current efforts to transfer school management to
community-based groups.

Financing was obtained under two different Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grants to assist in the
efforts to implement certain recommendations/action plans of the CPAR (related to public procurement
reform) and CFAA (related to public audit reform).

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned

Appendix 11

standard for the countries in the region. Over the last two years, the team has adopted a ‘portfolio
approach’ to outcomes, in which the entire team-not an individual-is held accountable for achieving a
high proportion of outcomes that have been selected using specific criteria. The approach employeddiscussed below-ensures that risluer, but high importance outcomes will also be attempted. The
structure used over the last two years is as follows:
0
Each ‘outcome’ is a significant change that would be highly desirable and possible within the
four-year CAS horizon. For the immediate year ahead, a specific ‘milestone’-i.e., key step
toward achieving the three-year outcome-is defined;

Such a milestone is expected to have less than 100% probability of happening-for practical
purposes probabilities of 20, 40, 60 and 80% are assigned-even with best efforts on the part of
the Bank;
0

The set of outcomes is seen as a ‘portfolio’ in its entirety-i.e., consisting of some highprobability, but relatively low-impact outcomes, and some low-probability, but high-impact
outcomes. To avoid extremes, the set of outcomes is normally constructed with an expected
overall annual success rate of around 65 - 70%4.
0

The matrix and annual milestones are updated each year, with some outcomes replacedeither through achievement or a change in strategic priorities-and new milestones defined;
0

Rather than holding staff accountable for achievement of specific outcomes, the Country
Team is collectively held accountable for the overall outcome of the portfolio5; and
0

0
The same approach is applied to a set of annual milestones as well, so that annual
performance can be monitored against some expected overall achievement rate.

Near the end of each FY, the country team evaluates the achievement of the milestones during the
year. Reflecting on the lessons learned and the experience in general, the team then updates the outcomes
matrix and annual milestones for the following FY. Such a process has led to a situation in which there is
real team ownership and awareness of the milestones and outcomes. This has also resulted in a more
holistic approach to the Bank’s efforts in Nepal, in which sectors and instruments are initially ‘ignored’ as
the team focuses wholly on outcomes, with the discussion on instruments to achieve those outcomes
becoming secondary.
The results of the review exercise for FY03 are presented in Table 1. Of the 15 milestones
established for FY03, 11 were substantially achieved, resulting in an overall ‘success rate’ of slightly
higher than 70%, as compared to the original expectation of 60%. It is interesting to note that a number
of milestones assessed as having a relatively high probability (Le., 80%) of being achieved in the
beginning of the FY-such as developing the design of the decentralization fiscal fkamework, and
launching a joint review of the experience of community-based rural development programs-were not
achieved. However, a number of milestones assessed as having a relatively low probability (Le., 20 or
4

This does not imply that for outcomes that are not fully achieved, there will be no progress. In many cases,
it is likely that some progress toward the ultimate outcome will have been made.

5

Unless an entirely unforeseen event changes the country setting profoundly, a significant shortfall in
r e a c h g the expected rate of achievement would mean either: (i) the initial assessment or strategy was
unrealistic; or (ii) the Bank’s efforts were inadequate.

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned

40%) of being achieved in the beginning of the FY-such as piloting the transfer of management of
primary schools to communities, and establishing a realistic resource ceiling for development
expenditures-were achieved.
Many of the outcomes adopted by the country team for the FY03-FY05 period are closely linked
to the outcomes implicit in the 1998 CAS. These links, as well as an assessment of the CAS outcomes
and the instruments employed to achieve these outcomes, are provided in Table 2.

C.

Lessons Learned

Today, there is a realization within Nepal that the Bank is truly concerned with the well-being of
the poor and that it is not possible to simply ‘negotiate’ aid out of IDA. However, this realization was not
necessarily quick or easy in coming, and along the way, a number of important lessons have been
learned-both fi-om our experiences in Nepal and world-wide, including through initiatives such as The
Global Poll (May 2003). While many of these lessons have been alluded to above, they can be
summarized as follows:
0
In an environment of poor governance, closely linking lending levels to progress in implementing
reforms and achieving results on the ground-not just promises-can be tremendously effective in a
country such as Nepal. In doing so, it is important to send a firm and consistent message-and most
importantly, stick with it-that unless the important issues are seriously tackled-improving governance
and service delivery-additional funding will not be forthcoming (at least fi-om the World Bank). While
such an approach by itself would not prompt reforms, when spontaneous reform initiatives emerge, it can
provide an important and constructive discipline to the process and can even strengthen the hands of the
reform leaders. Such a stance can foster peer pressure among senior officials to look at development
more holistically, as they realize that sectoral funds are held hostage to improvements in larger country
goals (i.e., governance);

A work program grounded in an outcomes approach-in which all team members share
responsibility for achievement of a portfolio of outcomes-acourages a more holistic and multi-sectoral
approach. Outcomes should be realistic, focused on those areas where the Bank plays a significant role,
and clearly linked to stated country objectives (such as PRS objectives or MDGs). In addition, it is
important to be able to measure milestoneshntermediate indicators and periodically monitor and evaluate
whether these milestones are being achieved;
0

0
The introduction of a number of important reforms-such as the MTEF, the financial sector
reforms, the IAF’, and the transfer of primary schools to community management-have resulted from a
long Bank association and consistent dialogue with HMGN. To be most effective, it is essential to invest
in a solid relationship built on a strong dialogue with key counterparts. In addition to building consensus
for changeheform, such an investment also builds and encourages ownership of and buy in for the reform
programs, while proactive outreach contributes to a wider understanding of development challenges and
opportunities;

Implicitly assuming a quick transition to the base case, the Bank continued to prepare a number
of larger, ‘reform-heavy’ projects during the CAS period. In retrospect, opportunities were likely missed
to develop and deliver a few more ‘low case appropriate’ projects-typically modest in size, and often
supporting community-based projects or small, sector specific reform efforts (e.g., telecommunications
sector);
0

The interplay of diverse political economy realities has an important impact on reform
implementation and hence, needs to be understood better for the Bank to be more opportunistic in its
0

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned

support. When reforms do happen, they often appear to be spontaneous and episodic, and tend to fall
outside the conventional frameworks that donors prefer to work in. Finally, Government officials are not
necessarily good at showcasing reform progress, nor are they practiced at communicating successes to the
public at large. These are important aspects to stress if the benefits of reforms are to be the best arbiter
for deeper reforms in the future;
The linkages between peace and stability, and reducing poverty are strong-i.e., a potential
vicious circle. Developmentlpoverty reduction can not delayedpostponed until there is peace and
stability, as the root causes of conflict-Le., failure of governance, including lack of delivery of public
services, and horizontal inequality and social exclusion-are often the major challenges of reducing
poverty; and
0
Donor coordination is important, but is not always easy as donors often send different and mixed
messages to the Government--e.g., the Nepali reform efforts of the late-1990s/early-200Os warrant low
case lending levels vs. these reform efforts warrant base case lending levels. Ultimately, the Government
must be encouraged to coordinate donor assistance by setting out its own development strategies and
priorities. Clearly, donors-including the Bank-need to respect Government efforts to ‘regulate’ foreign
assistance through vehicles such as a Foreign Aid Policy (FAP). Such an effort, along with a firm
foundation for donor assistance-such as that contained in a Poverty Reduction Strategy-will encourage
more holistic and coordinated development.

The 2003 Immediate Action Plan
The development of the 2003 Immediate Action Plan (IAP)marks the second year of HMGN’s
continuing efforts to bolster the country’s track record for implementing reforms. In June 2002, the
Council of Ministers adopted the first Immediate Action Plan (IAP) to establish a track record for
implementing what it promises. The 2002 IAP focused on expediting reforms in three areas-prioritizing
public expenditures, improving service delivery and fighting corruption, as well as improving
accountability. The successful implementation of the first IAP established a common understanding on
the essential need to carry out all the actions included in the IAP. Moreover, their implementation has
helped to establish credibility for HMGN for undertaking reforms. Building on the success of the 2002
IAP,HMGN has subsequently decided to formulate an annual IAP to bridge capacity gaps and expedite
key reforms.
The 2003 IAP contains a set of measures that are critical for the successful implementation of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). This second IAP consists of 24 reform actions-an increase from the
set of 19 contained in the 2002 version. Not only are the measures directly linked to the four PRS pillars,
most programs are tied to the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The Cabinet approved the
IAP in July 2003 and implementation of most actions is expected to begin by September 2003. In
addition to the three areas covered under the 2002 IAP,the current IAP includes reforms in agriculture,
private sector development, rationalization of SOEs, infrastructure development, targeted programs,
decentralization, as well as measures to address human rights. The Reform and Development Group-a
joint government-donor task force responsible for developing the IAP- identified lead Ministries and
donor agencies (‘Lead Agencies’) responsible for carrying out detailed assessments of the respective
actions.
The assessments include an explanation of the impact or importance of the actions, monitoring
indicators, specific outcomes, preliminary cost estimates, timeframe for implementation and the key
implementing agencies on both HMGN and donor sides. The 2003 IAP actions and assessments are
presented in the following matrix.

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Nepal
On August 22,2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation with Nepal.2
Background
Nepal remains among the poorest countries in the world with almost 40 percent of the population living in
poverty due to insufficient growth and inadequate targeting of the poor. During the 1990s, macroeconomic
conditions remained broadly stable and the fiscal position was manageable, but growth was constrained by
financial sector weahesses, weak public sector management, and poor governance. In the financial sector,
Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) oversight is still weak, and intermediation is inadequate largely due to a banking
environment in which loan default is endemic, especially by well-connected borrowers. Partly as a result of
this, the two largest commercial banks now have large nonperforming assets. Similar problems exist at two
large development banks. In the public sector, investment has been spread.thinly over projects and enterprises
suffer from weak management and accountability. More recently, intensified security problems and adverse
external developments contributed to lower growth and the fiscal position has deteriorated since 2000/01.
The ceasefire agreed in January 2003 with the insurgents has renewed hopes for peace and efforts have been
made to sustain the reform momentum. Progress in achieving lasting peace would facilitate poverty reduction
and implementation of policies contained in the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
However, political uncertainties persist as major political parties continue to maintain that the appointment of
governments by the King since the dissolution of parliament is unconstitutional. The parties have also refused
to join the peace talks.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, whch fonns the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities.

Appendix IV
Page 2 of 5

GDP growth is estimated to be 2 percent in 2002/03. The ceasefire has helped restore some normality in the
transport and service sectors and the decline in tourism may have halted. There are also signs that some
exports and manufacturing production are rebounding. Inflation, which rose to about 7% percent in mid-May
(1 2-month basis) reflecting price developments in India, administrative price changes, and supply factors, is
expected to moderate by early 2003/04.
The 2002/03 budget met revised targets set in a mid-term review. Based on weak revenue performance due to
lower activity during the first half of the year and external aid shortfalls relative to the initial budget targets,
the authorities revised the budget at mid-year. Specifically, the tax revenue target and external financing were
revised down. To compensate for these shortfalls, total expenditure was also revised down and the revised
budget set a net domestic financing target of 2 percent of GDP. Following the announcement of the ceasefire,
economic activity picked up and revenue performance improved. However, capital spending was below the
revised budget, reflecting continued implementation constraints at the local level. As a result, domestic
financing was around 1% percent of GDP.
Monetary policy has been accommodative and the real effective exchange rate has depreciated. To help
economic recovery, the NRB lowered cash reserve requirements by 1 percentage point in August 2002 and
maintained a refinancing facility for lending to “sick” industries. Aided by the recovery in activity and
monetary easing, private credit appears to have revived and higher remittances contributed to a rise in banking
system foreign assets. However, reserve money growth has been curtailed, due largely to lower net credit to
the government. Lending and deposit rates have declined somewhat. The Nepalese rupee has depreciated in
real effective terms since early 2002, reflecting the peg to the Indian currency which has appreciated only
somewhat against the weakening US dollar.
Balance of payments developments turned favorable in mid-2002/03 and external reserves are adequate. Large
and increasing remittances helped buoy the current account. Garment exports began recovering in late 2002,
while recorded exports to India declined, carpets and pashmina exports continued to stagnate, and imports
increased with the recovery. The current account (excluding official transfers) is expected to move into a
deficit of about K percent of GDP, but with higher aid and other inflows official foreign exchange reserves are
expected to rise to US$1 billion (6% months of imports of goods and services).
In 2002/03, significant progress was made in financial sector reform implementation. The NRB took steps to
reduce staffing through a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS). Progress was made in restructuring the two
largest commercial banks, which had external management teams installed. The teams have prepared
management plans, made progress in assessing the banks’ financial status, and proposed VRSs to reduce
overstaffing. Some improvements have already taken place with success in loan recovery and branch
rationalization, although loan recovery from well-connected borrowers continues to be difficult. Prioritization
of budgetary spending improved, anti-corruption efforts were boosted, and public enterprise reform
implementation and governance reforms progressed. To improve prioritization, a Medium Term Expenditure
Framework was introduced with World Bank assistance to help align development spending with national and
sectoral priorities. Administered price increases for petroleum products were announced in March 2003,
although some price increases were rolled back under public pressure. Liquidation procedures were initiated
for four public enterprises; preparations for the privatization of one enterprise were brought to an advanced
stage.
Governance reforms progressed and anti-corruption efforts were boosted. The cabinet approved in September
2002 the elimination of 7,500 vacant civil service positions. To tackle corruption in public life, the

Appendix IV

Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority and a newly established Judicial Commission initiated
investigations against politicians and revenue officials perceived to have accumulated unaccountable assets.
The Anti-Corruption Strategy was adopted.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors stressed that to address the pervasive level of poverty in Nepal, growth needs to be raised
significantly over the medium term through vigorous implementation of structural reforms, particularly in the
financial and public sectors. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), which is founded on broad-based growth, social sector development, targeted programs for the
poor and deprived groups, and improved governance. Directors looked forward to considering a Joint Staff
Assessment of the PRSP in the near future. They encouraged the authorities to reach early agreement on a
program that could be supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility to help achieve PRSP goals.
Directors welcomed the ceasefire agreement with the insurgents reached in January 2003. They underlined
that continued peace was essential to help sustain the economic recovery currently under way. Directors also
noted that progress in the peace talks and the build up of confidence should help relieve budgetary pressures
for security spending.
Directors commended the authorities’ for maintaining broad fiscal stability to create conditions to support
economic growth. Looking forward, Directors endorsed the authorities’ fiscal strategy based on revenue
mobilization, expenditure prioritization, and a reduction in domestic borrowing. They welcomed the 2003/04
budget as the first step in implementing this strategy. However, Directors called for a determined effort to
meet the revenue targets and to resist spending pressures. To raise revenue over the medium term, Directors
suggested cuts in exemptions, improvements in tax and customs administration, and increases in the VAT rate.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to prioritize development spending to help achieve poverty reduction
goals, including the introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework, and encouraged the extension of
such efforts to all expenditures. Directors noted that the envisaged reductions in domestic borrowing would
help maintain fiscal sustainability over the medium term, especially in view of potentially large contingent
liabilities from financial sector and public enterprise reforms. Continued technical assistance in the fiscal area
will help address capacity constraints.
Directors agreed that monetary and exchange rate policies should remain geared to supporting the exchange
rate peg to the Indian rupee, stressing that the peg had served Nepal well given its close links with India.
Looking forward, they noted that prospective external developments, such as the phasing out of the MultiFiber Agreement, would likely have implications for external competitiveness and the appropriate choice and
level of the peg. Directors pointed to the need for policy measures to ensure that remittances are sustained, as
well as for efforts to diversify Nepal’s export base. They also noted that external competitiveness could be
enhanced by measures to raise labor productivity and lower transport costs.
Directors commended the authorities for progress in financial sector reforms, but noted that much remained to
be done. They stressed the need for strengthening Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) supervision of the financial
sector. The NRJ3 should also improve performance incentives for skilled personnel, while encouraging
separations at lower levels. Directors welcomed the appointment of external managers at the two largest
insolvent commercial banks, and noted recent steps taken by the new managers to improve the financial
condition of the banks. To help support these efforts and, more generally, to create a sound banking
environment, Directors noted the authorities’ intention to phase out priority sector lending requirements, and

Appendix IV
Page 4 of 5

emphasized the effective implementation of recently adopted debt recovery mechanisms, including the Debt
Recovery Tribunal and blacklisting of loan defaulters.
Directors welcomed ongoing public sector reforms, including the elimination of vacant positions, the
introduction of merit-based promotions, the decompression of the wage scale, as well as improvements in the
public procurement process. Looking forward, Directors recommended the adoption of civil service
accountability in order to improve policy implementation. They welcomed the public enterprise reform efforts
that would lower government ownership in the economy and increase the enterprises’ net budgetary
contribution-through privatization and restructuring of viable enterprises and liquidation of unviable ones.
Several Directors stressed that due regard should be paid to the pace and sequencing of these reforms. Also, an
appropriate compensation scheme could help smooth implementation of workforce reductions.
Directors welcomed recent efforts to combat corruption, but emphasized the need to pursue forcefully those
responsible for the misuse of public funds. Directors supported the authorities’ plans to increase
decentralization to enhance service delivery. However, they noted that the implementation of these measures
should be accompanied by improved public sector governance and capacity building at the local level.
Directors supported measures to improve the business climate for private sector development through legal
reforms and streamlining of administrative procedures to facilitate trade. They recommended revisions to labor
legislation to make labor hiring more flexible and modifications to the Company and Insolvency Acts to allow
more orderly and timely exit of unviable firms.
Directors commended Nepal for its open trade regime, and welcomed the authorities’ efforts to gain early
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Directors welcomed the elimination of the exchange restriction
arising from quantitative limits on payments for personal travel. Directors encouraged the authorities to further
improve statistics to enhance policy formulation and monitoring. They urged full implementation of Fund
technical assistance recommendations.

The Main Findings of Two Key Fiduciary Assessments:
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
A.

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment’

Context
Nepal’s legal and regulatory framework for ensuring public sector financial accountability is
impressive for a country at its level of economic development. The 1990 Constitution requires the
Ministry of Finance to submit a detailed comparison of the financial results and budgets of all ministries
to Parliament at the end of each fiscal year. The Constitution also accords the Auditor General (AG)
complete legal and professional independence, exempting his emoluments and the budget of the Office of
the Auditor General (OAG) from parliamentary vote. The Constitution also created a Commission for the
Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to investigate and recommend actions against errant and
corrupt officials and prosecute them, if necessary.
Furthermore, when the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)-headed by a member of the main
opposition party in Parliament-was in session, it was proactive in its undertahngs. It is schedule to
meet year round discussing public accounts and the AG’s annual report and recommendations, as well as
all aspects of public sector financial management. All meetings are open to, and receive full coverage in,
the press, and it intervenes in on-going procurement processes when impropriety is suspected. Its
collaboration with the AG is exemplary. It sends the AG’s recommendations to the HMGN with a
directive for the implementation of such recommendations.
The 1999 Financial Procedures Act and 1999 Financial Administration Regulations (FAR)
contain detailed and comprehensive provisions for: (i) budget preparation and approval; (ii) accounting
and reporting on budget implementation every four months; (iii) a detailed report (Schedule 2 of the
FAR) that includes a statement, not only of expenditures, but also of physical results and goals achieved;
(iv) elaborate procurement and internal control procedures; (v) annual financial statements at all levels,
with a consolidated financial statement for the whole public sector at the end of each fiscal year; (vi)
internal and external audits; (vii) ministerial review of project implementation at regular intervals
throughout the year, with rewards for good performers and explanations for poor performance.
The 1999 Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) presents the structure of local government. The
roles, responsibilities and relationships of District Development Committees (DDCs), Municipalities, and
Village Development Committees (VDCs), and the Councils which govern them are explained in the
LSGA. The regulations for financial accountability at the local level are even more impressive than those
at the center. They contain provisions and instructions for: (i) budget preparation; (ii) proper accounting

The CFAA was jointly carried out by HMGN and the Bank beginning in December 2001, with the
establishment of a high level National Steering Committee (NSC). The NSC played a pivotal and strong
leadership role which demonstrated the high level of HMGN ownership, and also was extremely useful in
guaranteeing a high quality product. Throughout the process, a number of stakeholders meetings were
held, including with representatives of donors, government agencies, oversight agencies and private sector
agencies. Following a stakeholder’s workshop in which over 200 people participated, formal discussions
of the final CFAA report were carried out in June 2002. Subsequently, HMGN adopted the Development
Action Plan of the CFAA.

and reporting; (iii) creation of an Accounts Committee in every local body to oversee financial
management; (iv) internal and external audits; (v) project monitoring; and (vi) an elaborate system for
“ex-post” evaluation of projects which assesses, not only the direct costs and benefits of each project, but
also the impact on employment creation and on the environment.
Key Findings
The following are the CFAA’s key findings.
While the legal framework appears comprehensive, Nepal has been less successful with
compliance and implementation of the regulations, but commitment to upgrade the public sector’s
financial management is strong. Compliance with the provisions of the FAR either has not been accorded
the priority implied by the regulations. Schedule 2 of the FAR which requires reporting on physical and
goal achievements is inadequately monitored. With adequate monitoring, the linkages between financial
progress and physical outputs/outcomes could be measured in ways that would fully meet the Bank’s
financial management requirements for Bank-financed projects. The imposition of penalties and fines
prescribed by the FAR for non-compliance with reporting or other requirements is not strictly enforced.
Until recently, 95% of the legal cases brought by the CIAA against errant officials have been
unsuccessful but the success rate is reported to have improved to as much as 50%.
At the local level, monitoring has been weak with the lack of adherence to M&E by most
institutions as required by the LSGA. While accounting staff possess minimum technical qualifications
required for the job, they have little or no experience in project accounting and financial management.
Technical staff are known to give low priority to resource allocation and to establishing good financial
management systems in their respective agencies/projects. Compliance with internal controls and internal
audits have to be strengthened. While the proactive involvement of the PAC during project
implementation process has helped to check any malpractices or misdeeds, it can at times cause delays in
decision-malung with negative implications for development.
Several explanations have been given for the dichotomy between precept and practice: (i)
insufficient political commitment or demand for compliance with financial accountability rules and
regulations; (ii) reluctance to punish or impose sanctions on anyone; (iii) reported corruption in civil
service appointments, promotions and transfers; (iv) politicization of the civil service and its decisionmaking processes; and (v) some donors and foreign development partners bypassing the requirement for
establishing financial systems and requirements for the projects they support, thereby contributing to the
lack of compliance with the country’s laws and regulations.
Ultimately, the problem with compliance can be attributed to two basic factors. First, Nepal is
still in the process of fully developing a solid financial management framework for implementing the
laws and regulations on public accountability. For example, tying expenditures to outputs and outcomes
requires a budgetary system that specifies outputs or results expected from expenditures as well as funds;
accounting and reporting systems that recordreport quantitative and qualitative achievements in addition
to financial data/financial statements; and an auditing system which enables an independent auditor to
trace expenditures and their results. Second, political instability including frequent government changes
and more urgent priorities have diminished the attention on financial management needs.
The present challenge for Nepal is supporting institutional changes to shift away from inadequate
compliance to earnest and consistent implementation of the country’s existing impressive legal and
regulatory framework.
The CFAA’s Development Action Plan (DAP) contains a host of
recommendations towards improving financial accountability of the public sector and a summary is
provided below.

CFAAEPAR

Appendix V
Page 3 of 7

Budgeting and Accounting
Transparent criteria must be developed for selecting officials to handle state funds, whether in the
form of revenue or as spending budget. A key requirement would be the ability of the individual to
properly account for the funds as stipulated by existing regulations, including reports on physical results
or measurable goals achieved from previous expenditures and to be achieved from the proposed
prograddevelopment expenditure.
No budget should be accepted or approved for any public office, whether at the village,
municipal, district, department or ministry level, nor should Parliament approve the national budget
unless the relevant budget contains: (i) a retrospective account of physical or other measurable
achievements or goals resulting from previous expenditures; and (ii) a prospective forecast of the physical
results or other measurable goals expected from proposed expenditures. A suitable simplified framework
should be developed that can be realistically implemented at the local (village, municipal and district)
level.
Each disbursement to any office (whether at local or at central level) should be made against a
report from that office showing: (i) expenditures for the immediately preceding period and their physical
or other measurable achievements; and (ii) the proposed expenditures and their anticipated physical or
other measurable achievements.
Independent Auditing and Parliamentary Oversight
The following measures would go a long way to improving the chances that the recommendations
of the OAG and the PAC are implemented.
The Monitoring Section of the National Planning Commission (NPC) should be strengthened to
ensure full ownership by NPC for instituting a realistic system of monitoring all development
projects, in addition to the core projects, in close collaboration with concerned line ministries, and to
report their progress three times a year.
The Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO) and the internal audit services at central and local
levels ought to be strengthened to be able to: (i) certify offices qualified to receive and properly
account for funds; (ii) monitor compliance with the new regulations (that is, the above
recommendations) all through the year; and (iii) take proactive actions to rectify any violations of
rules and regulations before they are raised by external auditors.
The OAG should improve its capacity to confirm annually whether or not the new rules are being
complied with and to provide services in financial auditing and outcomes-based performance
auditing.
Capacities of the line ministries have to be built to effectively monitor their programs and prepare
time-bound action plans to rectify issues or implement recommendations in the OAG's report. MOF
must monitor the implementation of the action plans of all ministries.
MOF should establish an effective monitoring system to follow up on reported irregularities and
periodically report on the actions taken. Such monitoring should include the status of the following:
(i) audit backlogs and action plan to keep all audits up-to-date; (ii) revenue realization; (iii) clearing
reimbursable grants and loans; (iv) tax deduction at source; (v) repayment of principal and interest
made by HMGN on guaranteed loans but not recovered from concerned institutions; (vi) dividends
receivable, and other receivables, from corporate bodies and boards; (vii) amounts to be paid by
HMGN to various entities; and (viii) follow-up on the recommendations of the PAC.

CFAA/CPAR

Appendix V
Page 4 of 7

The PAC must be given an unambiguous and enforceable mandate to insist on political demand for
accountability and transparency and compliance with the new regulations.

Fiduciary Risk and Programmatic Lending
For fiduciary risk on programmatic lending to approximate the fiduciary risk now accepted for
project lending, accountability and internal control standards in the whole civil service must approximate
those currently existing in Bank-financed projects. The existing legalh-egulatory fiamework meets these
standards but compliance must be enhanced. The objective for HMGN should be to harmonize the
reporting system that is acceptable to all donors. There is no reason to not consider some budgetary
support/programmatic lending, but it should be accompanied by: (i) a pragmatic program of targeted
assessment and strengthening of sectors and institutions scheduled to benefit from such lending; and (ii)
implementation of the recommendations made in the DAP for the public sector over the medium term.
Sectors, ministries and institutions envisaged for budgetary support should be the first to be
assessed and certified by a panel of independent experts representing the accountability institutions which
include MOF, FCGO, NPC and OAG (or may also include experts designated by donor partners
participating in budgetary support) as complying with the accountability standards recommended above.
Following the full implementation of the proposed integrated financial management improvement
program, a quick review would be desirable to confirm the effectiveness of the compliance system, before
generalized programmatic lending benefiting all sectors, ministries, and institutions is launched. All
levels of government would need to be reviewed for adequate compliance before moving forward.
A Task Force or a Reform Monitoring Committee should continue to monitor the implementation
of the recommendations of the CFAA. Implementation status should be periodically reported to the
Finance Committee of the Parliament, the Finance Secretary, and Nepal’s development partners.

Capacity Building and Implementation of CFAA Recommendations
Implementation of the CFAA recommendations in the form of the DAP by the entire public
sector has been underway since mid-2002. A progress report of the Plan is regularly updated and posted
on the MOF’s external website. In addition, the Government requested the Bank’s assistance in two
areas: capacity building of the accounting and auditing staff and upgrading the quality of audits.
Specifically, the request entailed enhancing the capacity of the OAG towards improving public sector
financial accountability. In March 2003, the Bank provided an Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
grant of US$0.5 million. On the basis of the CFAA recommendations and agreement reached with the
OAG, the grant will finance: (i) the revision of the audit guidelines and reporting methodology to be
compatible with international standards or best practice; and (ii) the establishment of institutionalized
training arrangements within OAG to implement the guidelines.

The Country Procurement Assessment Report’

Context
Like most countries, Nepal’s constitution does not address the issue of public procurement, but in
contrast to most countries, there is no law (in the sense of a generally applicable set of rules enacted by
the legislature) about public procurement. In this respect, Nepal (like its neighboring countries Pakistan
and India, and a few others) is different from most other countries in the world. Most countries have
introduced a public procurement law, enacted by parliament which alone can change it, which law deals
exclusively with the public procurement of goods, works and services by governmental entities at all
levels, and most often both for the central authorities as well as those on a provincial and communal level.
The system used in Nepal is represented by the Financial Administration (Related) Rules of
1999” (FAR99) was originally introduced by the British but is no longer practiced in the U.K. This
approach consists of the issuance by government (rather than by the legislature) of a set of financial rules
which essentially describe the financial powers of various governmental authorities, and in particular the
procedures they should follow in securing and disbursing the public funds required to discharge their
functions, including the rules governing the procurement of public contracts. Having been issued by
government, these rules-i.e., FAR99--can also be changed by government, without any approval by the
legislature, which it is felt in most countries is not in the public interest. Rules of this nature, which
govern the use of huge amounts of public funds, should be difficult rather than easy to change, and they
should be changed only in a public and transparent manner.

Key Findings
Procedures and Practices
FAR99 represents an improvement over its predecessor but the enactment of a Public
Procurement Law is a necessity. The Bank revised the rules for National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
under Bank-financed contracts, in order to properly reflect the interests of the public purchaser. In fact,
the list (noted below) indicates the areas of the public procurement system requiring attention.
Provision of sufficient time for bid preparation.
Bidders access to bidding documents by mail or in person.
Evaluation of bids according to pre-disclosed criteria.
Bid opening in only one place and immediately after deadline for bid submission.

No preference to local bidders competing with foreign bidders.
Contract awarded to lowest evaluated bidder.
No post-bidding negotiations with the lowest or any other bidder.

No bid rejection on the basis merely of price estimates.
No rebidding without IDA’Sprior concurrence.
Requirement for all bidders to provide bid and performance securities.

The CPAR was carried out as jointly between the Bank and HMGN. The work was initiated in November
1999 and finalized in April 2002.

Issues Related to Expertise, Audit, Anti-corruption
In addition to the problems related to the legal and procedural framework in which procurement
is conducted in Nepal, there are other problems mentioned below:
0

0

0

0

Like in almost all borrowing countries of the Bank, there is a tremendous need to train public officials
in the principles and practices of public procurement.
The Auditor General’s staff has been found, in the case of donor-financed contracts, to insist upon the
application of local procurement rules instead of the donor’s procurement rules (although the
applicable Nepalese rules make it clear that the latter should apply).
Nepalese laws and rules dealing with corruption seem to penalize only passive corruption (i-e,,the
soliciting or accepting of bribes by public officials), but not acts (just as dangerous) of active
corruption (Le., the offering or giving of bribes to public officials by private parties).
There is a perception amongst the bidders and business community that corruption is a problem in
public procurement in Nepal.

Summary of Major Recommendations
The 2002 CPAR contains the following principal recommendations:
0

0

0

Enacting a modem, transparent and competitive public procurement law, based on the UNCITRAL
Model Law for Procurement, to apply to public procurement by all public entities in Nepal at all
levels, as well as to parastatals.
Creating a small, independent procurement agency, with functions defined by the Public Procurement
Law (essentially policy, and not oversight or line clearances of procurement decisions).
Pending the enactment of such a Public Procurement Law, amend FAR’99 in the sense of changing
the anti-competitive rules and practices listed in this Executive Summary.

Review and develop as needed standard bidding documents to be used for procurement financed by
HM own government.
Develop and accelerate procurement training at all levels of government, including the Auditor
General’s staff.

0

0

Instructing the Auditor General’s staff, in the case of donor-financed procurement, to insist on the
application of the donor’s procurement rules and not of local procurement rules.
Amending the anti-corruption legislation in such a way as to (i) impose harsh penalties (including
blacklisting) on the acts of active fraud and corruption, particularly the offering/giving of bribes to
public officials, and (ii) specifically allowing/inviting bidders to report acts of corruption by other
bidders, as well as solicitation of bribes by public officials.

Capacity Building and Implementation of CPAR Recommendations
The Government is strongly committed to implementing the CPAR recommendations. The
Government revised provisions of the FAR99 soon after the publication of the CPAR. They include
ensuring sufficient time for bid preparation, evaluation of bids according to pre-disclosed criteria,
awarding of bids and prohibiting post-bidding negotiations with bidders.
The Bank is currently providing technical assistance through a three-year IDF grant of about
US$0.3 million to implement three areas of the above-mentioned CPAR recommendations. The grantlaunched in March 2003-will finance: (i) the development of a draft modem transparent and competitive
Public Procurement Law in line with international standards and related rules and procedures; (ii) the
creation of a comprehensive framework for public procurement training and building a pilot training
program particularly for trainers and officials responsible for the management of public procurement.
