SUMMARY

-

The Algeria Bank Group Partnership Over FY04-06
1.
The last C A S for Algeria-discussed at the Board on February 27, 1996-was
designed as a
transitional one year assistance strategy to support the massive stabilization program o f the Government
elected on November 16, 1995. Algeria was then at a crucial juncture in i t s history after emerging from a
period of severe acts o f terrorism which led to the loss o f thousands o f human lives and the destruction
o f infrastructure. There was great uncertainty then about the prospects for peace, social and political
stability, and therefore growth. The Bank focused i t s assistance during that transition on helping the
Govemment stay the difficult course o f macroeconomic stabilization while implementing measures to
ease the adverse social impact o f the economic and social crisis arising from the impact o f the sharp o i l
price fall and the acts o f terrorism.

ii.

Algeria achieved a remarkable turnaround since 1996. GDP grew by 3 per cent a year, on
average, from 1999 to 2002, with similar performance from the non-hydrocarbon, nonagricultural sector.
Macroeconomic imbalances had been turned into sizable surpluses by 2001 and inflation fell from over
20 percent in 1994 to 1.4 percent in 2002. Reserves-US$23.1 billion at end 2002-reached their highest
levels since independence in 1962 and surpass n o w the country’s stock o f foreign debt. Despite a
difficult socio-political environment, Algeria has succeeded in making a fundamental opening o f the
political process, with the end o f the one-party system and the adoption o f policies encouraging
democratic principles such as freedom o f the press and association, which l e d to the emergence o f a
vibrant c i v i l society.
...

Algeria i s in i t s early stage o f transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-driven
economy. The government has articulated a comprehensive national development agenda focused o n
reforms to sustain growth, generate employment, and reduce poverty and vulnerability. These reforms
cover a broad spectrum o f political, institutional, economic, and social issues, are complex, and need to
be sustained over the long-term to produce the results required for support f r o m the various stakeholders.
The Government recognizes that the social tensions which are the result o f the high unemployment and
inadequate public services (in housing and water in particular) will not be reduced without sustained,
broad based economic growth.
111.

Bank Group Strategy
iv.
The main goal o f the Bank Group’s Partnership i s to support these fundamental reforms through
a program of analytical and advisory services, institutional capacity building, and demand driven lending,
IFC financing, and/or risk mitigation through structured loans, hedging products, and guarantees. Based
on the consultations with civil society and discussions with the Government, Algeria has three key
development challenges: (i)
h o w to use i t s o i l and gas reserves for the long-run benefit o f the Algerian
population; (ii)
h o w to create growth and employment in the non-oil economy to both benefit from the
surge in the size o f the labor force over the next decade and avoid the social tensions that would be
caused by increased unemployment; and (iii)
h o w to provide better public services so that all Algerians
are able to participate in and benefit from a twenty f i r s t century market economy. Bank Group priorities
for strategic support mirror these challenges and are: (i)
support to fiscal sustainability and hydrocarbon
revenue management to build the basis for a sustained growth; (ii)
support t o removing the constraints to
private sector-led growth, particularly those affecting the business environment, SMEs, the financial
sector, and infrastructure development; and (iii)support the Govemment’s efforts to articulate and
implement a strategy for better service delivery, particularly for water supply, housing, environmental
services (municipal waste management), and human development to meet the critical needs o f i t s
population. IFC will complement the Bank’s support through financial sector development, SME support,
promoting private investments in infrastructure and supporting the Government’s privatization efforts.

ii

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

World Bank Group Portfolio and Assistance Program
v.
The quality o f the Algeria portfolio improved over the past few years following a series o f
aggressive measures to improve performance through the closing o f an ineffective stock o f projects
contracted during the 1980s. Following a CPPR held in February 2003, a strategy for improving quality
at entry and portfolio perfonnance has been put in place in partnership with the different Government
agencies. The establishment o f a liaison office, in January 2002, has proved crucial and successful in
improving relations with the Government, moving the policy dialogue forward, and improving portfolio
implementation.
vi.
Criteria for support. The Bank Group’s support will be guided by the following three strategic
engagement principles: (i)
selectivity; (ii)
a programmatic approach focused on transfer o f knowledge,
capacity building, and improvement o f market perceptions towards Algeria; and (iii)
partnerships,
outreach and knowledge sharing. The Bank Group’s strategic priorities for analytical and advisory
services will be subdivided into two categories: (i)Base case engagement; and (ii)High case
engagement. Scaling up Bank Group support from the base to the high case engagement will depend on
Government’s responsiveness to reforms and implementation track record. The Bank Group will review
these priorities in a CAS Progress Report planned for FY05, after the new Government i s in place
following the April 2004 presidential elections. The following criteria will guide country programming
choices and determine entry into new areas o f engagement or exit from current engagements. These are:
(i)
linking Bank support to the country’s key development priorities; (ii)
engaging in areas where there i s
explicit request and an agreement with the Government; and (iii)
providing support according to Bank
Group’s comparative advantage in technical skills, resources, convening power, or ability to mobilize
intemational expertise.
vii.
Lending Scenarios and Triggers. Given Algeria’s improved financial position and the mediumterm prospects for o i l prices, there i s n o need for an expanded lending program beyond that which would
be needed to deliver the technical assistance. Accordingly, there i s only one base case lending scenario
and Bank lending i s not expected to exceed US$lOO m i l l i o n a year, including the risk mitigating
instruments. If circumstances change, including sharp and sudden falls in o i l prices, or if the
Government requests additional financial support beyond what i s planned in the base case scenario, the
Bank would consider such a request in the context o f the planned CAS Progress Report.

viii.
IFC and M I G A . IFC’s activities in Algeria expanded significantly following the improvements
in the political, security, and macroeconomic environments as well as the Government’s early efforts at
liberalizing the economy at the turn o f the millennium. As o f April 30, 2003, IFC’s net committed
portfolio in Algeria was US$58.6 million. IFC’s portfolio has performed well. IFC’s competitive
position and comparative advantage in Algeria remains strong due to the perceived country risk and the
l o w level o f private sector development. MIGA has facilitated an estimated total amount o f foreign
direct investment in Algeria o f US$248.4 million.
ix.
Risk Management. While Algeria’s strong external position positively impacts credit risk when
taking a short to medium term view, the country’s weak commitment to structural reforms, the existing
political and social problems, and the economy’s hydrocarbon dependency remain important long term
risk factors.

ALGERIA-WORLD BANK GROUP
PARTNERSHIP FOR COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This document‘ provides a framework for a partnership between Algeria and the W o r l d Bank
Group for FY04-06. The relationship between Algeria and the W o r l d Bank Group has been strengthened
over the past few years. A liaison office was established in Algiers in January 2002, and a significant
program o f analytical work and advisory services was requested by the Algerian Government. The
Government would like the Bank Group to continue to fill their knowledge gap in the areas o f fiscal
sustainability in the face o f volatile o i l prices; policies to remove bottlenecks to growth and encourage
private sector-led and labor-intensive growth; financial sector development; and policies to improve
public service delivery (education, health, water and housing) and efficiency and financial sustainability
o f the social protection system (including, active labor market policies, the formal pension system, and
safety nets). The Government has been deeply engaged with the Bank o n the education, health,
agriculture and rural development reforms agenda. The Government sees these reforms as crucial to the
growth, employment, and poverty reduction strategy.
2.
Accordingly, the Bank’s role over FY04-06 will focus on helping Algeria reduce risks for
investors and improve market perceptions, facilitating knowledge sharing, and providing policy advice.
Financial support from the Bank will be flexible and largely focused o n technical assistance to help
Algeria’s institutions modernize and play a more effective role in the new market environment, and
support in risk mitigation. IFC i s expected to scale up i t s transactions and advisory services, particularly
in privatization and SMEs. This i s in line with the MNA regional strategy and the recommendations o f
the task force on strengthening the W o r l d Bank Group’s Support for Middle-Income Countries.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES
A.

Recent Political Developments

3,

Despite a difficult socio-political environment, Algeria has succeeded in making a fundamental
opening o f the political process, with the end o f the one-party system and the adoption o f policies
encouraging democratic principles such as freedom o f the press and association, which led to the
emergence o f a vibrant c i v i l society. U p o n his election in April 1999, President Bouteflika embarked on
a domestic reform agenda and international initiatives, including assuming a leadership role in the N e w
Economic Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), serving as a mediator in regional conflicts,
and being the f i r s t Algerian President to attend the Francophony Summit in 2002.

4.
On the domestic front, the President openly debated the corruption issue in the country and
formed commissions to propose economic and social policy reforms; with a particular focus on the
remaining agenda o f reforms: (i)the judicial system; (ii)
the role o f the public administration under the
new market environment; and (iii)
the education system, with a view to aligning the latter with the needs
o f the new market and knowledge economy, Violence related t o the extremist fundamentalist
movements, which emerged in the early 1990s, has receded and the security situation has dramatically
improved. However, there are s t i l l sporadic attacks by radical Islamists; and pockets o f violence mainly
in the rural areas, and against the military, have persisted.

T h i s strategy was prepared with full participation o f the govemment o f Algeria and civil society. I t reflects the changing nature
o f the Bank Group’s engagement with the Algerian Government and major stakeholders there. I t outlines a framework through
which World Bank Group’s support to Algeria could be strengthened through a demand-driven support to reforms which the
Government i s ready to implement with advice from the Bank Group.

5,
The social unrest, which started in the Kabylie region in 2001, and which led to the boycott o f
the legislative and municipal elections in 2002 in this region, has been the focus o f the political debate in
Algeria. I t has also been at the top o f the Government’s agenda. While there are some signs o f
improvement, the social unrest in the region has not disappeared, and the situation there remains tense.
At the national level, problems remain because the root causes o f the social discontent-lack o f
accountability, high unemployment and the severe water and housing crises-remain.
As i s the case in
many countries facing major elections, the Government may have to face pressures to slow down reform
implementation, to increase public spending to create jobs, and strengthen social protection in the run-up
to the Presidential elections, which are scheduled to take place in April 2004.
6.
There was a l o w turnout at the legislative elections which were held in M a y 2002 (with only 46
percent o f eligible voters casting their votes nationwide against 65 percent in the 1997 legislative
elections). The Front de LibCration Nationale (FLN), the former single ruling party, won a majority in
both the legislative and local elections which were also held in 2002.
B.

Recent Economic Developments

Algeria entered the new millennium with more hope. Starting from a position o f extreme
7.
o i l prices, unsustainable foreign debt servicing, severe acts o f
vulnerability in the early 1990s-low
terrorism which led to the loss o f human lives and infrastructure, social and political tensions, and
external isolation-it has achieved a remarkable turnaround.
8.
Algeria established a strong record o f implementation under the stabilization and structural
adjustment programs started in 1994 with the support of the IMF and the World Bank. Successful
stabilization in the face o f volatile o i l prices, and some progress in structural reforms, have laid the basis
for a growth recovery. GDP grew by 3 per cent a year, o n average, from 1999 to 2002; with similar
growth performance from the non-hydrocarbon, nonagricultural sector, l e d by a strong 5 percent real
growth in value added f r o m private manufacturing industries. GDP growth reached 4.1 percent in 2002.
Higher o i l prices and tighter demand management turned fiscal and current account deficits into sizable
surpluses by 200 1 and inflation fell from over 20 percent in 1994 to 1.4 percent in 2002, due to a marked
drop o f domestically produced food prices which make up to 50 percent o f household consumption
expenditure. The drop in food prices resulted from increased supply o f non-cereal agricultural output,
combined with tax reductions o n small food traders (which account for most o f the food market), and
lower import tariffs. As a result o f price, trade and exchange rate liberalization, the dark days o f severe
rationing o f goods and services are long gone.
9.
Public expenditure adjustment has played a central role in economic developments in Algeria in
line with o i l price movements. Historically, Algerian Governments have tended to relax demand
management policies during o i l booms and tighten them during busts. High unemployment, mounting
social tensions, and increasing pressure to use the large reserves accumulated since end-1999 to relieve
economic and social conditions, pushed the Government t o relax i t s fiscal stance. The government
launched in April 2001 an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) for 2001-04 using the windfall o i l
revenues to boost aggregate demand and generate jobs through public investment in infrastructure and
support to agricultural production and to small-and-medium enterprises. The ERP i s a capital
expenditure program which aims at spending a total of DA525 b i l l i o n (about 13 percent o f the 2000
GDP) over 2001-04, in addition to the regularly budgeted capital outlays. The increase in public
spending turned the 9.9 percent o f GDP fiscal surplus in 2000 into a 1.3 percent o f GDP deficit in 2002,
reflecting higher spending but also a decline in hydrocarbon revenues in 2001 and 2002 (see Figures 1&2
and Table 1).

The o i l boom has generated an unprecedented accumulation o f net foreign assets which led to a
rapid monetary growth from 12.5 percent in 1999-2000 t o over 20 percent in 2001-2002, per year, o n
average. In turn, a strong excess liquidity emerged in the (public) banking system, due to higher deposits

by the o i l company, the substitution o f public banks’ non-performing loans mostly to public enterprises
(equivalent to 12.5 percent o f the 2001 GDP) with Treasury bonds, and a recapitalization o f three public
banks. Despite tightened monetary stance, excess liquidity remains sizeable (M2/GDP was 68 percent in
2002 compared to 50 percent in 2000), highlighting the thinness o f the financial system. Credit to the
economy, representing around a quarter o f GDP, has grown by around 8.5 percent in 2001-2002, mostly
due to increased credit to the private sector, although the latter s t i l l absorbs only about a third o f the total
credit to the economy (see Figure 6). The l o w share of credit to the private sector i s consistent with
private sector’s complaints about lack o f access to credit and public banks’ complaints about the lack o f
bankable projects from the private sector. As a result, private investment financing continues to rely o n
non-bank sources o f financing.

11,
On the external front, the balance o f payments averaged a surplus o f 11 percent o f GDP in 20002002. The surplus in the current account o f the balance o f payments was reduced from 12.4 percent in
2001 to 8.6 percent in 2002 due to lower exports and increased imports, while the capital account deficit
has also narrowed over the same period, following higher FDI-mainly in the hydrocarbon sector,
investments in the telecommunications sector, proceeds from the privatization o f a large steel companyand lower debt amortization (see Table 1).
12.
External debt decreased markedly since 1997 reaching US$22.6 billion (40.7 percent o f GDP) at
end 2002, down from a peak o f US$33.6 billion at end 1996. Debt service declined from 29.7 percent in
1997 to 20.1 percent of exports. Reserves--US$23. l b i l l i o n at end 2002-reached their highest level
since independence and have surpassed current foreign debt levels, turning Algeria into a n e t creditor to
the rest o f the world. The average real effective exchange rate (REER) has remained broadly stable over
the past two years and the parallel market premium has shrunk to 20 percent in 2002.
13.
Vulnerabilities. Despite these remarkable achievements, Algeria remains vulnerable to o i l price
shocks. The o i l sector inevitably continues to affect economic developments in Algeria, as it directly
contributes to around 30 percent o f GDP, provides between 65-70 percent o f total fiscal revenues, and
generates around 97 percent o f total export revenues. The pressure t o use the windfall o i l revenues to
boost aggregate demand and generate jobs through the ERP i s not without risks. A mid-term evaluation
o f the ERP shows that the program will likely have a positive although moderate impact on the real rate
o f growth and i s expected to create some 850,000 jobs. These jobs, however, will be temporary. The
ERP i s also expected to have an impact o n the balance o f payments, as the current account surplus i s
expected to fall by one percent o f GDP over the life o f the program, because o f i t s strong import content.
In terms o f the effects o n public finances, much o f the initial cost o f the program may be offset if the
exchange rate depreciates and thereby increases dinar-denominated o i l export revenues, and if higher
non-oil revenues result fkom higher output. However, Government’s gains will be offset by losses
elsewhere in the economy due to higher import costs and potential inflation and exchange rate pressures.
14.
External vulnerabilities are also considerable. Algerian exports are among the least diversified in
middle-income countries. Non-oil exports account for around 3 percent o f total exports. Seventy five
percent o f non-oil exports are destined to only 5 countries, mostly in southern Europe, and most
enterprises producing exportable goods are State-owned, enjoying considerable protection. The lack o f
diversification has increased revenue volatility. At the same time, dependence o n food imports has
increased and the economy remains highly dependent o n imported inputs and capital goods.
15.
Finally, the resumption o f growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector i s fragile since i t i s s t i l l fuelled
by public investment and therefore vulnerable to o i l price swings. Private investment i s weak due to the
incomplete structural reform agenda which has not yet yielded a conducive business environment,
Access to basic services such as information and telecommunication, transportation, housing, and water
fall short o f the growing demand, and the quality o f education and health services has deteriorated.
Unemployment affects mainly the young (80 percent of the unemployed are under 30), first time j o b
seekers (76 percent o f total), the less educated, urban dwellers, and females. The tight stabilization

5

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

programs over the 1990s, the incomplete reforms and lack o f private sector supply response have
naturally not l e d t o the growth rates which would have allowed an improved welfare o f the population.

16.
Algeria, therefore, s t i l l faces formidable challenges to consolidate and strengthen macrostability
and complete the transition to a sustainable market-based economy by improving the investment climate,
and increasing productivity growth. The strengths and vulnerabilities discussed above have recently
brought t o the fore the need to explore policy options to shelter the economy from the influence o f o i l
price volatility and encourage private sector development. This calls for the management o f the o i l
windfall within an asset and liabilities management framework, ensure fiscal sustainability, strengthen
the output stabilization role o f fiscal policy, improve the investment climate to diversify the economy
away f i o m o i l products and increase productivity growth. This reform agenda i s essential to provide the
basis for an annual real growth o f GDP over 5 percent a year, which will be required to reduce
unemployment and poverty significantly. The Algerian economy i s also threatened by endemic natural
hazards-floods and earthquakes and environmental degradation (soil erosion and desertification).
C.

K e y Poverty Trends and Gender Equity

17.
The social impact of the 1986 oil crisis has been high. The fall in economic growth from over 6
percent a year f r o m 1970 to 1985 to a mere 1.6 percent per year since 1986-well
below annual
population growth of 2.2 percent during the same period-has led to increased vulnerability and poverty.
According to the 1995 household survey data, 14 percent o f the population was below the poverty line;
up f r o m 8 percent in 1988. Although more recent poverty estimates are not available, poverty incidence
i s likely to have increased over the last decade, due to l o w growth and high unemployment, and a
stagnation o f private per capita consumption between 1995 and 2000. An update o f poverty trends,
using the recently available 2000 household budget survey, i s on-going.
18.
Algeria’s poor are concentrated in rural
areas. Seventy percent o f the poor live in rural
areas and more than h a l f o f the rural population i s
poor (see Box 1). The rise in poverty incidence i s
strongly linked to unemployment.
The
combination o f a high labor force growth
(3.4percent during the 1990s resulting in an
estimated annual average o f 250,000 new entrants
in the j o b market), labor shedding in public
enterprises, and the slow growth o f employment in
the private sector, have all contributed to keep
unemployment high.
19.
L a c k o f income i s only one dimension o f
poverty. L a c k o f opportunity, empowerment, and
access to social services, all contribute to
deepening income poverty.
The rural poor,
particularly women, continue to face access
problems, with widening disparities in access to
social services. This i s particularly true for access
to health services and to secondary education.
Reaching the MDG target (under goal 3) o f
substantially increasing the share o f women wage
employment in the non-agricultural sector will be a
challenge (see B o x 2). Insecurity and c i v i l unrest
further contribute to poverty, restricting liberty o f
movement and rendering more difficult the

Box 1: Who Are the Poor?
T h e poor in urban and rural areas have some common
characteristics. Both tend to have larger than average
household sizes, a large proportion of children and a high
dependency ratio. Most own their dwellings, with 80
percent living in traditional houses. T h e poor are more
likely to live in more crowded housing conditions.
In rural areas, people living in households where the head i s
working in agriculture, either as farmer or as agricultural
worker, have higher than average rates o f poverty. Only
about 25 percent o f the rural poor have landholdings. T h e
land-owning poor have small holdings which are primarily
non-irrigated. Diversification o f income sources i s more
common in urban areas for both the poor and non-poor.

Poverty i s strongly associated with low education and
schooling. Enrollment rates are lower for the poor,
particularly in secondary education, in rural areas and
among women.
The incidence of poverty among
households headed by individuals with no schooling i s
much higher than for those whose heads are more educated.
Educational achievements tend to be lower for rural
households, for the poor, and for women. According to the
1995 household survey, poverty incidence i s highest among
the illiterate, especially for the rural poor and women. T h e
illiteracy rate i s highest for rural women (46 percent)
followed by urban women (29 percent), rural men (22
percent) and finally urban men (13 percent). For both
genders and sectors, these rates are highest for the poorest
decile and decline with higher living standards.

provision o f public and social services. Social support structures and networks are weakened during
conflicts, and families and communities are severely affected socially, economically, and
psychologically.
20.
Algeria’s constitution (art 29) guarantees gender equality. Algerian women have the right to
vote, t o be elected, to work, and to be educated. Labor laws guarantee gender equality for work and pay.
The laws also protect working women’s rights and there are n o legal or institutional gender
discriminatory policies except from those contained in the Family Code. The latter has been contested by
various rights organizations because o f i t s open discrimination against women. The Government has
expressed i t s willingness to act to abrogate all discriminatory provisions o f the Family Code. Algeria has
also signed the Convention on the Elimination o f Discrimination against Women in 1996, albeit with
reservations. A new Ministry in Charge o f the Family and Women’s Affairs was created in June 2002.
There are five women cabinet ministers in the current Government and the largest national trade union,
UGTA, has recently established a women’s committee.
21.
There are n o significant gender disparities in access to education, particularly in urban areas.
According to the most recent census (1998), the rate o f schooling for girls in urban areas i s 87.4 percent
compared with 88.7 percent for boys. In the remote rural areas, this rate drops to 60.5 percent for girls
and 74.3 percent for boys (see B o x 1). Secondary school enrollment i s lower for the poor and for girls,
particularly in rural areas. Girls’ retention in school depends primarily on parental choice particularly in
rural areas. Parental decisions are mostly based o n the cost o f schooling since parents who face financial
difficulties tend to prefer to withdraw their daughters rather than sons f i o m school. Insecurity and
inadequate supportive infrastructure (transport, lodging and food o n the premises) also contribute to girls
dropping out o f school.

D.

Key Development Challenges

A complex transition away from state dominance and high dependency on oil
22.

Algeria’s key development challenges are: (i)building a political, social, and economic
environment that would bring growth, employment, social cohesion, and poverty reduction; (ii)
reducing
the economy’s high dependence o n o i l exports and i t s high vulnerability to o i l price volatility; (iii)
building a conducive investment climate to encourage private investment (foreign and domestic); and (iv)
improving the effectiveness o f public service delivery (respect for the rule o f law, education, health,
social protection, water supply and sanitation, and housing) to reduce the cost o f doing business, improve
growth prospects and living standards, and achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.
23.
The first and major development challenge i s to restore social and political stability and reduce
resistance to change. International experience shows that resistance to change, either due to ideological
positions or to fear o f losing one’s privileges, remains, as in a number o f other countries facing similar
transition issues, a major development challenge. And as i t has been demonstrated in a number of
countries facing the same problems as Algeria, the lack o f consensus o n a minimum platform for reform
leads to h a l f hearted policy implementation, desire for the state to remain in control, and frequent
changes of government. This in turn, reduces the effectiveness of the government to carry out the
necessary reforms, prolongs the transition, increases i t s costs and delays the expected benefits from
reforms and with them public support for reforms. For any country, including Algeria, income growth,
improved governance, better public service delivery, and empowerment are crucial t o building a political,
social, and economic environment to sustain growth, employment, social cohesion, and poverty
reduction. This can only be achieved by a broad-based dialogue o n the strategic development objectives,
transparency in decision making processes, and continued deepening o f the democratic process. Such a
dialogue will help improve communications and build consensus between the Government and the other
important stakeholders (such as c i v i l society, political parties, legislative branches, trade unions, and the
army) for a sustainable growth and poverty reduction strategy.

24.
In addition, besides the poor governance, Algeria’s efforts to attract foreign private investment
are hindered by terrorism and the fears o f political instability. Algeria suffers from severe “headline
risk”. For a long time the news coming from the country have been dominated by negative stories.
Despite the remarkable improvement last year, the acts o f terrorism and sporadic hllings are s t i l l scary
news for many investors, and the market will take time to give credit to the country for increased
stability. Algeria needs therefore to pursue i t s efforts to improve the investment climate and achieve
concrete and measurable results to help dispel these negative perceptions.

26.
Future growth prospects will continue to be shaped by developments in the hydrocarbon sector.
The impact of changes in hydrocarbon revenues o n the rest o f the economy will be determined in great
part by the efficiency with which these revenues are intermediated by the government. Strengthening
fiscal policy, in the context o f an integrated fiscal framework, which would include the Revenue
Stabilization Fund, to insulate the fiscal stance f r o m volatile hydrocarbon fiscal revenues, so as t o better
manage macroeconomic volatility and secure fiscal sustainability, will be key to sustained acceleration o f
growth. Such a framework would include: (i)establishing an asset liability management (ALM)
framework using risk management tools to reduce the impact o f the price volatility o f hydrocarbons o n
public finances; (ii)
reducing the exposure o f the budget to the volatile hydrocarbon fiscal revenues
which leads to a pro-cyclical fiscal stance that has exacerbated volatility in the past; (iii)
smoothing out

o f monetary policy; and (iv) securing sustainability o f public debt in the long term as the primary nonhydrocarbon budget deficit i s large (about 25 percent o f non-hydrocarbon GDP) and hydrocarbon fiscal
revenues are eventually exhaustible.
27.
Future growth prospects also depend o n reducing the economic and health costs o f environmental
degradation. The direct negative impacts o f environmental degradation on health, natural capital,
productivity and efficiency o f resource use have been conservatively estimated at 5-7 percent o f GDP.
About 2 percent o f GDP i s lost due to the direct impact on health and the quality o f life; another 2
percent o f GDP loss i s due to the degradation o f the country’s natural capital.
28.
The third development challenge is to improve the business environment. The Algerian state
remains heavily involved in the provision o f goods and services, well beyond what would be justified by
the objectives o f regulation or redistribution, and in excess o f i t s capacity to deliver. Although Algeria i s
less o f an administratively managed economy today than i t was a few years ago, the legacy o f a centrally
planned economy i s s t i l l present. Public sector management remains too centralized. The public
enterprise sector remains large (see Figure 6 )

investment in Algeria (Foreign Investment
Advisory Services (FIAS) Report), and extensive consultations with private entrepreneurs in the country
show that persisting barriers, many related to administrative and business practices that often contradict
the spirit o f the reforms introduced, raise the cost o f doing business in Algeria and undermine the
competitiveness o f the private sector. Foreign investors’ confidence has been negatively affected by
Algeria’s perceived high political risk due t o the continuing violence in the country, delays in
privatization, and what i s perceived as a resurgence o f discriminatory and protective measures.

With a tradition o f high savings, good educational attainment, abundant hydrocarbon resources,
and an advantageous geographic location, Algeria has great potential for rapid and sustainable growth in
the non-oil sector. For this to happen, however, Algeria needs a friendlier business environment to
support the development o f the emerging private sector-the crucial pillar o f a sustainable growth and
employment generation strategy (see Annex 1 for policy recommendations). This would include:
Effectively reducing state intervention to encourage private sector-led growth by
privatizinghestructuring public sector enterprises; removing bottlenecks to registration o f private
firms; withdrawing the State from the provision o f business services; eliminating red tape;
developing a sound market-based financial system to increase the efficiency o f resource
allocation, including by privatizing public banks and strengthening prudential regulations and
supervision; ensuring access to infrastructure, in particular to land.
Increasing the state’s capacity to regulate the market and encourage the private sector to adopt
good corporate governance through the establishment o f the basic legal framework o f a market
economy, including well-defined property rights (in particular for land ownership), enforceable
contracts and decisions, and the security o f an efficient, honest, and effective judiciary, and tax
and customs authorities. The weak legal and judicial system and the lingering security concerns
combine to increase the risk aversion towards investing in Algeria.

32.

The Association Agreement with the EU offers a tremendous opportunity for Algeria’s
integration in global trade markets, but also raises important challenges. N e w enterprises should be
encouraged to take advantage o f export opportunities in the emerging Euro-Mediterranean free-trade
zone. At the same time, import-competing industries will be exposed to increased competitive pressures
once the Temporary Additional T a r i f f (“Droit Additionel Provisoire”; DAP) i s removed. Companies in
these industries-especially public enterprises-will need to undergo considerable restructuring and
improve their efficiency in order to withstand competition. Algeria has made progress towards achieving
competitive unit labor costs in a number o f labor-intensive industries that are important for j o b creation.
Consolidating such competitive positions would need a business environment, to promote investment in
these industries and foster productivity growth. Improving the efficiency o f infrastructure and traderelated services, streamlining customs procedures, and upgrading product standards to international
norms would improve Algeria’s attractiveness for export-oriented investment, allowing Algeria to reap
the benefits from a free-trade zone for industrial products with the EU.

33.
The fourth challenge i s to improve access to and the quality ofpublic services. Access to basic
services, including a w e l l functioning judicial system, are crucial to create the jobs and growth required
for poverty reduction and to ensure that the most vulnerable and least endowed, including women,
participate in such growth.
34.
Human Development and Social Protection. Algeria tried, f r o m independence in 1962, to
improve the living standards o f the population through significant investment in human development,
public employment generation, and extensive social protection schemes. With growth rates over 6
percent per year and booming o i l revenues from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s, Algeria invested
heavily in human development, with average expenditures o n education and health approximating 10
percent o f GDP. Access to basic social services expanded rapidly, and social indicators improved
dramatically. But the decline in o i l prices l e d to a fiscal contraction which affected the social sectors.
The reduction in expenditures has not been accompanied by higher allocative and technical efficiency.
Reforms to improve efficiency are crucially needed to preserve and increase the gains in social indicators
achieved so far, and for Algeria to reach the Millennium Development Goals.

35.
The weaknesses o f the education system have become evident in the face o f mounting budgetary
constraints and growing demand. First, there are important inefficiencies in the allocation o f resources.
M o s t o f the budget goes to pay salaries with little l e f t to spend on inputs and infrastructure. As a
consequence quality has deteriorated and the internal efficiency o f the system has suffered (only 12 out
100 students entering primary education ever obtain a high school diploma). Second, regional and
gender inequalities in terms o f access and outcomes persist and public subsidies are poorly targeted. The
problem i s particularly severe in the case o f higher education where the government covers 90 percent o f
expenditures. The subsidies have generated an over supply o f graduates, often without the necessary
skills, who are finding it difficult to find jobs. The vocational training system i s expensive and not in
line with current market demands. It i s focused on training as a mechanism to assist those students who
drop out o f basic or secondary education (60 percent o f students). In the absence o f competition among
training centers, quality suffers and programs become irrelevant to the needs o f the new market economy.
36.
Algeria i s close to meeting many o f the MDGs in the education sector. Literacy amongst 15-24
year olds i s over 90 percent, for example, and there i s almost universal primary education enrollment
(Box 2). The institutional weaknesses and inefficient resource allocation described above, however, will
limit the capacity o f the education system to address the education needs o f that last group o f Algerians
who do not yet have access to adequate basic education services. Furthermore, there i s a risk that gaps
may widen as the education system continues to have difficulty providing education services to rural
areas, particularly to girls.
37.
Algeria has made considerable efforts to ensure access to health services to i t s population. As a
result, health indicators have improved dramatically. However, reforms are needed to improve the
effectiveness, efficiency and quality o f delivery in the health sector. The rapid demographic transition
will increase further financing needs. The country faces the double challenge o f addressing the
increasing prevalence o f chronic (and expensive to treat) diseases, while s t i l l being confronted with
prevalent infectious diseases. At the same time, the prevalence o f stunting in children under the age o f
five i s s t i l l high (18 percent). Preventive services to diagnose and prevent diseases that affect mainly
women are also inadequate. The current weaknesses in the health system can jeopardize progress in
achievement o f the MDGs (infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition).
38.
Algeria has developed a comprehensive but complex structure o f social protection programs.
The social protection system, largely managed by the Government, costs around 9 percent o f GDP and
reaches about 30 percent o f the population. I t combines three types o f mechanisms: (i)
active and passive
labor market programs; (ii)health, old-age, and unemployment insurance; and (iii)social assistance
programs (including family allowances and targeted cash transfers to vulnerable groups). The system has
had mixed results. In general, active labor market policies such as training and wage subsidies have tried
to substitute for structural reforms that reduce labor market rigidities and promote growth. Support t o
agricultural producer prices (cereals) have also been used as a social protection instrument, distorting
agricultural markets as well, as i s the case in many countries which used this instrument. Results fell
short o f expectations. In terms o f social assistance programs, the main problems are linked to
inappropriate targeting mechanism and monitoring systems.
39.
Insurance systems (health, old-age and unemployment insurance) are unsustainable, and benefit a
minority o f workers in the formal economy. At about 36 percent o f the gross wage bill, social insurance
contributions rates (for pension, health and unemployment insurances) are relatively high, increasing the
n o n wage costs o f labor, and limiting the potential for j o b creation for the low-skilled workers. The
financial sustainability o f the insurance system i s further threatened by a shrinking contributive base as a
result o f unemployment, increase in minimum pensions, and the escalation o f health care costs due to
inefficient health care management. Despite Algeria’s favorable demographics, with i t s current structure,

12

Algeria County Assistance Strategy

the pension system i s projected to accumulate unfunded pension liabilities o f about 6 percent o f GDP by
2008. This threatens fiscal sustainability.

Access to urban services. The rapid population growth and urbanization have exacerbated
40.
further the acute shortages in services. There i s an acute shortage o f serviced land for housing in urban
areas. Large informal settlements (slums) surround the major cities, which resulted in over-utilization o f
the urban environment and enhanced physical vulnerability o f cities to natural hazards. The main
strategic reforms which would help achieve the country’s objectives in the sector consist of: (i)
restructuring the subsidy schemes to reach the target population and improve equity, (ii)
improving land
management to eliminate supply constraints and liberalize land development; (iii)developing a
community-based affordable housing policy to better address existing demand and prevent further
development o f slums through improved housing access to the poor, including female headed
households; (iv) improving access to housing finance, especially important for the housing-constrained
middle-class; and (v) improving labor qualification and competency in the construction sector through
application o f appropriate building codes and development o f vocational training which will result in
higher productivity, cost reduction, quality enhancement and employment generation.

41.

Urban water and sanitation services are also in crisis. Despite a high rate o f connection to the
piped network (about 90 percent o f the urban population) the quality o f service in urban water supply i s
very poor. The Algerian Govemment i s aware that this i s due to a combination o f factors: inattention to
institutional, financial and managerial issues leading to poor utility performance, delays in completing
dams and transfers, and persistent drought. Water tariffs are l o w and have not been increased since 1998.
Water i s delivered to households at an average price o f 15-20 DA/m3, but this average tariff does not
cover full O&M costs; people not served by the piped public water supply system often pay up to
600DNm3. As a result, water i s severely rationed across Algeria (4-6 hours/day for 3 daydweek). The
level o f unaccounted-for water (both physical and commercial losses) i s estimated at about 50 percent.

42.
The connection rate to the sewerage network coverage i s also high in Algeria (about 80 percent)
but as the Algerian Government acknowledges the service quality i s also poor with many pipes clogged
or severely undersized as a result o f the population increase. Moreover, most o f the 49 wastewater
treatment plants in the country are inoperative due to poor maintenance. The wastewater which i s
collected i s discharged mostly without adequate treatment in valleys and the sea, posing very serious
public health hazards.
43.
Addressing the housing and water shortages will be critical to growth, to poverty reduction, and
to reaching the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The middle class and the poor are the most affected by
these shortages. The latter live in precarious and overcrowded housing. They also do not have the
housing infrastructure or the financial capacity to invest-as do the better off-in water storage facilities
which can be seen on the rooftops o f many houses and apartment buildings. Children and women, in
particular, spend a significant amount o f their time fetching water. The potable water situation i s even
worse in rural areas. Lack of clean water poses health risks, and scarcity and storage issues reflect
arduously on rural women, who need to fetch water from long distances. Resolving these two crises i s a
win-win proposition that will generate a virtuous circle o f growth and employment. The development o f
the housing market, for example, will help generate employment of unslulled labor (mainly the poor),
develop vocational training for skilled labor, fuel growth, and improve living standards while winning
support for the necessary structural reforms to support the transition t o a market driven economy, the
only source o f sustained growth and employment generation.

111. MEDIUM-TERMPROSPECTS AND EXTERNAL
DEVELOPMENTS
44.
Medium-term prospects are positive and the country faces moderate risks. The o i l price i s
expected to remain around US$23/barell, above the US$19/barrel budgeted by the Government. With an
approaching Presidential election and amidst increasing social and political tensions, structural reforms
are expected to move slowly. As a result, GDP growth i s expected to remain modest at 3 percent over
the period covered by this CAS, pulled by the o i l sector and construction, which will continue t o benefit
from the ERP as over 70 percent o f the program’s resources will be spent o n public works and municipal
infkastructure development projects.
45.
Given the expansionary fiscal stance, a slight fiscal deficit o f around one percent o f GDP i s
expected to persist over the CAS period. The external position, on the other hand, will remain fairly
strong. While a current account surplus o f over 9 percent o f GDP i s expected in 2003 owing to high o i l
prices and increased o i l
export volumes, this

deficit as the authorities
continue to honor debt repayments that will substantially reduce total foreign debt by around US$2
billion a year. Under this scenario, reserves at Central Bank will be kept at around US$26 billion o n
average, covering around 17 months o f imports o f goods and factor services o n average, thus exceeding
from end-2002 onwards the projected level o f Algeria’s external debt. Inflation o n the other hand i s
expected to increase to around 4 percent a year o n average over the C A S period, due to the continued
implementation o f the ERP and the increase o f money growth. Curtailing inflation will entail continuous
efforts to absorb excess liquidity and tighten public expenditure. The authorities are expected t o
strengthen the use of the indirect instruments for monetary management to absorb liquidity and maintain
price stability.
46.
The most significant risk i s a sudden and sustained drop o f o i l prices. Should o i l prices drop to
US$lS/b and remain there for the period covered under this CAS, and should the current economic
policy stance remain unchanged, particularly public expenditure, internal and external imbalances would
resume. The overall fiscal deficit would worsen from a 1.3 percent of GDP deficit in 2002 to around 9
percent o f GDP deficit in 2003 and remain at that level for the rest o f the CAS period assuming n o
change in expenditure levels. The current account o f the balance o f payments will remain in surplus.
Financing the external imbalance would involve a rapid run down o f reserves by over US$3 billion per
year on average. F r o m a balance of payments view point, Algeria’s current reserve position should buy
the country sufficient time in the event of a drastic and lasting reversal o f o i l prices, allowing i t to tighten
i t s policy stance. Algeria’s exposure to such downside risks underscores the need for a medium-term
savings strategy of hydrocarbon revenues and a prudent management o f the “Fonds de Regulation des
Recettes ”, to prevent the “pro-cyclical” changes in public expenditures seen in the past. It also highlights
the urgency o f developing an active domestic securities market, to facilitate the financing o f temporarybut potentially sizeable-budget imbalances in the future.

14

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

47.
Even without a drastic fall in o i l prices, the continuation o f past economic performance would
not allow a rapid resumption o f growth to improve living standards. The limited growth and export
diversification prospects, the high unemployment rate, and high labor force growth (averaging 3.4
percent in the 1990s-higher than GDP growth), and an ensuing increase in the incidence o f poverty,
would constitute a constant source o f pressure to relax the fiscal policy stance further, as i s already
happening at this moment. Social tensions will persist and so will political instability. These are
important risks factors that would undermine Algeria’s growth and development prospects if reforms
continue to stall.

Iv. THEGOVERNMENT’S
GROWTH
AND EMPLOYMENT
GENERATIONSTRATEGY
48.
T o address the challenges o f growth, employment creation, and poverty reduction, a
comprehensive national development agenda has been developed around the following main objectives:
(i)strengthening the basis for sustainable market-driven economic growth through restoring
macroeconomic stability and improving the investment climate; (ii)
improving the effectiveness o f public
service delivery; and (iii)
improving the living standards o f the population and reducing i t s vulnerability.
Significant progress has been made already in implementing this reform program particularly o n macro
economic stabilization, deregulation, and social protection but as discussed below the implementation o f
structural reforms could have been accelerated, particularly since 200 1.
A.

Strengthening the Basis for Sustainable and Rapid Growth

49.
The government recognizes that the high unemployment and increased incidence o f poverty and
vulnerability o f the Algerian population will not be reduced without sustained, broad based economic
growth. The government acknowledges that i t s needs to continue to better manage i t s o i l revenues to
create a stable macroeconomic fkamework which when combined with a conducive investment climate,
will encourage private investment and growth o f the more labor intensive non-oil sector.

Strengthening Macroeconomic Stability. The government intends to continue i t s prudent
macroeconomic management to maintain macroeconomic stability. T o better manage the o i l windfalls o f
the past few years, the Government established a Revenue Stabilization Fund (Fonds de Regulation des
Recettes) in mid-2000. The Government prepares n o w i t s annual budget on the basis o f a reference o i l
price. All revenues which accrue to the Government in excess o f budgeted revenues are deposited in the
stabilization fund. Revenues generated f r o m the fund’s operation also remain in the fund. The fund’s
reserves are then used to (i)help balance the budget in case o f a revenue shortfall, with the a i m o f
stabilizing public expenditure; and (ii)
reduce public debt. Domestic resource mobilization has been
strengthened through increased efficiency o f collection o f non-oil revenues. The tax system has been
simplified, the tax base widened, and tax administration strengthened (but more remains t o be done o n
the tax and customs fronts). However, exemptions remain important-most t o protect domestic industry
or promote private investment.

50.

5 I. The authorities are aware that the recent relaxation of their fiscal stance-in the context o f the
implementation o f the Economic Recovery Program (ERP)--could endanger their hard w o n
achievements o n the macroeconomic front. The Government i s comforted by the high level o f reserves
accumulated so far, which would enable them to carry out the ERP for some time irrespective o f o i l
market developments. The authorities are, nonetheless, aware that while the looser fiscal stance does not
endanger the balance o f payments nor the treasury position as long as o i l prices remain high, i t carries the
risk o f igniting inflation, appreciating the real exchange rate, and depleting the o i l stabilization fund,
thereby increasing adjustment costs in the event o f an o i l price fall.

15

Improving the Business Environment. In addition to macroeconomic stability, reforms in this
52.
area focused o n enhancing competition, reducing transactions costs, and increasing transparency through
de-regulation, price, trade and payments liberalization; tariffs reduction and rationalization;
modernization o f monetary policy instruments; establishment o f the institutional foundation for the
development o f the financial sector; including banking supervision, tax reform, and public enterprise
reform.
53.
In anticipation o f privatization and following the deregulation o f prices, competition legislation
was introduced in 1995, essentially devoted to a regime o f transparent commercial transactions, and the
creation o f a competition council. The investment and tax codes were revised and an investment
promotion agency was created to facilitate private investment and grant tax exemptions.
A
comprehensive tariff reform was implemented in two stages from August 2001. The 2001-2002 tariff
reform intended to streamline the tariff and reduce rate dispersion ahead o f the finalization o f the AAEU
in 2002 and Algeria’s accession to the W o r l d Trade Organization. These changes will further the need
for additional reform to bring Algeria’s economic laws, regulations and administration in line with WTO
requirements. A new tariff with only three rates (5%, 15%, and 30%), in addition to the zero rate,
became effective o n January 2002. However, a temporary additional tariff (Droit Additionel Provisoire)
was introduced in July 2001-at 60 percent which i s expected to be phased-out in five annual reductions
by January 2006-to protect local enterprises during the transition.

54.
Algeria signed, on April 22, 2002, an association agreement with the European U n i o n (AAEU).
The AAEU, which will come into effect after ratification o f the agreement by Algeria and each o f the
members o f the European Union, implies free trade in industrial products between Algeria and the
countries o f the E U after 12 years from the implementation date. Negotiations toward accession to the
W o r l d Trade Organization (WTO) are ongoing.
55.
On public enterprise reform, the Government focused initially o n cleaning up their portfolio o f
debts to public banks. A new privatization framework was established with the creation o f the Ministry
o f Participation and Promotion o f Investment. For the last six years, privatization has been a priority on
the agenda o f successive governments, with little implementation success, however, due to strong
opposition from trade unions and vested interests. Four major transactions did take place over 20002001; the assets o f the public sector steel-making complex, SIDER, the jewel o f the heavy
industrialization era, were sold to a majority foreign-owned company; a public detergent company
(ENAD) was partially privatized in 2000 with 60 percent Government ownership sold to the Group
Henkel; 52 percent of Government ownership in the capital o f another public enterprise (ENOR), a gold
mining company, were also sold in 2002, and a new cellular telephone license was sold in 2001 to a
private investor for US$737 million.

56.
Reforms in the financial sector focused on establishing the institutional foundation for the
development o f the financial sector. The strategy emphasizes increased f o r e i d p r i v a t e participation in
public banks and the modernization o f the payments systems t o promote efficient financial
intermediation to support growth. Substantial progress has been made over the last few years in
addressing the problems o f the financial sector. These incIuded: (i)
recapitalization o f banks through
cash infusions and treasury securities and official authorization o f banks; (ii)
moving toward the use o f
indirect and market-based instruments for the conduct o f monetary policy; (iii)
strengthening prudential
regulations to limit risk concentration and to provide rules for loan classification and provisioning; (iv)
strengthening o f bank supervision; and (v) ensuring the use o f market-based mechanisms for the
mobilization of domestic financing o f the budget. A total o f 15 private banks operate n o w in Algeria,
over h a l f o f which are foreign; the Government has decided to open the capital o f one o f the six stateowned banks (CPA) to private participation, through an international bidding process. The Government
has also requested a FSAP to help guide i t s financial sector reform strategy in the future.

16

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

57.
The Government has signaled a change in policy to allow private participation in the provision o f
infrastructure services through concessions. N e w laws and regulatory institutions have been approved to
open up the sector to private participation in roads, telecommunications, mining, power, water and
sanitation. N e w laws were passed in 2000 conducive to public private participation schemes in transport.
The private sector i s active in the transport market which has relieved many urban bottlenecks and
created many jobs. Air transportation was opened to the private sector with the entry o f smaller private
companies. The recent attempt to invite foreign investment for the Algiers airport through a concession
was not successful, however, due to the absence o f risk mitigation incentives.
58.
In December 1999, the Government announced a new policy in the energy and mining sectors
aimed, at: (i)improving efficiency while securing adequate supplies to the economy; (ii)introducing
competition; (iii)increasing Government revenues by developing untapped resources; (iv) addressing
environmental concerns; (v) promoting efficient use o f public resources and protecting public interest
and (vi) alleviating the financial burden o f the energy and mining enterprises on public finances. A new
mining l a w was approved, in August 2001, opening up the sector to private investment, allowing free
transfer o f capital and profits, and creating a new oversight institutional structure. The latter clarifies the
mandate o f the Government as policy maker and regulator o f mining activities, which are opened to
private investment. In February 2002, a new electricity l a w was promulgated creating the enabling
environment for restructuring and unbundling the national utility (SONELGAZ), allowing private sector
investment, introducing competition, and creating a commission for regulating electricity and gas
distribution. A separate company for system operations i s being created and SONELGAZ has been
converted into a joint stock company. Several subsidiaries for generation, transmission, and gas and
electricity distribution are in the process o f being created. In principle, the capital o f SONELGAZ
subsidiaries i s open to private investment (provided Government retains the majority), but n o concrete
plans exist to attract private capital. Attempts have been made to attract private investors to a number o f
Independent Power and Water Projects in partnership with the Algerian Energy Company (owned by
S O N A T R A C H and SONELGAZ), but none o f the projects reached financial closure.
59.
A n e w hydrocarbon l a w has been drafted, which clarifies the role o f the state as the policy maker
and regulator, defines the competitive environment in which energy companies-including the state
owned SONATRACH-will operate, and opens up both upstream and down stream activities to domestic
and foreign private investment. However, because o f opposition from trade unions, the private sector,
and several political parties, it remains a draft l a w under discussion.

60.
While comprehensive reforms have been initiated, actual results o n the ground in terms o f
improved efficiency, pricing adjustments, reduced reliance o n Government resources and increased
private sector participation, have been limited. Substantial capital i s required to meet the rapid increase
in domestic energy demand, optimize the use o f indigenous resources for export and increase government
revenues. Energy prices remain distorted and the level o f implicit subsidies i s high (about US$500
million per annum in the hydrocarbon sector only). The planned integration with Europe’s energy
markets will have implications o n energy pricing policies.
61.

A new legal and regulatory framework for a multi-operator system in the telecommunications
system has been established. The Government adopted and published a telecommunications strategy in
M a y 2000, and subsequently enacted a new postal and telecommunications l a w in August 2000. Postal
and telecommunication services have been unbundled and transferred f r o m the central administration to
two distinct companies, operating under commercial law. The Government’s strategy in this area i s to
gradually liberalize all market segments o f the telecommunications and postal services. The capital o f
AlgCrie TClCcom would be opened to private participation in 2004, according to the Government.

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

17

62.
The Government’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development strategy
i s being implemented gradually. The Algerian government opted for a thorough reform o f i t s posts and
telecommunications sector, in order to face the challenges o f the 2 l S tcentury and to guide the country
towards the information society. This reform i s taking place in the context o f increased globalization and
pending Algerian membership in the WTO. The implementation o f the association agreement with the
European U n i o n i s an additional incentive to reform. The ICT industry i s also expected to contribute to
increasing women’s employment opportunities.

B.

Improving the Effectiveness of Public Service Delivery

63.
Improving Administrative Efficiency and Accountability.
T w o consultative committees
created by Presidential orders have finalized their comprehensive reports o n respectively judicial reform
in 2000 and o n the restructuring o f the role o f the State and i t s organizational structure in 2001. The
main reform areas cover: public service rehabilitation, decentralization and strengthening o f local
administrations, the judicial system; public financial management, greater transparency through
increased information on government activities to facilitate public oversight; and deregulation to reduce
incentives for rent-seeking behavior. These initiatives are also driven by the need to adjust the legal and
regulatory framework to: (i)
comply with the requirements o f the fkee trade agreement with the European
Union; (ii)harmonize trade and investment related regulations with the requirements o f the WTO
accession; and (iii)
build a more efficient and reliable judicial system to support the new business
environment. These reports are not yet public and have not been therefore the subject o f a national
debate before Parliament.
64.
In the area o f public financial management, the Government i s modernizing i t s budgetary
processes and public expenditure management. A Bank Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR) was carried out in January 2002. A new Public Procurement L a w was enacted on July 24,2002,
which forms the basis for all future public procurement. The new l a w i s comprehensive and i s an
improvement over the existing 199 1 law.
65.
Improving the effectiveness of social service delivery to support job creation and develop
human capital. While the Government remains committed to financing basic social services (which i s
justified both on equity and efficiency grounds), it i s n o w open to involving the private sector in the
delivery o f these services. I n education, the Government i s aware o f the problems affecting the
efficiency o f public expenditures in education and the l o w returns to education. In M a y 2000, it
appointed a National Commission to explore reform alternatives that would strengthen and expand the
education system while ensuring that it i s financially sustainable. The key reforms that are being
considered across education levels include the following: (i)
reviewing current human resources policies
for basic education (remuneration, evaluation, promotion, deployment and training o f teachers to
improve quality and internal efficiency); (ii)
reviewing current financing mechanisms in higher education
to reduce the share o f public subsidies; particularly those related to student subsistence expenditures
(“Oeuvres Universitaires”); and (iii)developing continuous vocational training programs based o n the
findings of an evaluation o f current programs.
66.
The Government’s health sector reform i s ambitious, technically intensive, and will require
strengthening institutional capacity, in particular updating management and information systems. The
reform includes: (i)
developing a health sector master plan, to include the growing private sector; (ii)
revising existing treatment norms for health facilities and personnel; (iii)
developing and implementing a
contracting system between the Ministry o f Health (MOHP) and Caisse Nationale des Assurances
Sociales; (iv) revising the reimbursement schedule for private health care; (v) reinforcing access t o a
package o f essential health care services - including preventive health care, and contraception; (vi)

18

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

conducting an analysis o f the pharmaceutical sector, including an analysis o f spending on
pharmaceuticals; and (vii) carrying out a National Health Accounts (NHA) study.

C.

Improving Living Standards and Strengthening Social Protection

67.
The Government’s strategy for improving living standards and strengthening social protection
has two components. The first relates to a combination o f interventions designed to improve the
population’s w e l l being (housing, urban water and sanitation, solid waste management, rehabilitation o f
urban sites) and encourage growth in the rural areas where most o f the poor live. The second includes a
comprehensive social protection system (covering active and passive labor market programs; health, oldage and unemployment insurance; and assistance programs to address both poverty and economic and
social vulnerability).
68.
Housing. The main priority o f the country in the housing sector i s to provide affordable housing
to all segments o f the population, in particular to l o w income earners, and reduce the fiscal burden o f the
housing subsidy o n public resources, while maximizing employment generation, through: (i)
shifting
from a supply-driven, public sector dominated to a demand-driven, market oriented housing strategy, and
(ii)
refocusing the public sector role o n formulating and implementing sector policies that encourage
private sector involvement in the housing sector, including land development, housing construction and
real estate development; (iii)
developing the housing finance market to enable demand, particularly from
the middle class; and (iv) subsidizing housing to l o w income groups while shifting the provision o f such
housing to private operators.
69.
Water and Sanitation. Given the worsening water crisis in Algeria, the water resources strategy
focuses on expanding water storage, by building new dams and desalination plants. There is, however, a
welcome emphasis o n rehabilitation and improved management o f the existing infrastructure. W h i l e
sizable additional investments will be needed in the sector to overcome mounting service deficits
(especially in wastewater collection and treatment and also in water services), the private sector will be
increasingly called upon t o share in the efforts to redress the situation. T o reduce the critical supplydemand gap, the government has taken short-term measures such as development o f desalinization plants.
A number o f BOT and concessions projects are contemplated in the short and medium terms. A water
management strategy that analyzes access, distribution, and pricing i s therefore crucially needed.
70.
Solid Waste Management. The Government i s in the process o f piloting a framework for i t s
municipal waste management strategy through i t s PROGDES program. The strategy aims to strengthen
institutional capacity for hazardous and municipal waste management. I t has targeted 2 1 municipalities
throughout the country to pilot this initiative. The Government recognizes that success in this area will
require an integrated approach encompassing the institutional, regulatory, financial and technical aspects
both at the local and national level. The participation o f the private sector i s legally grounded in the new
Waste Management Law.

71.

Rural Development and Employment Creation. The Government has made significant progress
in improving the incentives regime for agricultural growth. Agricultural trade and pricing regimes have
been substantially liberalized; only wheat producers receive subsidies. After the f i r s t round o f reforms in
the 9Os, the Government initiated a focused Agricultural and Rural Development Plan (PNDAR) in 2000.
The PNDAR, which i s an integral part o f the Economic Recovery Program (ERP), receives 12 percent o f
the budget authorizations, excluding the water and rural power sectors.

72.
The rural strategy aims to promote an environment conducive to agricultural growth through
sustainable use o f natural resources, more efficient irrigation and decentralized, participatory approaches
that involve beneficiaries in the development process. With a radical shift from the traditional producer
price subsidies, the agricultural and rural development strategy under PNDAR focuses on reducing

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

19

vulnerability and reversing the rural urban migratory flows. The strategy aims at improving agricultural
productivity and growth through investment support, targeting the rural poor, the vulnerable and
unemployed, particularly the young. Improving the efficiency o f water use in irrigation i s also a critical
focus under the strategy, and i s reflected in the incentives for drip irrigation equipment for the economic
use o f water resources.
73.
The Government’s strategy for natural resource management i s part o f i t s growth and poverty
reduction strategy. The strategy aims at reducing vulnerability in the rural areas and reducing
environmental health risks through a better management o f the natural resource base. Rural areas face
serious environmental problems. The critical ones are soil erosion, desertification and desert
encroachment, arising mainly from the over-exploitation o f the resource base through opportunistic
cultivation and grazing o f marginal areas (steppes, nappes alfatigres, forests). The strategy i s being
implemented through the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) endorsed in 2002. The latter i s
the Government’s main instrument through which the implementation o f the country’s environmental
policy i s monitored. The strategic priorities are to improve: (i)
population’s health status and quality o f
l i f e through reduction in the prevalence o f water borne diseases, increased access to water and sanitation,
and improvement in solid and hazardous waste management; (ii)
productivity and sustainability o f the
country’s natural capital through sustainable land and watershed management, using participatory and
community driven approaches, with strong linkages t o agriculture, rural employment, rangeland and
water resource management; institutional reform and system improvement in irrigation; forest
conservation including additional forest coverage; and improved protection o f costal and “oasis”
resources; (iii)
resource use efficiency, through economic pricing, user-based management approaches,
and re-use and recycling, rehabilitation and sustainable management o f water distribution (including
irrigation); and trade facilitation (including improving the efficiency o f ports through dredging); and (iv)
the global environment through on-site biodiversity conservation (natural parks and protected areas);
contribution to the reduction in green house gases through increased reforestation, and better
management o f o i l and gas fields; and elimination o f ozone depleting substances.

A.

PROGRESS SINCE THE FY96 COUNTRY ASSISTANCESTRATEGY

World Bank Retrospective

74.
Implementation of the previous CAS. The last C A S for Algeria dates f r o m FY96. I t was
designed as a transitional one year assistance strategy t o support the massive stabilization program o f the
elected Government o n November 16, 1995. Algeria was then at a crucial juncture in i t s history. The
Bank focused i t s assistance during that transition on helping the Govemment stay the difficult course o f
macroeconomic stabilization while helping to ease the adverse social impact o f the economic and social
crisis arising from the o i l price fall and the severe acts of terrorism. The Bank’s planned support was
built around three key elements: (i)
supporting structural reforms for the transition to the market; (ii)
protecting the poor during the transition through targeted safety net programs; and (iii)
providing external
financing and enhancing the country’s ability to mobilize external resources (with the help o f the IMF,
through debt rescheduling, and joint efforts with IFC and MIGA t o mobilize FDI). The portfolio was
also rationalized with the cancellatiodrestructuring of the stock o f projects contracted during the 1980s
(see Table 3). The strategy foresaw the implementation o f substantial structural and sectoral adjustment
programs, with smaller amounts for social safety net financing.

75,
However, the ambitious reform program scheduled for adjustment support never materialized in
the face o f a succession of policy reversals and lack o f agreement o n their content. In addition, between
1997 and 2000 successful macroeconomic stabilization measures together with a recovery in oil prices
obviated the need for IBRD financing. As a result, the lending program was scaled back to the approval

20

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

o f about two projects per year, focusing on the social sectors (Low-Income Housing and support for a
Social Fund) and rural development (Rural Employment Project).
76.
The Bank Group’s task has been made difficult during this transition because o f terrorism and
the lack o f social consensus on the direction and depth o f structural reforms. Algeria’s Governments
have been historically more willing to reform during the bust than o i l boom years. Deep seated
suspicions from some members o f the Government, the bureaucracy, and c i v i l society regarding the
Bank’s role and mission also played a role in reducing Bank effectiveness on the ground. In 1999,
President Bouteflika’s first Government sought Bank’s support to open the infrastructure sector to
private investment. A seminar on concessions was held and a series o f institutional development projects
were prepared aimed at supporting reform in strategic sectors. The institutional loans included a
Telecommunications TA loan (US$9 million), a Privatization LIL (US$5 million), a Budget System
Modernization TA loan (US$23.7 million); an Energy and Mining TA loan (US$18 million), a Financial
System Modernization loan (US$16.5 million), a Transport TA loan (US$8.7 million) and a Mortgage
Finance TA loan (US$5.5 million). In addition to these technical assistance projects two emergency
loans were approved: the Ain Temouchent Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction loan (US$83.5
million) in 2000 as well as an Urban Natural Hazard Vulnerability Reduction loan (US$88.5 million) in
2002. Overall the Bank’s assistance reflected flexibility and responsiveness to Government’s requests
for support. The assistance over the past few years was in line with the F Y 9 6 k e y priorities. However,
Bank effectiveness has been hampered by a lack o f Government consensus on the reform agenda.
77.
The Bank has supported Algeria’s reform program with analytical and advisory services to
a public expenditure review for
underpin the policy dialogue and guide interventions. These include: (i)
the social sectors in 2001; (ii)

An agreement was reached in mid-2001 to work under an “Interim Program’ (2002-mid 2003) and to
prepare a new assistance strategy, restart policy dialogue through analytical work, and establish a liaison
office in Algiers. The office, headed by a senior Bank staff, has proved crucial and successful in
improving relations, moving the policy dialogue forward, and improving portfolio implementation.

years following a series o f aggressive measures to improve performance through a cleaning up o f an
ineffective stock o f projects contracted during the 1980s. In FY96, with more than 52 percent o f projects
and 71 percent o f commitments “at risk”, Algeria had a high “portfolio at r i s k ” resulting, among other
things, f r o m major deficiencies in the design and implementation o f several projects in the portfolio.
Since then, there has been a clear improvement in performance regarding both the size and the quality o f
the portfolio as well as the Bank’s approach and strategy for portfolio management (see Table 3). In
FY02, the percentage o f projects and commitments at risk were reduced significantly to 15.4 percent and
24.9 percent respectively. However, at the beginning o f FY03, the portfolio deteriorated again. The

Algerian authorities and the Bank took immediate actions to improve portfolio performance. As a result,
two projects have been upgraded to n o n r i s k y status and it was jointly decided to close as scheduled two
projects currently in problem status. These are the L o w Income Housing and Water Supply and
Sewerage projects, which will close respectively on June 30,2003 and December 30,2003.

Since FY99, the country and the Bank have been proactive in ensuring that project management
issues are addressed promptly. This i s reflected by a 100 percent proactivity ratio in the last five years.
Nonetheless, delays in effectiveness and slow implementation are affecting project start up and
fulfillment o f development objectives. Reflecting project implementation problems, the disbursement
performance o f investment loans has been weak since FY97 and w e l l below the Region and Bank's
averages. W h i l e the FY02 disbursement ratio improved to 18.2 percent; i t i s s t i l l below the FY02 Bank's
average o f 20.6 percent. The annualized ratio for FY03, based o n the performance o f the first ten
months, i s at 10.6 percent.

81.
The Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) has assessed the quality o f the Bank's supervision
efforts and reviewed nine projects in Algeria since FY97. Overall, QAG rated 69 percent o f supervisions
as satisfactory. The three assessments, carried out in FY99 and FYOO resulted in a 100 percent
satisfactory rating while the assessment carried out in FY03 (the Rural Employment Project) received a
highly satisfactory rating.
82.
Since FY97, the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) reviewed 16 projects in
Algeria. Sustainability was likely in only 27 percent o f them while only 56 percent o f projects had
satisfactory outcome (between highly satisfactory and moderately satisfactory). The performance o f the
Bank was rated satisfactory for quality o f supervision in 67 percent o f projects and satisfactory for
quality at entry in 69 percent o f projects. The performance o f the borrower was rated satisfactory for
preparation in 81 percent o f projects, 57 percent for compliance but only 38 percent for implementation.
83,
Satisfactory outcomes, sustainability, and institutional development impact are highly correlated
with implementation arrangements (see B o x 3). The institutional capacity o f the implementing entities,
their autonomy, the coordination with line ministries when the implementation o f sub-components i s
decentralized to the provinces, the continuity o f project staff, and the speed with which disbursements are
made all contribute to performance outcomes.

The m a i n factors that affected the effectiveness

insufficient
capacity and familiarity with Bank procedures;
(iii)
insufficient communication and coordination
both between the Bank and the Government and
within the Government; (iv) frequent project
staff changes; and (v) focus on inputs and outputs
rather than o n desired outcomes and impact.

Box 3: Bank's Assessment Through ICR Evaluations
Key Lessons Learned

Govemment's ownership needs to be confirmed prior to
loan effectiveness and be sought throughout the project,
from identification to completion.
Project design and scope need to be adjusted to the Algerian
environment and constraints better accounted for during
project preparation. I t i s important to design projects jointly
with the relevant Government institutions and in line w i t h
their implementing capacity.
Project implementation units should, from the start, have an
adequate skills mix and be familiar with Bank guidelines to
support project implementation, and the Bank should
provide and invest in fiduciary training prior to project
effectiveness.
Closer attention should be paid by the country and the Bank
to the monitoring system to be put in place for each project
to evaluate i t s performance indicators and its impact.
Setting up an effective M&E system i s crucial to efficient
project implementation and sustainability and should take
place at the very beginning of the project.

commitment and motivation. The CPPR recommendations are w e l l aligned with those o f the OED
reviews (see B o x 3).
87.
The Bank will strengthen the use o f quality at entry and readiness filters as i t s main instruments
to better assess project preparedness and address the recurrent issue o f effectiveness delays and very slow
start o f the implementation phase. In supervision, the Bank will intensify i t s supervision efforts in order
to improve project implementation, institutional capacity building and the development impact o f Bank
lending. In this context, the Bank will continue to focus on strengthening institutional capacity for social
and environmental risk mitigation. The main instrument to that effect will be the environmental impact
assessment decree that has been revised under the Industrial Pollution Control Project. The Bank will
also use country environmental perfonnance assessments and training to strengthen Algeria's Safeguards
procedures and bring them in line with those o f the Bank.
88.
Collaboration in managing the portfolio will intensify between the Bank and the country through
regular participatory Country Portfolio Performance Reviews. Reviews will take a results-focused
approach in order to tackle the systemic issues and promptly address project specific issues. The Bank
will also ensure that technical and advisory support i s provided in the course o f project supervision.
Benchmarks and standards will be agreed upon to assess the effectiveness o f procedures and processes
(both in the Bank and in Algeria) relating to the Bank-financed program. Although intensive and close

23

portfolio management i s expected to continue to be carried out from Washington, it i s expected that the
Bank liaison office in Algeria, which was opened in January 2002, will be progressively strengthened to
play an increasingly important role in portfolio management, program implementation, and close and
continued dialogue with project implementation units. Going forward, the office will enhance i t s
information sharing activities, including more dissemination o f reports and more interaction with civil
society.

I F C Retrospective

89.
Algeria became a member o f IFC in 1990, which was relatively late in comparison to other
middle income countries. During the early 1990s, the country’s security and political situation, as well as
the Government’s lack o f commitment to liberalize the economy were not conducive to attracting I F C
investments via local or foreign partners. IFC’s first investment in Algeria was in FY93-a US$10
million loan to Helios, a petrochemical company. By end o f FY99, IFC’s total held portfolio in Algeria
amounted to only US$7.7 million, comprising a US$4.7 million outstanding loan to Helios and two
equity investments in the financial sector-Arab
Banking Corporation o f Algeria (US$2 million), and
SociCtC GCnCrale d’AlgCrie (US$l million). IFC’s activities in Algeria expanded significantly following
the improvements in the political, security, and macroeconomic environments as well as the
Government’s early efforts at liberalizing the economy at the turn o f the millennium. As o f April 30,
2002, IFC’s net committed portfolio in Algeria i s US$58.6 million. Investments include a US$20 m i l l i o n
guarantee o f a trade enhancement facility, and a US$35 million loan to the f i r s t private sector cement
company in Algeria (Algeria Cement Company). Although IFC has not approached the market potential,
as indicated by the size o f the economy, these are IFC’s largest investments in Algeria so far and
demonstrate that a higher scale o f business i s possible. IFC’s portfolio has performed well. IFC’s
competitive position and comparative advantage in Algeria remains strong due t o the perceived country
risk and l o w levels o f private sector development. During the last C A S period, several pieces o f
analytical work and technical assistance were provided to the Algerian Government and business
community in the areas of S M E support, investment climate, micro-finance, housing finance, and leasing.

Projects that have benefited from MIGA’s guarantees in the past include one in the o i l and gas sector,
and one in the banking sector. There i s further interest from investors in MIGA coverage for investments
in the o i l and gas, manufacturing and telecommunications sectors. Algeria can also benefit from access
to MIGA’s online investor information services, which provide a vehicle for disseminating information
on the investment climate and business opportunities in the country.

Overview o f Bank Group Strategy

9 1.
The government o f Algeria i s engaged in a program o f far reaching reforms for a transition o f the
country to growth and prosperity. These reforms cover a broad spectrum o f political, institutional,
economic, and social issues, are complex and need to be sustained over the long-term to produce the
results required for support from the various stakeholders. The main goal of the Bank Group’s
Partnership i s to support these fundamental reforms through a program o f analytical and advisory
services, institutional capacity building, and demand driven lending, and/or risk mitigation through
structured loans, hedging products, and guarantees. The IFC will assist Algeria with investments and a
strong focus on demand-driven TA and advisory services (see Annex Ifor the Bank Group’s PSD

strategy). Based on the consultations with civil society and discussions with the Government, Algeria
has three key development challenges: (i)
how to use i t s o i l and gas reserves for the long-run benefit o f
the Algerian population; (ii)
h o w to create growthljobs in the non-oil economy to both benefit f r o m the
surge in the size o f the labor force over the next decade and avoid the social tensions that would be
caused by increased unemployment; and (iii)
how to provide better public services so that all Algerians
are able to participate in and benefit from a twenty-first century market economy. Bank Group priorities
for strategic support mirror these challenges: (i)
support to fiscal sustainability and hydrocarbon revenue
management within an overall asset liability management framework; (ii)support to removing the
constraints to private sector-led growth, particularly those affecting the business environment, SMEs, the
financial sector, and infrastructure development; and (iii)
support the Government’s efforts to articulate
and implement a strategy for better service delivery, particularly for water supply, housing,
environmental services (municipal waste management), and social protection to meet the critical needs o f
i t s population.

the

Experience with

The acts o f terrorism and security concerns, particularly in the early 1990s, limited travel and
closer interactions with the client. The Bank’s lack o f presence in the field limited i t s
effectiveness. Learning from this experience, the Bank established a liaison office in Algiers in
2002 to be closer to the client and better support the Government’s development strategy.
Bank support for reforms needs to pay more attention to the time involved in implementing
reforms, t o properly account for capture by vested interests and their capacity to delay reforms,
and to the country’s implementation capacity. In time, the possible establishment o f a full
country office may help to deepen policy dialogue with the Algerians and improve Bank
Group’s effectiveness through a program o f technical assistance and advisory services.
Algeria, for the most part, does not need IBRD lending but it does need global knowledge and
technical expertise to guide i t s transition t o a market-based economy. The Bank needs therefore
to mobilize cutting edge expertise to contribute to development outcomes and remain a relevant
partner in Algeria.
There i s a direct relationship between the Bank’s effectiveness and i t s knowledge base. The
Bank was most effective when i t had credible expertise to offer which the client saw as added
value.
The effectiveness o f past Bank support was also inversely related to o i l price movements. There
was more receptivity to reforms during the bust than boom years. The Bank i s therefore focusing
i t s dialogue and support to encourage the Government to isolate economic management and
structural reform implementation from movements in o i l prices.
The Bank needs to improve i t s dialogue with the Government o n Bank guidelines and fiduciary
responsibilities in order to reduce delays and other transaction costs by helping the clients
develop effective safeguards and fiduciary systems for public expenditure, procurement, and
financial management. These are the areas where the client sees the cost o f dealing with the
Bank as high.
The IFC also needs to work more closely with local private sector groups to build their capacity
and provide term financing.

Consultations and their impact on strategy formulation. A series o f consultations were
94.
organized to seek the views o f the major stakeholders o n Algeria’s medium-term development challenges
and opportunities; on priorities for this CAS; and Bank Group support (see B o x 4). These consultations
gave participants the opportunity to learn more about the Bank Group’s mission in Algeria and make
suggestions for the future. Participants were critical o f what they called the Bank’s “orthodoxy and lack
o f compassion”. They stressed the need to continue this dialogue o n Algeria’s development challenges

26

and the Bank Group’s partnership with the Algerian Govemment and civil society on a more regular
basis (see Annex II).

The overriding message from these consultations was participants’ requests for more voice both

The Bank Group’s strategic program will be centered o n analytical, advisory, and financing

99.
Areas for Base Case Engagement. While cooperating with other donors, the Bank Group will
take the lead in supporting the Government’s conceptualization o f the reform agenda and ways to address
it. Hence, the Bank will respond to windows o f opportunity as they arise. These will include at first
areas where there i s current Government demand for support-managing o i l price volatility and fiscal
sustainability, supporting reforms to build a friendly business environment, including support to financial
sector development and ICT, and social protection. Under this scenario, the Bank Group will focus on
core diagnostic services, policy advice, knowledge sharing, limited IBRD lending or guarantees focused
o n capacity building, demonstration effects, and reducing market risk aversion. This support will be
complemented by IFC’s advisory services and financing and leveraging the resources o f WBI to play an
advocacy role to encourage reforms.
100. Areas for High Case Engagement The Bank Group will scale up i t s engagement in areas where
the Government has expressed demand for support, has shown the strongest commitment to reform, and
has demonstrated such commitment through measurable actions. Under this scenario, the Bank will
deepen and widen i t s areas o f engagement. In this case, the diagnostic and analytical services will
develop into programmatic approaches to respond to Government’s demands once there i s a clear
indication that the Government i s ready to move rapidly the implementation o f reforms that are critical to
the growth and poverty reduction agenda. These could include support to the restructuring o f the public
enterprise sector, including banking reforms, capital market development, public sector management,
water management, and education and health sector reforms.
Programmatic Approach

101. Algeria i s at an early stage in i t s transition to a market-based economy. Accordingly, the
Government’s reform program i s comprehensive and covers the political, l a w and order, institutional,
regulatory, economic, and social areas. These reforms are inherently long-term in nature and can
therefore be more effectively supported by a programmatic approach o f analytical and lending services
(with multi-year programs at the national level first followed by those at the sub-national levels when the
Algerian government i s ready to implement i t s decentralization strategy). The Bank Group’s ability to
leverage progress o n the growth and poverty reduction agenda lies in i t s support for the policy and
institutional reforms to encourage broad-based growth, led by the private sector, institution building, and
social development. The Bank proposes therefore a menu o f instruments aimed at delivering knowledge
to inform public policy choices and building capacity with flexible lending. These are:

Advisory services from the World Bank’s Treasury to help the Algerian Government build i t s
o w n capacity in selected areas o f public financial management such as asset management, public
debt management, risk management and middle-and back-office organization and operations.
New IBRD Financial Products. Financial products to be used to support Algeria’s development
strategy could include: (i)
traditional IBRD lending as needed; (ii)
intermediation or guarantee o f
long-dated derivatives transactions to enable the Government to better manage foreign exchange,
currency, or commodity risks in i t s liability portfolio; (iii)

o f political risk guarantees in support o f eligible new direct foreign investment, to increase
investors’ comfort in investing in Algeria; and (iv) IFC financing and technical assistance or

advisory services. These instruments can support private transactions in areas such as water
supply, infrastructure concessions, and port improvements; the Bank Group (IFC and MIGA,
W o r l d Bank Treasury, and Project Finance and Guarantee Department) will work with the
Government to help structure an optimal portfolio o f IBRD financing f r o m a cost and risk
perspective, taking into account the government’s existing liability portfolio and the available
alternative sources o f finance.

Partnerships and Outreach

102. The Bank has built stronger partnerships with the IMF and other development partners in
support o f the government’s stabilization and structural reform program (see Annex In). Given the
limited resources and the need to enhance effectiveness o f client support, the Bank will continue to be
selective and to specialize in areas where it has a comparative advantage. There i s already a clear
arrangement between the Bank and the IMF for support to Algeria’s reform program. The Bank-Fund
collaboration on the FSAP will provide a strong foundation for a broad-based partnership for the
diagnostic o f financial sector issues as well as monitoring o f progress. The Bank will take the lead in the
dialogue o n social, structural, and other sectoral issues and fiduciary assessments while leaving core
macroeconomic and related structural issues t o the IMF (such as support to monetary policy
management, strengthening o f central bank’s oversight capacity, tax and tariff reforms). UNDP has
entered into partnership with the Bank and the Government o n the investment climate assessment. U N D P
i s leading the support to the implementation o f the judicial and gender equity reforms and to the
monitoring o f progress in meeting the MDGs Given the importance o f the Association Agreement and
EU assistance, the Bank will seek to reinforce i t s partnership with the EU in order to take advantage o f
the comparative advantage o f each institution. The Bank will also play a more active role in establishing
partnerships with bilateral and other development partners involved in supporting Algeria’s growth and
poverty reduction strategy.
103. Partnerships are also central to IFC’s work, since it i s always a minority investor. IFC will
continue to work closely with domestic and intemational investors in key industries such as infrastructure
and the financial sector to facilitate new investment. I F C will also work closely with domestic financial
institutions to help mobilize long-term domestic financing, e.g. through partial guarantees o f bank loans
or bonds. MIGA can provide non-commercial guarantees for new foreign direct investment into Algeria,
including for privatizations. I F C activities will aim to crowd in private investment. Overall, the
approach i s to invest in, andor guarantee investments in, projects that have a strong catalytic impact in
mobilizing additional private investment, pioneering new opportunities for private investment, or support
new mechanisms for raising finance.

104. Outreach and Knowledge Sharing. The Bank Group’s outreach activities need to be
strengthened significantly over the CAS period. Accordingly, the Bank has increased i t s interactions
with the different levels o f governments, the Algerian media, c i v i l society, and business community to
establish partnerships for Algeria’s development. The Bank Group’s outreach and knowledge-sharing
capabilities will expand further once Algeria develops i t s Distance Learning Center (DLC) as part o f the
Global Development Learning Network (GDLN). The latter, a global “Network o f Networks” on
development issues i s composed of public, private, and non-governmental learninghowledge
organizations. I t i s a fully interactive, distance-learning network with a mandate to serve as a leading
depository o f development-related knowledge. Joining the GDLN will greatly increase the Bank Group’s
outreach and knowledge-sharing activities in Algeria by bringing learning and capacity building activities
to larger numbers o f government officials, private sector representatives, members o f c i v i l society, and
other stakeholders. The Bank will also increase its outreach during the CAS period to help build support
for reforms through a more comprehensive dissemination o f the findings o f the analytical work, and of
the experiences of countries who are undergoing the same structural changes to integrate their economies

are involved in some Bank initiatives such as the Consultative Council o n Gender, the Mediterranean
Development Forum, and the Initiatives on the Laws o f Association in the Arab World. In addition, and
in response to the feedback received during the CAS consultations (see Annex 11), a special effort will be
made to extend the Bank Group’s outreach through more periodic dialogue with stakeholders, The Bank
will continue also i t s highly effective participatory consultative process with local research institutes, and
women’s organizations, on strategic directions for reforms such as those organized o n the ICT, water and
housing sectors.

Program Priorities

105.

Given the selectivity principle and the scenarios outlined above, the Bank Group’s priorities for
FY04-06 are summarized in Table 4 and include (i)
diagnostic and monitoring work to underpin the
dialogue and advisory services; and (ii)
support for reform implementation through advisory services,
technical assistance, risk mitigation instruments, flexible new lending or guarantees, and the supervision
o f the ongoing portfolio. I F C will complement the Bank’s support through financial sector development,
S M E support, promoting private investments in infrastructure, supporting the Govemment’s privatization
efforts, and helping to improve the investment climate and reduce perceptions o f country risk for foreign
investors. Along with several prioritized direct investments, drawing on lessons from IFC’s experience
in other transitional countries, the Corporation’s activities in Algeria will have a strong focus o n demanddriven TA and advisory services. Particular emphasis will be given to the areas o f S M E support through
the recently established N o r t h Africa Enterprise Development (NAED) facility (Annex I,B o x 2),
privatization support through the Private Sector Advisory Facility, advisory services to the Govemment
on other specific transactions, and the undertaking o f analytical work in sectors such as micro-finance,
housing, and leasing (see Annex I).
The specific activities o f each member o f the Bank Group in the
outer years o f the CAS will be derived from the work program described in this C A S and will be agreed
upon with the Algerian Govemment. Implementation support will be demand-driven and focused o n
activities whose demonstration effect and impact will further Algeria’s drive for sustained growth and
employment creation.

Diagnostic and Monitoring Work

106. The Bank’s monitoring and diagnostic role will be implemented through a series o f Economic
reports, all done in collaboration with Government counterparts and other development partners as
required. The purpose o f this work i s twofold. First, to stay abreast o f economic and social
developments, fulfill the Bank’s due diligence responsibilities, and engage with the Government and
other stakeholders analytically o n the national reform agenda, including the broad range o f the growth
and employment generation issues. The second objective i s to use the Bank Group’s analytical services,
including WBI, to build capacity, f i l l the knowledge gaps in key areas o f reforms, and help the
Government to both articulate i t s reform strategies and strengthen i t s implementation capacity. This
diagnostic work will also provide the Government and the Bank Group with a basis for identifying areas
in which financial support could be required or for scaling up support in line with the recommendations
o f the Bank’s Middle-Income Countries Task Force and the MNA regional strategy. (see Table 4).
107. The Bank’s monitoring and diagnostic role i s already being implemented through dissemination
and follow-up o f the study just completed in collaboration with the Algerian Government o n Algeria’s
medium-term macroeconomic strategy for sustaining faster growth with economic and social stability.
The study i s part o f a series o f analytical w o r k t o underpin the policy dialogue and the partnership with
Algeria. Companion studies include: A private sector development strategy note; and a diagnostic note
on the climate for foreign direct investment in Algeria (FIAS). The findings o f these reports l e d to the
elaboration o f a two-pillar strategy-securing fiscal sustainability and promoting a favorable investment

30

climate for medium-term growth. Over the next three years, the Bank will focus i t s policy dialogue and
advisory services o n the implementation o f the findings o f these studies.

108. In this context, the Bank will focus i t s analytical w o r k on (i)
completing the core diagnostic
activities (PER, CFAA, Poverty Assessment, DPR); (ii)
supporting, in partnership with the IMF, the
macro-economic stabilization program; and improvement o f public expenditure management; (iii)
supporting the development o f the financial sector (see B o x 5) and assisting the Govemment in
designing and putting in place an effective Anti-Money Laundering regime.

31

Algeria County Assistance Strategy

Box 5: FSAP's Focus

The FSAP is carried out jointly with the Algerian authorities. I t w i l l include: (i)identifying risks and vulnerabilities in the
financial system and their linkages with the macro-economy; (ii)
assessing the performance o f the financial system in support of
economic growth; and (iii)assessing key financial sector standards, and implications for financial system stability and
development. In particular:
The FSAP w i l l focus on the financial conditions and prospects o f the banking sector, analyzing the results o f past efforts at recapitalizing and restructuring the public sector banks, discussing the need for additional financial and operational restructuring
o f these institutions and examining the operations and financial condition o f the new private banks and their links with local
business groups. The main objective o f the FSAP will be to improve the operational efficiency o f banks in credit and financial
risk management and credit monitoring and loan recovery as well as on strengthening corporate governance and ensuring arm's
length relations with govemment and dominant business groups. Various options w i l l be put forward for future restructuring
and consolidation o f the banking sector, covering the merits and demerits o f "twinning" arrangements, privatizing public sector
banks, and separating private banks from dominant shareholders and business groups.
T h e second focus o f the FSAP w i l l be on the functioning o f the govemment bond market and public debt management more
generally. This component w i l l address such questions as the issuance techniques used b y the Algerian authorities, the
structure o f the bond market in terms o f size o f issues, benchmarking and liquidity, the extent o f competition among primary
dealers and the role o f institutional and other investors in the market. The FSAP will include proposals for enhancing the
efficiency o f the primary market and improving the liquidity o f the secondary market.

Related to capital market developments, the FSAP will report on recent developments in housing finance, focusing on the
adequacy o f the primary market for originating and processing housing loans, initiatives to develop a secondary mortgage
market and the current state o f the legal and judicial framework supporting housing finance operations. This report will include
policy recommendations for strengthening the efficiency and performance o f housing finance institutions and markets. A
review o f the insurance companies and other institutional investors w i l l also be undertaken. The focus will be on the structure
and performance of insurance companies, their regulation and supervision, and their future prospects, but will also address the
role o f social security institutions in the govemment bond and other financial markets. Proposals w i l l be made for
strengthening regulation and supervision and enhancing the contribution o f institutional investors to the financial sector and
economic development o f the country.
Recent developments in payment systems, focusing on the adequacy o f available payment facilities and on legal and regulatory
issues w i l l also be reviewed. The aim i s to recommend policy reforms for strengthening the efficiency and adequacy o f payment
systems.
The FSAP w i l l also focus on the macroeconomic and financial sector implications o f the accumulation and fluctuations of
hydrocarbon revenues and w i l l address issues in the design o f a savings strategy and the potential use o f intemational hedging
facilities.
An analysis o f the performance o f the enterprise sector, distinguishing between public enterprises, large corporations and SMEs

will also be undertaken. T h e FSAP will report on the financial condition o f the enterprise sector and i t s vulnerability to future

changes in the exchange rate and the level o f interest rates and will discuss access issues o f SMEs to financial services.
Proposals w i l l be made for policy improvements in this area, including the promotion o f efficient credit information networks
and various t w e s o f registers.

109. Another important part o f the diagnostic and monitoring work will be the build-up o f the
knowledge base o n human development policies and programs and social insurance systems. In addition
to the policy dialogue, the priorities would include, as per Government's request, a review o f the current
portfolio o f social protection programs to better match social protection instruments (risk reduction, risk
mitigation, and risk coping) with social risks, and delivery mechanisms (public, private, informal). In
this context, the diagnostic work will focus on: (i)
evaluating the impact o f active labor market policies
(vocational training, wage subsidies, public works, and micro-finance programs) in order to decide which
programs should be adjusted and expanded and which programs should be gradually phased out; (ii)
reviewing current social assistance programs to identify gaps in coverage and overlaps; and (iii)
defining
a policy reform agenda for the current insurance system (pension, disability and death, health and
unemployment) to reduce payroll taxes that impair j o b creation.

32

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

Advisory Services, Technical Assistance, Partial Risk Guarantees and other Financial and Risk
management Products, and flexible IBRD Lending
110.
The Bank Group’s implementation support will be limited and selective under the base case
engagement scenario. In line with Govemment’s requests, the implementation support will be focused
o n the reforms to: (i)support fiscal sustainability, including assistance for public asset and liability
management and government effectiveness; (ii)
improve the business environment, including the use o f
technical assistance, financial and risk management products to help reduce the vulnerability o f public
finances and to foster private participation in the financial, transport, water, housing, and ICT sectors;
and (iii)support to social protection programs. IFC will complement the Bank’s support through
financial sector development, SME support, promoting private investments in infrastructure and
supporting the Government’s privatization efforts.

Strengthening the Basisfor Fiscal Sustainability and Government Effectiveness

111. Fiscal Sustainability The Bank will continue to encourage the Government to further
strengthen the fiscal framework, with the a i m o f better managing volatility and securing medium and
long-term fiscal sustainability, through a three-pronged approach:
0

0

0

De-link public expenditures from short-run movements in o i l prices and design and implement a
strategy to reduce the risks resulting from the volatility in hydrocarbon fiscal revenues through:
(i)anchoring the fiscal framework o n an indicator that i s unaffected by the short-run changes in
hydrocarbon revenues, such as the non-hydrocarbon primary fiscal deficit, measured as a ratio to
non-hydrocarbon GDP; (ii)
implementing a multi-year expenditure planning, based on a rolling
medium-term expenditure framework; and (iii)
using a balanced mix o f structured loans and
hedging products within an adequate asset liability management framework.
Secure the sustainability o f the non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit in the medium and long term. The
main options which are being discussed with the Government could include: (i)
implementing a
savings strategy, in anticipation o f the long-run depletion o f hydrocarbon fiscal revenues and the
concomitant future calls o n the budget; (ii)
implementing a rules-based fiscal policy over the
medium term, with the a i m o f keeping the non-hydrocarbon primary deficit below a sustainable
threshold, while saving excess hydrocarbon fiscal revenues for the future. A prudent estimate o f
the ‘permanent hydrocarbon income stream ” could provide an implementation benchmark for
such a threshold; and (iii)
managing hydrocarbon revenue savings in the context o f an active
asset and liability management strategy, with the aim o f reducing the risk t o public finances.
Following a diagnostic assessment, a priority action plan would be established to structure a
sustainable asset and liability portfolio that could include retiring expensive foreign debt and
managing the hydrocarbon products.
Strengthen the transparency o f fiscal accounts and the role o f the budget as an instrument for
improved medium-term macroeconomic management. The Bank could provide assistance for the
modernization o f the preparation and formulation o f the Budget, in particular by: (i)
helping
establish an integrated Budget framework, including a unified, multi-annual, rolling budget; (ii)
encouraging reforms that promote transparency through a comprehensive coverage o f all fiscal
and expenditure accounts within the budget; and (iii)assisting the authorities in the
consolidation, evaluation, and monitoring o f the contingent liabilities o f the public sector.

112.
In addition to the support to fiscal sustainability, over the next 2-3 years, and if requested by the
Government, the Treasury services o f the W o r l d Bank, would provide advisory services to help the
Government o f Algeria build i t s own capacity in selected areas o f public financial management such as
asset management, public debt management, capital markets financing, investors’ relations, and middle-

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

33

and back-office organization and operations. More specifically, based o n a needs assessment, and
complementing and coordinating with other support currently being provided by other sources (e.g., the
IMF, Banque de France, Banque de Belgique), Treasury advisory services could offer support in the
following areas:
0

Asset Management. This would include: (i)
technical assistance to help strengthen all aspects o f
investment and governance practices along with the management o f operational and market risk
in official reserves, pension funds and/or “heritage” reserves such as petroleum funds; (ii)
capacity building in all aspects o f management o f official reserves, via the W o r l d Bank
Treasury’s ongoing Reserves Advisory and Management Program (RAMP); and (iii)
knowledge
transfer on structuring financial assets that would help in managing the inherent risks in
government finances .
Public Debt Management. This would include: (i)capital markets access and funding
transactions execution; (ii)delivery o f a comprehensive public debt management assessment
pursuant to the Guidelines for Public Debt Management recently developed with the IMF, to help
identify priority needs for improvement in this area; (iii)
technical assistance in public debt
management to help build capacity and meet objectives with respect to cost and risk; (iv)
technical assistance in asset-liability management, with a particular focus on the design and
implementation o f strategies to measure and mitigate foreign exchange, interest rate and
commodity risk in government finances; and (v) technical assistance in the design and execution
o f a government funding program in the international markets, including assistance with rating
agency processes and relationships, design o f a sustainable funding strategy, and management o f
banking and investor relations, and back- and middle-office.

Governance Reforms. The Government i s s t i l l working o n i t s public sector reform and
113.
governance improvement strategy and has not sought Bank support yet except in the areas o f public
procurement and modernizing o f budgetary procedures. Bank support will therefore be focused over the
next three years on: (i)the implementation o f the recommendations o f the Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR), carried out in January 2002, with full Government support; and (ii)
technical assistance in the areas o f public expenditure management and information management through
the supervision o f the ongoing Project for the Modernization o f Budgetary Processes. A Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) i s planned for FY05. The Government and the Bank have
recently started the accounting and auditing review module within the Reports on the Observance o f
Standards and Codes, or ROSC, in order to improve and enhance the quality o f financial reporting within
public interest entities (banks, insurance companies, listed companies, large entities). The diagnostic
review currently under way and the policy recommendations will lay the foundation for a reform agenda
and a concrete action plan in the future.
Improving the Business Environment and Encouraging Private Sector Participation

114. The Bank Group will use the findings o f the private sector development strategy note; and the
diagnostic note on the climate for foreign direct investment in Algeria (FIAS) to underpin i t s dialogue
and advisory services for the promotion o f a favorable business environment for medium-term growth
(see Annex 1 for the recommendations). Pending an agreement with the Government o n the specific
areas o f focus for Bank support, the Bank Group will pursue the dialogue in support o f private sector
development in Algeria through: (i)
encouraging further privatizinghestructuring o f public enterprises;
(ii)
furthering banking reform, including privatization o f banks, and financial market development; and
(iii)
encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure services, including telecommunications.
Attracting foreign private investors to Algeria i s not going t o be easy given market perceptions about
Algeria’s political risk and the global risk aversion to emerging markets. Privatization approaches will

34

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

have to be structured very pragmatically taking into account this market situation and local sensitivities
to privatization o f public sector assets. The Bank Group can play a very important role in this area
through the set o f risk mitigating instruments it could offer in helping to present Algerian risk to the
market, through for example joint road-shows with the Government, advice o n ratings, partial risk
guarantees, and improving the outreach with trade unions on the benefits o f privatization and private
sector involvement in general.

IFC has provided technical support to the Algerian Government and the private sector. For
115.
instance, the recently established North Africa Enterprise Development Facility in Algiers i s geared to
help SMEs develop business skills, receive management training, and increase their access to financing.
IFC i s also negotiating a global advisory agreement o n privatization with the Ministry o f Participation
and Investment Promotion. The Bank Group will therefore continue, through policy dialogue and
advisory services, to support the reform agenda to strengthen Algeria’s integration into global markets
and improve competitiveness. The Association Agreement between the EU and Algeria offers a unique
opportunity in this respect.
116.
The Bank Group will continue to support financial sector development, a major component o f
the Government’s reform agenda and a Government priority area for Bank Group support. Specifically,
over the next three years, Bank Group support will focus o n the implementation o f the recommendations
o f the FSAP report based o n specific requests from the Government. In addition to the priority areas
emerging from the FSAP, the Bank will continue to support the Government through two ongoing
technical assistance projects for financial sector development-The Financial System Infrastructure
Modernization Project and the Mortgage Finance Technical Assistance Project.

117. IFC has already helped to develop many o f the new private institutions in the financial sector
with equity investments in two commercial banks, an investment bank, and a leasing company. IFC i s
expected to support the reform o f public banks with loans and equity participation in the privatization
and attraction o f a solid technical partner for one o f the public banks. As part o f the reforms to develop
the capital markets, the Bank i s supporting the development o f the housing finance system through a
three-year US$5.5 million loan, the Mortgage Finance Technical Assistance Project, which was approved
in June 2002. The project supports the development o f the enabling environment for a well-functioning
mortgage loan market through (i)
reform o f the legal and administrative fkamework to enforce property
rights, mortgage l i e n efficiency, and property titling and registration systems; (ii)strategic technical
assistance tailored to the needs o f targeted banks and other related financial institutions; and (iii)
training
of bank staff to acquire the professional s l u l l s needed in the mortgage line o f business. The mortgage
market, for which a trust-funded IFC study i s under way, micro-finance and the insurance sector could
also provide opportunities for IFC to introduce new products.
118.
Facilitating private sector participation in infrastructure.
The Bank’ s support for
infrastructure will be focused o n the urban transport sector, water and sanitation services, housing,
energy, and ICT. The Bank will continue to support the modernization o f the transport sector through the
ongoing Transport Technical Assistance Project (US$8.72 million) which was approved in August 200 1.
The project supports the formulation o f transport policies, master plans for ports and road transport, a
comprehensive package to reengineer the railway company, and advisory services and possibly
guarantees to support the promotion o f concession schemes mostly related to the port o f Djendjen, the
Algiers subway and airports. Infrastructure presents another area where IFC’s expertise i s needed and
the potential i s significant.
119. Developing transport concessions is crucial for Algeria’s growth prospects. Algeria needs
direct foreign investment and i t s associated technology transfer and demonstration effects, to develop i t s
key infrastructure services. The Bank Group can play a major role in reducing foreign investors
perceived risk for investment in infkastructure schemes, once the authorities take the right steps o n the

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

35

policy reform front. This would include using Bank Group's financing, advisory and risk mitigation
instruments to reduce risks for investors and improve market perceptions. The priorities for such support
could include: (i)
the Algiers subway; (ii)a container port near Algiers; (iii)
construction o f the 1216-km
East-West motonvay; and (iv) privatization o f the road contracting industry, city bus services, air
transport, port services, and non-core railway services.
120.
The recent failure to attract a private investor for the Algiers Airport concession scheme is a
clear reminder that success in this area has prerequisites. The concession framework should be
consistent with international norms. The ebbing o f private infrastructure projects in the world since 1997
calls for a more commercial approach to transport concessions as well as public-private partnerships for
investment financing. The Bank Group could bring valuable support to the conclusion o f transactions by
helping the Government finance i t s share o f the partnerships and by extending i t s partial risk guarantees.
The Bank work o n Output Based Aid could also guide development o f a project to address road
maintenance issues in rural areas where 70 percent o f the poor work and live.

Fostering a transition to a private sector-led development in infrastructure could lead to Bank
12 1.
support to the construction of the East- West motorway. The Government envisaged resorting to private
concessions initially. However, issues ranging from tolling limitations in the near future and the
wariness o f investors about a sector that has under-performed over the last ten years, together with the
current security conditions in Algeria, will necessitate starting construction with traditional external
financing. Once the some 300 km planned are in operation and tolls are gradually raised, private
financing o f the East-West motonvay may become feasible. The Bank could support and hasten
construction o f this first segment, hence paving the way for private schemes that will use the cash f l o w
generated by motonvay sections in operation under the traditional approach, to develop the other
sections, without resorting to public funds. Finally, a technical assistance project to promote
management reforms within the ministry o f public works together with a strong training program that the
new leadership seems intent to introduce better governance in this critical sector.
122.
The Bank will continue i t s support to the Government's I C T reform strategy through: (i)
the ongoing Telecommunications and Postal Sector Reform Project (approved in FYOO, US$9 million) which
provides technical assistance for implementing the first-generation ICT reforms (establishing a new
postal and telecommunications regulatory framework; liberalization entry - 2"d G S M license awarded in
2001, and third license forthcoming; creation and institutional support to AlgCrie Poste (AP), AlgCrie
TClCcom and the regulatory authority (ARPT); partial privatization o f AlgCrie TClCcom); and (ii)the
proposed ICT Development Support Project (FY05) which aims at supporting the second-generation
reforms agreed with the Government (strengthening o f the regulatory framework to develop an
information society; transforming A l g t r i e Poste (AP) into an e-commerce enabler, supporting selected egovernment flagship applications, and institutional development support to Algiers Technology Park
(incubation services, incentive mechanism for R&D, ICT training, capacity building for SMEs to use ICT
in supply chain management)). I F C could potentially support A l g t r i e TClCcom prepare for privatization
through financing and advice or help other private operators enter the market.

Improving Public Service Delivery

123. Developing human capital and strengthening social protection. The Bank is expected to
support the Government's education, health, and social protection agenda. The Bank has prepared in
partnership with the Government a review o f public expenditures in the social sectors (FY02) and i s
ready to engage with the Government o n enhancing the efficiency and quality o f public service delivery
in the education, health, and social protection sectors and o n broader sector reform issues once the
Government i s ready to seek Bank support. Accordingly, over the next three years, the Bank will
continue i t s dialogue o n the social sectors (Health, Education and Social Protection) through sector work
and continuous dialogue.

36

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

124. I n water and sanitation, the Bank will continue to encourage the Government to clarify i t s
priorities for the sector and prepare a sustainable development strategy which the Bank Group could
support through a menu o f instruments. These could include: technical assistance; investment lending; or
a guarantee facility to help the Government attract the private sector to help finance and manage specific
segments o f the sector. The facility would. help identify and advise o n the viability o f BOT and
concession projects. There i s already an interest from foreign investors for investment in water. The
Bank and/or I F C services could help private interest into investments. There i s n o w a window o f
opportunity t o actively pursue the dialogue with the Government o n the immediate agenda o f reforms
which include: (i)
stabilizing water supply networks by rehabilitating the networks to reduce losses; (ii)
corporatizing the utilities with an appropriate level o f financial and managerial autonomy, and increasing
tariff levels t o cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs; and (iii)
introducing the private sector in
O&M in the form o f lease or performance based management contracts. Water i s a sector where IFC
could get involved in the financing o f BOTS or public-private partnerships for the existing systems in
large cities or properly structured water desalination plants.
125.
I n housing, while support to the policy reform on housing finance continues through the ongoing Housing Finance TA Project, a broader reform agenda has been identified and discussed with the
authorities in the context o f the CAS preparation. The Bank will support this agenda through: (i)
advisory services to assist in designing and implementing action plans t o move forward the strategic
reforms o f the sector; (ii)
technical assistance, and if needed, financial support, to pilot alternative
approaches to address priority policy reforms for land management and public-private partnership in land
development; (iii)support to develop the local debt/mortgage market, and (iv) I F C technical assistance
and/or investment to help develop the mortgage finance institutions.
126.
Strengthening natural resource management. A Bank assessment o f the National Environment
Assessment Plan (NEAP) was discussed at the Board o f Executive Directors in June 2002 (Report #
22890-AL). The assessment proposed a strategy to support the implementation o f the NEAP which will
be guided by the key operating principles o f the MNA Regional Strategy and will include the following:
Sharing knowledge with support from the Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance
Program (METAP) to build local institutional capacity for understanding the externalities
between energy, trade policies, poverty, and the environment; and (ii)mainstreaming
environmental concerns into high impact strategic lending in water and waste-water; municipal
services through the Solid Waste Management Project planned for FY05; and the Second Rural
Employment Project for North-Central Algeria (FY 03).

Improving public Sector efficiency and governance and encouraging public sector investment in
projects with significant environmental benefits (water and waste water, irrigation). Support will
be provided through the Solid Waste Management Project in which the capacity of municipalities
will be strengthened both technically and in the area o f financial management and cost recovery.
The ongoing Industrial Pollution Control Project (PCP) will also help strengthen the
management capacity o f environmental institutions and agencies.
Encouraging an environmentally sustainable private sector development strategy through the
planned Technical Assistance under METAP and PCP.
Supporting the formulation and implementation of a water management strategy focused o n
quality, sustainability of resource use, economic efficiency and equity. The region’s water
advisory program; the ongoing dialogue with the Government o n i t s water management strategy,
and the planned rural development strategy (FY04) will be the main instruments.

Strengthening Government’s capacity for harmonizing environmental and social safeguards
policies with the Bank’s policies by developing a structured learning program aimed at building
in-country capacity for upstream integration o f environmental considerations in the planning and
decision making processes

127.
Given that the Bank’s support to Algeria, over the next three years, is principally a knowledgesharing partnership with a strong capacity building element, the role of W B I is very important.
Algeria’s policy makers need knowledge about h o w other countries have successfully navigated their
development challenges and opened-up to the world. Information on h o w to tailor international good
practice to Algeria’s circumstances i s crucially needed. In this context, WBI will work closely with the
Government to design and implement a knowledge and capacity building strategy for Algeria. For
example, there i s already a request for support t o the newly created water management company
(Algkrienne des Eaux, or ADE). The Bank Group will engage the Algerian Government o n the medium
and long term fundamental issues related to water resource management, including decentralization
issues, and the role o f the private sector. There i s also a strong demand to develop a multi-year learning
program to support banking restructuring and Central Bank’s capacity in partnership with the “lnstitut de
Financement du Dkvelopment du Maghreb arabe in Tunisia.
”

128. WBI will also use i t s existing program and course offerings to strengthen Government
implementation capacity and enhance sustainability o f knowledge sharing through partnerships with local
researchknowledge centers. WBI, in partnership with the MNA region, could also support a GDLN
Center in Algeria, should Algeria choose to j o i n this network. This will expand Algeria’s access to
knowledge not only through courses and other learning events via W B I ’ s increased use o f web-based
information services, but also by accessing the vast global network o f Distance Learning Centers and
other partner learninghowledge institutions which have turned the GDLN into the world’s leading
“Network o f Networks” o n development-related learning. The specifics o f the WBI program in the
context o f the implementation o f this C A S will be agreed o n with the Algerian Government.
129.
Criteria for support. The Bank Group’s program will be highly selective over the next three
years based o n Government requests and priorities. The Bank Group will review these priorities with the
new Government following the April 2004 presidential elections. The following criteria will guide
country programming choices and determine entry into new areas o f engagement or exit from current
engagements.
0

0

0

A link to policy reform. Linking Bank support to the country’s key development priorities i s
critical. Particular importance will be given to ensuring a strong link to policies supporting the
establishment o f an enabling environment for private sector development, employment
generation, and poverty reduction.
Explicit Government ownership. The Bank will engage only in areas where there i s explicit
request and concrete upfiont signals, and an agreement with the Government.
Bank Group’s comparative advantage. The Bank will provide support only i f i t has a particular

international expertise.

130. Scaling up Bank Engagement. M o v i n g t o a high case scenario o f analytical and advisory
services will depend o n progress in implementing the reforms under the base case scenario. Under such
scenario, the Bank will be ready to scale up i t s engagement and agree with the Government o n an
expanded and deeper program of programmatic diagnostic and advisory services which will be carried

38

out through a Country Development
Partnership, with the possibility o f cosharing the costs o f some o f the expanded
services between the Government, the Bank,
and other donors (see B o x 6).

Scaling down Bank Engagement.
Lower demand for Bank services over the

engagement to a program o f analytical and

areas where there i s Government demand and

Box 6: Cost Sharing for Analytical and Monitoring Work

The Bank Group’s diagnostic and monitoring work does not rely on
direct financial contributions from the Government with the
exception o f the FIAS report (where Government’s financial
contribution was paid for through a trust fund). However indirect
cost sharing b y the Govemment (and some cases other partners
such as UNDP) i s an integral part o f the diagnostic and monitoring
work. The analytical work is driven by Government’s demand.
There are no stand-alone or ad hoc analytical and advisory services
outside o f those agreed to with the Govemment. The Govemment
identifies the relevant institutions and puts in place counterparts
teams to work jointly with the Bank Group team. This approach
has been adopted for the following work:

T h e Investment Climate Assessment where teams from
different ministries and agencies in charge o f the promotion of
private sector development took part in the work and
validation exercise for the survey results on the investment
climate. LJNDP financed part o f the cost o f the survey.
The evaluation o f the Government’s Economic Recovery
Program.
The Public Expenditure Review o f the Social Sectors.
T h e Government and the Bank are expected to put together
teams to update the 1998 Poverty assessment.

discussed above. If circumstances change, including sharp and sudden falls in o i l prices, or if the
Government requests additional financial support beyond what i s planned in the base case scenario, the
Bank would consider such a request a prepare a CAS Progress Report for Board discussion.

Evaluation and Country Program Monitoring
133.
The effectiveness o f Bank Group support to the Government strategy can be judged ultimately by
Algeria’s progress towards achieving sustainable growth and achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Given the swings in past Bank Group involvement in Algeria, the lack o f a national
consensus on a reform program, and the uncertainty related to the upcoming Presidential election, the
prospect for demonstrating results in the short-term i s limited. The C A S aims to keep the Bank Group
involved and lay the basis for accelerated reform in the future.
134.
Given the political economy considerations and the demand-driven nature of this CAS, it is
proposed to have a simple evaluation and monitoring framework. The t w o broad areas which the Bank
Group will be supporting are fiscal sustainability and improving the business environment. The quality

39

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

o f the policy dialogue in these two areas o f support will be measured by the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG). The impact o f this policy dialogue will be measured through an assessment o f the policies which
will be put in place and the steps taken to implement the reform agenda for example for the proposed
asset-liability management framework. There will be n o specific indicators as the focus i s o n
engagement. However, there will be a number o f instruments which would help monitor results. These
are: (i)client surveys conducted during the implementation o f this C A S to seek client feedback on
Bank’s effectiveness; and (ii)performance o f the portfolio (through the CPPR exercise) which would
show Government and Bank track record in implementation. If the 2004 elections lead to greater
consensus o n the need for accelerated reforms and greater clarity regarding a Government program, the
FY05 C A S Progress Report would provide an occasion to elaborate a stronger results-based framework
for the reminder o f the C A S period.

wr. RISK

MANAGEMENT

135.
Algeria’s economy faces many development challenges and risks emanating from a variety o f
internal and external sources. W h i l e Algeria’s strong external position positively impacts credit risk
when taking a short to medium term view, the country’s weak commitment to structural reforms, the
existing political and social problems, and the economy’s hydrocarbon dependency remain important long
term risk factors. There are, therefore, two main risks associated with this CAS.

136.

Thefirst and most important risk is that the Government might further lessen its commitment

to reforms due to political opposition or complacency arising from the favorable prospects for future

oil prices:
0

0

0

With Presidential elections scheduled t o take place by April 2004, there i s unavoidable
uncertainty about the sustained implementation o f the limited reform agenda outlined in this
CAS. There i s a clear risk that the Government might slow down the implementation o f the more
politically sensitive reforms. The Government has had t o delay the discussion o f i t s o w n reports
o n public sector and education reforms, the laws on hydrocarbons and land ownership because of
political opposition. Trade unions have also staged a general strike against the Government’s
privatization program.
Strong political pressure to relax the Government’s fiscal policy stance and current social
tensions. The Government has been pressured by trade unions and other stakeholders t o spend
the current o i l windfall on increased welfare programs and public investment in infrastructure
and housing. Reserves are offering the various vested interests an opportunity to reverse the
1990s liberalization trend and move toward a public sector led growth strategy again. The
Government has so far been able to balance macroeconomic stability with the pressures to
stimulate the economy through a fiscal expansion. But the risk remains that as elections near,
there will be more temptation to spend and endanger the fiscal stance which painfully restored
macroeconomic balances in the mid-1990s.
High oil prices and levels of international reserves may lessen the drive to improve the
investment climate to attract foreign investment n o w that international reserves are rising and
seem likely to continue to rise over the C A S period. High international reserves and an election
year might also lessen the pressures to deepen the reforms o f the public enterprises and banking
sectors.
The Bank Group i s managing this risk by focusing on analytical and advisory services to help the
Government build a strong rationale for reforms through dissemination and consultations about
the benefits o f reforms based o n results both within Algeria and elsewhere, and by supporting the

40

Algeria Country Assistance Strategy

Govemment’s social protection strategy. T o the extent that IFC’s expanded engagement in the
country depends on improvements in the investment climate, privatization, and increased private
investment, renewed instability in the country or reversal o f reforms would therefore negatively
affect IFC’s program. IFC intends to manage this risk by helping the Government structure
socially acceptable solutions for the privatizations in which I F C will be involved.
137.
The second risk relates to the financial risk to the Bank. Given that Algeria i s not expected to
need significant financial support from the Bank over the CAS period, the proposed lending program i s
modest and would allow for a continued decline o f IBRD exposure in line with the reduction o f Algeria’s
external debt obligations. IBRD exposure stood at US$1.3 billion at end FY02, down from US$2.1
billion at end-1996. All IBRD exposure guidelines are currently met. However, the share o f preferred
creditor debt service in total public debt service comes close to the 35 percent guideline threshold. While
the financial risks to the IBRD are limited over the short-to-medium term, the country risks (potential
continued violence, social tensions, pressures to relax the fiscal stance, and lesser commitment to
reforms) and the vulnerabilities o f the Algerian economy to o i l price movements are important. The
Bank Group i s managing these risks through the planned advisory services to: (i)
manage Algeria’s
vulnerability to o i l price vulnerability as discussed in the CAS; (ii)improve public debt management;
(iii)encourage a faster implementation o f the structural reform agenda to improve the business
environment to encourage a private-sector led growth to reduce unemployment, the root o f much o f the
social tensions; and (iv) reduce Algeria’s sovereign risk through advisory services and use o f risk
mitigating instruments and IFC’s financing and support.

ANNEXI:PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
I.DEVELOPMENT
AND PROFILE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR
Historical perspective - the gradual rise of a private sector. Even when marginalized by
1.
government policy, Algeria’s private sector has always existed. Since independence in 1962, the
government pursued a centrally-planned economic strategy, which translated into massive public
investment, particularly in industry, construction, agribusiness, banlung, infrastructure and foreign trade.
Private enterprises suffered from discriminatory measures, including limits o n their investments, inability
to import outside the State’s trade monopoly system, and very limited access to credit from banks (those
lent almost exclusively to public enterprises). However, beginning in the mid-80s, the government
engaged in a gradual change o f economic policy, moving toward a market-based economy. This
transition made possible the resurgence o f private enterprises. Graph 1 below shows the distribution o f a
random sample o f 600 Algerian f i r m s based on the year o f creation. Roughly h a l f o f the f i r m s were
created before 1990 and have grown under the socialist era, a peculiar feature o f the Algerian enterprise
sector which greatly affects i t s slow transition to a market economy, and the behavior o f most
entrepreneurs.

2.
During the period o f central planning, the private sector managed to survive in the niches l e f t
uncovered by public enterprises, particularly in the poorly capitalized, high-profit sectors where demand
was not being met. Thus, private enterprises were able t o dominate the sectors o f retail commerce,
services (restaurants, small hotels, computers), land transportation, tailoringhosiery, finishing work in
construction, processing o f plastics, printing, leather work, hardware, etc. These enterprises generally
supplied, retailed and did subcontracting work for public enterprises (which concentrated o n industry, rail,
maritime and air transportation, and processing o f r a w materials).
The majority o f independent entrepreneurs employed few or n o staff. M a n y other private
3.
enterprises adopted a l o w profile based on family units headed by an owner/founder. These enterprises
operated very flexibly to escape the constraints o f the state, adapted themselves to an unfavorable
business environment and directed their production almost exclusively to the domestic market.
Enterprises often engaged in speculative and sometimes illegal behavior-the
latter particularly with
regard to importing, filing financial statements, and reporting employment and profits. They made little
use o f the banking system. Entrepreneurs o f this period learned to be wary o f the state, o f public
administration and o f the judicial system. In industry, the dependence o n protection from international
competition meant that enterprises had little incentive to innovate and invest in n e w technologies. The

Page 2 of 21

Annex I

private sector emerged from this period in disarray, without i t s own supply and distribution network and
with an insufficiently structured professional organization.

4.
However, the dominance o f the public sector and i t s monopoly o n foreign trade did help private
enterprises in some respect and led to the emergence to what Algerians call a “secteurprive‘ rentier”.
Given the constraints to conduct private business activities, the few entrepreneurs who were able to make
investments o f significant size acquired monopolistic positions in niches, that turned into profitable and
secure rents. The high margins and protection thus acquired reduced their incentives to innovate and seek
other markets.

5.
A recently conducted survey shows that the ‘old’ private sector that has grown during the
centrally planned era or during the burgeoning reforms o f the 1980s, reports different constraints than the
more recently created enterprises. In particular, they are the ones complaining proportionally more about
unfair competition. They also seem to have more access to credit.
6.
Characteristics today: private enterprise slowlyfinding its role. Private enterprises are generally
family endeavors. They are small in size (see Graph 2 below o n the size distribution o f a random sample
of firms). They tend to be under-capitalized and heavily indebted.’ Their management methods are
obsolete, particularly in the fields o f finance, strategy, marketing and human resources. A management
culture has yet to emerge. Dominated by family-based capital and management, enterprises were
reluctant to open themselves up to the outside. With the liberalization o f prices and trade, once highprofit markets became more competitive, drying up economic rents as most were ill-equipped t o deal with
international competition (for example, in textiles, engineering and agribusiness). Movements to transfer,
merge and consolidate enterprises are rare. Acquisitions by foreign f i r m s remain very limited.

7.
Free access to the market is, at present, guaranteed d e j u r e . In practice, private agents have not
yet invested sufficiently in the opportunities that have been created. The importing and supply networks
remain, on the whole, inefficient and trade i s fragmented. The isolation fi-om international markets over
many years and the difficulty in Algeria o f obtaining information o n new technologies have contributed to
widening the gap between domestic and foreign producers. With the movement to a market economy and
rising international competition, Algerian enterprises realized that they had to modernize their production
facilities and adopt a more aggressive marketing approach, including with regard to exports. However,
given the difficult access to credit and the absence o f significant foreign investment, private enterprises
experienced problems in bringing their equipment up to standard. Consequently, they are generally not
very competitive. Their products are often obsolete and the quality mediocre.

Particularly those that invested heavily in the late 1980s, borrowed in foreign currencies and were caught by the
depreciation o f the DA in the mid-1990s.

Annex I

Page 3 of 21

8.
The movement to a market economy and the liberalization o f trade represented two things
simultaneously to many enterprises: a shock but also a scope for extraordinary development opportunities.
M a n y enterprises struggle in the face o f foreign competition, for which they are ill-prepared. Production
capacity i s under-utilized. The absence o f foreign investment does not allow them to modernize (not only
in terms o f equipment but also with regard to management and marketing methods). The transformation
and restructuring o f the sector have yet to be achieved, including the creation o f a true fabric o f small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the formalization o f individuals and enterprises in the informal sector,
the formation o f modern supply and distribution networks, and-except for a few notable exceptions-the
further development o f large private industrial and commercial groups.
Composition of the private sector. Obtaining accurate data on the enterprise sector in Algeria i s
9.
a challenge. For instance, the Caisse Nationale d 'Assurance Sociale (CNAS) recorded 179,893 registered
businesses as o f 1013 1/200 1, while the Centre National du Registre du Commerce (CNRC) recorded
667,200 o f them as o f 12/31/2000 (of which 45,277 were enterprises and 621,923 individual businesses).2
However, for consistency purposes, the composition below i s based o n C N A S figures.

10.
A striking feature o f the Algerian enterprise sector seems to be the l o w density o f businesses
(either self employed or enterprises) compared to the population. Altogether, there i s only one registered
enterprise for 666 inhabitants and one for 48 when self employed are included.

11.
Table 1 clearly shows that the construction and industry sub-sectors are predominant. Commerce
and trade are s t i l l underdeveloped, although it i s likely that many individuals and small f i r m s are
operating informally in these sub-sectors. Among enterprises registered at the CNAS, 95 percent have
less than 10 employees. These very small f i r m s (less than 5 employees) employ 44 percent o f all labor
registered at the CNAS. For the whole enterprise sector, the average number o f employees by firm i s
only 4. Based on C N A S data, there are only 518 private enterprises with more than 100 employees.
However, regular inspections made in 2001 by the Labor Inspectorate at the Ministry o f Labor over a
sample o f 7,779 enterprises showed that 41.45 percent o f employees were not properly registered at the
CNAS3. Different figures from other sources evaluate the proportion o f non registered labor between 35
to 45 percent.

12.
Geographically, enterprises are concentrated along the coast. Algiers i s by far the most important
economic center with 28 percent o f registered enterprises (CNRC data), followed by Oran (7 percent) and
6 Wilayas accounting for between 3.6 and 4.3 percent o f the total (Setif, T i z i Ouzou, Chlef, Constantine,
Bejaia and Blida). Only 11 percent o f enterprises are located in the South. Another characteristics i s the
limited role of women in business (at least in registered businesses). Only 10,5 percent o f businesses
(self employed as well as enterprises) belong t o women. Regarding the judicial form of registered
enterprises, only 3 percent are joint-stock companies, 53 percent are limited responsibility companies and
the rest are partnerships or single owner f i r m s . As in many other developing countries, Algerian
businesses are small family affairs, mostly closed t o outside investors. There i s not a single private
enterprise listed o n the Algiers Bourse des Valeurs, because Algerian entrepreneurs would not share
equity and control with other investors outside their family or a small circle o f trusted friends.

The CNRC (the trade registry) registers a l l enterprises and individuals involved in an economic activity. The
CNAS registers enterprises and individuals employing staff liable to pay social security charges. The DGI registers
tax payers. The data discrepancy i s explained by avoidance o f the rather high taxes o n employment as w e l l as a
large number o f registered but n o n active entities. The ONS keeps an important data base o n economic activities.
Other data bases are kept by the Ministkre de la PME-PMI, the Chambers o f Commerce and Industry; and
specialized agencies, such as the Direction des Douanes (customs), PROMEX, CAGEX, etc.
This number should be used with care as micro-enterprises and fm f r o m the construction sector, where most
unregistered employees work, are more frequently visited by the Inspectorate, so that average may w e l l be
overestimating the true percentage o f employees w h o are n o t registered.

The ONS has prepared rather elaborate comparisons o f the performance between public and
private enterprises over an 11-year period, from 1990 to 2000. The main conclusions can be summarized
as follows:
0

M o s t o f the value added o f the public sector came from hydrocarbons. Without hydrocarbons,
private enterprises have been generating more value added than the public ~ e c t o r . While
~
the
value added o f public enterprises (without hydrocarbons) stayed flat after 1995, it kept growing
steadily in the private sector. Over the same period, they generated-hydrocarbons included-an
average added value o f 54 percent, against 46 percent by the private sector. In 2000, the private
sector created 78% o f value added, outside hydrocarbons. Private enterprises were much more

However, public enterprises s t i l l generate more value added (on aggregate) in some industrial sectors (mechanical
industries, building materials, chemicals, paper and wood).

Page 5 of 21

Annex I

0

In the early 1990s, public enterprises were paying more than double the aggregate wages paid by
the private sectors. Starting in 1996, the total amount o f wages paid by the private sector
progressively caught up with public sector wages. By the end o f year 2000, they were about
equal’,

With the exception o f the year 2000, private enterprises always generated a higher operating
income (on aggregate) than public enterprises. Actually, detailed ONS data shows that most
operating income o f the public sector was generated by the energy and hydrocarbon sub-sectors.

In several sub-sectors+.g.
mechanical industries, textiles, ago-industries, leather and shoes and
services-public
enterprises were regularly loss making. With the exception o f textiles in 199394, the private sector never showed a loss in any sub-sector over the entire 11-year period.
Public enterprises were large consumers o f fixed assets. Over the 11-year period they consumed
an average o f 78 percent o f fixed assets against only 22 percent by the private sector.

14.
In sum, in spite o f all discriminatory measures, private enterprises appear to have generated more
jobs, have been more efficient and more profitable than public enterprises. Eventually, the total amount
o f wages they paid exceeded those paid by public enterprises. The trend i s also worth observing: while
public enterprises were stagnating and are n o w beginning to disappear, the private sector kept o n growing
in spite o f the severe problems i t faced during that period (security, depreciation o f the DA, strong
informal competition, unfavorable environment, etc.).
11. K E Y CONSTRAINTS TO PSD
15.
While some improvements have occurred over the years which have helped increase the private
sector’s share in the economy, the poor overall investment climate prevailing in Algeria has adversely
affected the country’s ability to attract sufficient FDI, especially in the non-oil sector, as well as crowded
out private sector investments. In addition to governance problems, an inability to implement structural
reforms to alleviate the key constraints to PSD (identified below) have frustrated investors for years. The
slow pace o f change i s due to resistance to change from those who stand to lose or for ideological reasons.
Higher o i l prices also contribute to delaying the needed structural reforms.

16.
The investment climate survey conducted among 600 f i r m s in nine Wilayas, together with the
interviews done by F I A S o f 56 potential European investors, convey a sense o f the main constraints
identified by investors-whether private, public, foreign, or local firms. Overall, there appears to have
been a recent shift from constraints resulting f r o m an economy o f shortages, towards one o f constraints to
growth, which probably reflects regained optimism among investors, but calls for urgent and deep
structural reforms to reduce them. The main constraints to PSD identified in the surveys and WBG
experience are:
17.
Public Sector Control of Economic Activities. Algeria’s long legacy o f a centrally-planned
economic strategy where the public sector played a strong and active role in the economy i s s t i l l visible
today where large parts o f the economy are under public dominance or control. The most obvious o f this
i s the financial sector, where 95 percent of the market i s captured by public sector banks. Similarly, the
hydrocarbon sector, infrastructure, and some industries continue to be fully dominated by the public
sector. In this context, the governance issues associated with a large public sector apparatus have resulted
in several barriers to entry for local and foreign private f i r m s . A lack o f strong Government commitment
to liberalize the economy on par with other middle income countries, including countries like Jordan in
the region, continues to hold back the development o f Algeria. The foreign perception o f Algeria i s
negatively affected by the perceived hesitations in implementing structural reforms, particularly the
privatization program and the heavy bureaucracy which controls tightly many economic decisions such as
business registration and exchange controls. Other issues that pose particular concern for foreign
However, unit wages are s t i l l much higher in public enterprises (about double).

Page 6 of 21

Annex I

investors include the practical impediments that they often face in transferring royalties or dividends
abroad, in spite o f a clear guarantee o f transfer in the Algerian legislation; or the negative attitude and
restrictions to foreign investment in the service or distribution sector. There i s a remnant o f old socialist
thinking which does not value service industries highly. There i s little recognition o f the value-added
provided by modem distribution systems that will create jobs, improve quality control, and more
importantly, introduce efficient logistics to a largely disorganized sector, and contribute to improvements
in upstream production and investment..
18.
Shortage of Industrial Real Estate. This i s an increasingly severe constraint. There i s a large
unsatisfied demand for industrial land. Out o f the 600 f i r m s surveyed in 2002, 38 percent have been
looking for a plot o f land, for a period o f time o f almost five years o n average, to invest and expand. At
the same time, around half o f equipped land i s unused, either because it belongs to bankrupt public
enterprises or because private owners are holding on to them to speculate. The State-dominated land
market6 exhibits large-albeit diminishing-price differentials which fosters speculation and corruption;
and non-transparent distribution. There i s a severe titling problem. Lastly, existing industrial parks and
activity areas are poorly equipped, serviced and managed.

19.
DifJicult Access to Finance. Access to credit i s difficult, time consuming, and unreliable. In the
random sample o f 600 f i r m s w e surveyed, only 11.4 percent o f their working capital financing needs were
financed by bank credit over the last three years. Bank financing accounts for only 18% o f total
investment financing by Algerian f i r m s which use internal cash generation for 71% o f their needs. Large
private f i r m s have easier access than SMEs (46% o f investments financed by banks vs. 16%). Overall,
only 29% o f loans are given to the private sector compared to 71% for the public sector. Banks-the
largest are s t i l l state-owned-are bureaucratic, not business-friendly and poorly equipped. Credit officers
are not trained to assess risk or serve smaller private sector clients, and they have little incentive to take
responsibilities or manage risk. The “Performance Contracts” signed with the public banks following
their recapitalization a i m at separating the management from the ownership o f the public banks, and thus
could be a step towards improving bank incentives to actively seek new market niches. However, the
transparency o f these “Performance Contracts” i s open to question, as i s their effectiveness in
permanently altering the incentives for public bank lending to state-owned enterprises. On the business
side, economic information i s scarce and unreliable, only 53% o f private companies have audited
accounts, credit history databases inexistent, and many S M E managers lack the qualifications to present
sound business plans. The judicial system i s slow, unreliable, and s t i l l dominated by judges lacking
knowledge o f commercial matters; making it difficult for banks to credibly secure collateral. Private and
foreign banks and other financial institutions (leasing, venture capital) are s t i l l weak and only play a
minor role in financing enterprises. The payment system i s extremely slow and encourages cash
transactions even for large amounts, thereby discouraging savings mobilization. 50% o f broad money i s
held in cash. Lastly, export financing facilities (export credit, guarantees) are very limited and
inadequate. Capital markets are undeveloped and there i s little availability o f non-bank sources o f
financing. Leasing i s nascent, the stock exchange i s moribund and bond markets undeveloped and tightly
controlled.
20.
Administrative Barriers and Access to Information. The positive change in Government policy
toward the private sector did not translate yet into significant change in the attitude o f the public
administration (see graphs 4 and 5 below). Entrepreneurs s t i l l face unfriendly bureaucratic behavior, red
tape, cumbersome and opaque regulations and endless delays to obtain clearances and authorizations.
Although evidence i s hard t o produce, corruption i s also said to be rife, possibly spurred by the
administrative barriers and cumbersome procedures that make service delivery by the public sector slow
and unreliable. Barriers are pervasive in all areas o f business activity. Most frequently mentioned are the
procedures to: clearing imported goods through customs, in particular through Algiers’ harbor; obtaining
a building permit; registering an enterprise; etc. Tax harassment i s also frequently mentioned. These
While dominated by public land, the land market i s actually dual and there i s a private market for land.

difficulties are compounded by difficulties to access information, such as applicable laws, regulations and
procedures to specific cases, statistics, market information, etc.

Inefficient & Cumbersome Taxation. Overall, direct taxation levels are about average compared
to other countries. This is, however, negated by a series o f additional taxes o n turnover, imports, etc,
which increase the overall tax burden. This i s compounded by a complicated system o f tax incentives that
adds to confusion and administrative discretion. In addition, social charges o n employment are very high
and discourage j o b creation. The cost of employees born by businesses exceeds 130% o f gross salary and
i s higher or o n par with much more advanced countries such as France and Sweden.

22.
Inadequate Infrastructure. Firms often have poor access to services rendered by public utilities,
and the quality i s reportedly low. The services considered to pose the most significant problems are
connection to, and maintenance, o f fixed-line telecommunications, access to water supply, harbor services
and management o f industrial parks. The density o f telephone mainlines i s quite l o w at 57 per 1000
people in 2000 (table 3), and this ratio has failed to significantly increase in the last 10 years. Tunisia and
Egypt, with a similar teledensity in the early 199Os, outstripped Algeria by the end o f the decade. The
slow growth o f mainlines in Algeria i s partly due to the limited ability o f the public monopoly to satisfy
growing demand. Mobile phones have started to make inroads into the Algerian market, and the recent
sale o f a G S M license may remedy this situation. Transportation or access to energy are not regarded as a
major problem.

Legal and Judicial Issues. The Algerian legal framework i s progressively being more attuned to
the requirement o f a market economy. However, i t i s far from functioning smoothly because o f the
shortage o f qualified commercial judges, the lack o f disclosure o f court's decisions and understanding, by
the business community, of methods that proved successful in other market economies (e.g. collateral
legislation; bankruptcy; alternative dispute resolution). Also, there i s limited trust within the business

community in the impartiality o f the judicial system. I t i s s t i l l widely seen as slow, inefficient, impartial,
corrupt and best avoided.

24.
Shortcomings in Labor Regulations and Few Skilled Workers. Labor costs are fairly low but
are offset somewhat by l o w productivity. There i s a lack o f good intermediary staff, such as factory
foremen and skilled workers, and, as importantly a general lack o f skills in n o n technical management
areas critical to a market-oriented economy (management, finance, marketing, strategy, etc.). There i s a
strong demand for training. However, the Algerian education system does not meet enterprises’ needs
and post-education training and consulting services remain below standards and under-developed,
Enterprises also suffer from excessively high social security charges and from cumbersome and expensive
labor regulations.
111. RECENT POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
AND PRIORITIES FOR GOVERNMENT
A.

Recent Policy Developments

25.
Amidst a difficult domestic political environment, Algeria has made considerable progress in
establishing macroeconomic stability and achieving significant economic liberalization. Some recent
initiatives include: (i)liberalization o f the mining, electricity, and telecommunications sectors, and
establishment o f regulatory bodies in each o f these sectors; (ii)
strengthening o f the legal and judicial
framework for private sector development with a new Investment Code, the creation o f an Investment
Council along with the Agency for Investment Development, and a one-stop investment window (ANDI);
(iii)
promulgation o f two new decrees clarifying further the privatization policy and process as well as the
creation o f the Ministry for Privatization and Investment Promotion; and (iv) substantial progress in price
and trade liberalization, most prominently tariff reductions in keeping with the Association Agreements
with the EU (AAEU) signed in 2002 and the ongoing negotiations for WTO membership. W h i l e progress
o n privatization has been slow in general, four major transactions did take place over 2000-2001; the
assets o f the public sector steel-making complex, SIDER, the jewel o f the heavy industrialization era,
were sold t o a majority foreign-owned company; a public detergent company (ENAD) was partially
privatized in 2000 with 60 percent Government ownership sold to the Group Henkel; 52 percent o f
Government ownership in the capital o f a gold mining public enterprise (ENOR) were also sold in 2002,
and a new cellular telephone license was sold in 2001 to a private investor for US$737 million.

B.

Priorities for the Government

26.
Structural reforms are key. Reducing the constraints to enterprise development cannot be done
successfully in a piece-meal manner. The experience o f the transition economies in Eastern Europe bears
n o ambiguity to the importance to pursue rapid reforms o n many fronts, in order to send strong and
credible signals to investors. Addressing the constraints described above and launching the corresponding
reforms simultaneously should form the basis o f the Government strategy to increase investment in
Algeria in the medium-term.
27.
To be implemented effectively, this set of reforms will call for strong political will, ownership
and dedication from various parts of the Government; significant expert resources; management
capacity and senior officials involvement and monitoring. The Government would need to focus o n the
following strategic priorities to ensure that the Algerian private sector has the opportunity to burgeon to
full potential, as well as attract further foreign investment into the country (see the matrices starting on
page 15 for details):
28.
Establish market discipline on public enterprises and foster the privatization agenda.
Structural reforms for enterprise development call for a fundamental redefinition o f the role o f the State in
the functioning o f the economy. In Algeria and elsewhere, it i s n o w admitted that the State should have a
limited role in the production o f goods and services. However, Algeria has made much less progress in
overcoming the-much more difficult-double challenge o f successful second generation reforms for

Annex I

Page 9 of 21

private sector development, which consist in (i)
increasing the State capacity to regulate markets; enforce
decisions; ensure a level playing field among all participants; provide strong, effective and reliable public
services and market institutions (customs, tax authority, judicial system, anti-trust agency, the
administration etc.); and (ii)
reducing the State intervention in areas where private operators should
progressively take over: the land and credit markets; the provision o f services to enterprises; the provision
o f infrastructure; and the production o f goods and services that do not exhibit public good attributes. In
particular, the latter calls for accelerating a transparent privatization process based o n a well defined legal
framework, and enforcing market discipline on the “old economy”.

29.
This i s the single most important area that has affected the quality o f governance and weighs
heavily o n the perception o f the investment climate. In addition to public sector reform and acceleration
o f privatization, the Government o f Algeria (GOA)might want to consider other actions that will increase
the visibility o f the country and improve foreign investor perceptions: (i)seek a sovereign rating to
establish a benchmark, increase visibility, and, eventually, lower financing costs for the public and private
sectors7; (ii)establish a regular forum for dialogue with private investors (domestic and foreign) to
discuss areas o f concern t o the private sector and increase transparency o n the formulation o f policy (see
B o x 1); (iii)
change the weekend days to benefit from greater integration in the world economy given the
recently signed agreement with the EU and pending WTO adhesion8.
30.
Reform the institutional set-up of the industrial land markets to increase supply of land slots at
market rates. The supply o f available public land needs to increase significantly and the current dual land
market be unified. The whole institutional set-up o f industrial land development and management needs
to be reviewed, including a greater involvement o f private actors to ultimately limit the State’s
involvement to i t s regulatory function. I t will also be important to foster private participation in
development and management o f industrial parks.

3 1.
Accelerate the comprehensive reform of the financial sector. The weaknesses in Algeria’s
financial sector i s severely constraining the private sector’s ability to access financing and increase i t s
activities in the economy. Hence there i s an urgent need to reform the financial sector, especially through
privatization o f some o f the prominent state owned banks and insurance companies. I t i s also important
to foster judicial reform (e.g., collateral legislation, bankruptcy laws etc.), and improve access to reliable
market information and credit information systems as well as valuable business services for SMEs.
32.
Reduce administrative bottlenecks and improve access to information services. Some reforms
are already underway and should be scaled-up (ex. customs, tax authority), but major efforts o f
simplification and e-enabling o f administrations are needed. Some o f these, including facilitating
enterprise registration, faster business creation, and improved access to information, should materialize
via the ongoing roll-out o f ANDI.
33.

Simplijj the tax system and gradually reduce average rates while eliminating incentives that
have not demonstrated their efficacy in increasing investments. The various fiscal and social charges on
payroll should also be reduced to encourage j o b creation.
Improve access to quality infrastructure. Access to quality infrastructure has significantly
34.
improved in other countries-often at reduced cost-by
opening-up the sectors to private operators.
Building o n the transport and mobile phone experiences, Algeria should move in the same direction for
ports, airports, power, and water. Management and maintenance o f infrastructure in industrial zones
should be handed over to private operators in the short-term.

Most comparator countries in MENA are rated (Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and
Tunisia).

Box 1: An Investor Advisory Council for Algeria

The Government o f Algeria may want to consider the development o f a small, high-level business-government “Investor
Advisory Council” (IAC) to support its objectives. T h e purpose of an Investor Advisory Council would be to reinforce
implementation o f investment climate reforms, by providing an investors’ perspective on the establishment o f clear priorities
and on results-oriented management of reform. An effective Investor Council can help pinpoint priority areas for change,
suggest solutions based on practical investor experience, and help create an atmosphere o f greater trust by providing a
recognized and transparent platform for dialogue. Ultimately, an effective Investor Council will motivate actions in the policy
arena, and eventually new investments.
Business-government consultative mechanisms designed along the lines of Investor Advisory Councils exist in many emerging
economies, where they have had some noted successes. In Eastem Europe for example, Foreign Investor Advisory Councils
established in the last decade have been credited with leading to lasting policy reforms in Russia and Kazakhstan. While the
institutional approaches, composition, agenda, outputs and ultimately impact o f every Council differs, lessons have emerged
that provide insight into what makes an effective Investor Council, and the common approaches that can be considered as best
practices in their development.

.

An Effective Investors’ Advisory Council would..
Be a direct channel of dialogue between investors and a country’s political leaders, at the highest possible level on
both sides;
Be relatively small, with approximately 15 business leaders, drawn from the top echelons of intemational businesses
working in Algeria, o f intemationalbusinesses not currently invested in Algeria, and of Algerian businesses
Be chaired by H.E. the President o f Algeria, with approximately 5 other government ministers selected to participate
Convene once or twice a year for one-day meetings
Be a business-led process that involves year-round engagement through a working group structure that maintains
follows up on issues between meetings
Be concemed with Algeria’s opportunities in the global economy
Proactively seek to identify obstacles to investment and propose solutions that benefit investors collectively
Have a fairly limited r e m i t to ensure tangible policy reforms
Build on existing local institutional structures and capacities

-

Investor Advisory Council Added Value
Added Valuemniqueness of Investor Council Proposal T h e primary added value of the Council i s the face-to-face
interaction between decision makers who set policy and those who control investment, and the follow-up implementation that
derives from the working group structure. T h i s enables govemments to gather information to design more realistic and efficient
policies with inputs from the private sector, while providing investors with a more informed perspective on the policy priorities
of the country. Such consultation helps to enable stakeholders from business and govemment to take joint responsibility for
policy choices and economic results.
An Investors’ Advisory Council adds value by:
Adding the perspective (leadership, management and investment) o f a group of intemational business leaders to key
elements o f Algeria’s strategy to stimulate growth and private investment;
Making recommendations for concrete measures that have the potential to increase Algeria’s attractiveness as a
location for international capital and domestic investment, and helping ensure implementation of those
recommendations;
Ensuring follow-up on recommendations, through a working group structure;
Providing increased intemational visibility for Algeria’s progress in creating an environment conducive to global
investment.
Empowering and elevating the participatory level o f existing consultative mechanisms on which it would draw.
NEXT STEP: Should the Government o f Algeria be interested in exploring the development of an Investor Advisory Council,
the next step should be an assessment led by the World Bank, with the Government of Algeria, in full consultation with IMF,
IFC and MIGA.

Improve the legal and judicial system. In the short-term, there i s a need to speed-up the
35.
implementation o f the judicial reform o n commercial matters, in particular the setting-up o f independent

Page 11 of 21

Annex I

commercial courts. As important i s the need to urgently scale-up the ongoing training program o f
commercial judges to a much larger number o f beneficiaries.

36.
There i s a strong need also to: (i)
strengthen competition policies and significantly reinforce the
anti-trust agency; (ii)
increase transparency and competitiveness o f public procurement policies to create
a level-playing field between all enterprises, whether public or private; and (iii)create an enabling
environment for informal companies to formalize. For the longer-term, Algeria is in need o f an ambitious
and credible anti-comption strategy.

37.
Create a labor force that is geared to a market economy. In the long-term, reform o f the
education system-in particular at secondary and university level-should be geared towards greater
adequacy o f skills to market demand. M o r e urgent would be the reform o f the system o f professional
training centers-in particular in management, by greater involvement o f the private sector and selffinancing mechanisms' that would insure training responds to market needs.

WORLD BANKGROUP
STRATEGY

World Bank Strategy

38.
The pieces o f analytical work which underpinned this country assistance strategy" have helped in
outlining a program o f short-and-medium term reform agenda to improve the investment climate and
encourage private sector development (See policy matrix attached to this annex). Bank support could
include technical assistance and advisory services, policy dialogue, or risk mitigation instruments.
Consultations with the Government o f Algeria over the coming year will help specify the areas for
support which are expected to focus o n the following areas ":
Reform of the industrial land market, which could include institutional reform; land market
regulation; rehabilitation and titling programs; fostering private participation in the development
and management o f industrial zones;
Reduction of the administrative barriers for firm registration and investment. This could
include support t o the development o f the network o f one-stop-shops (ANDI), i t s processes and
organization, i t s linkages with other institutions and i t s information network.
The development of a national market information system. This would include support to the
ongoing Government program o f building a sound and reliable information system o n companies
and sectors. I t could involve support in the design o f the system and the linkages between various
institutions (ONS, CNRC, ANDI, CNAS, Ministries, Chambers o f Commerce and Industry, etc.),
as well as the design o f the downstream mechanisms to supply the information t o various market
stakeholders, which would involve public-private partnerships.
Support the ongoing reform of the judicial system that pertain to commercial matters. This
could include support to strengthening legislation and legislative policies, in particular o n
commercial l a w and economic regulation issues"; strengthening legal institutions; strengthening
legal education and the ongoing program o f judges training o n commercial matters; the
development of Alternative Dispute Resolution; etc.

B.

IFC Strategy

39.
Along with the W o r l d Bank, the I F C will assist the Algerian Government in addressing several o f
the strategic priorities listed above. The IFC will draw o n i t s comparative advantage and lessons o f
experience working with private sector partners in other transitional countries. For instance, in both
Vietnam and Russia, I F C devoted the bulk o f i t s efforts to TA and advisory services. Lessons from IFC’s
experience indicate that for successful overall results in such transitional countries, i t i s important to have
both a strong client demandpolitical will for IFC services and advisory efforts, as w e l l as an improving
investment climate. Prioritization o f TA services to achieve strategic goals, as w e l l as working in close
coordination with the W o r l d Bank in soliciting and using donor TA finds, especially in relation t o
financial sector and investment climate activities, are other lessons IFC will draw upon when designing
interventions in Algeria. Along with several prioritized direct investments, the Corporation’s activities in
Algeria will have a strong focus on demand-driven TA and advisory services, particularly in the areas o f
S M E support through the recently established North Africa Enterprise Development (NAED) facility
(Box 2), privatization support through the Private Sector Advisory Services, advisory services to the
Government o n other specific transactions, and the undertaking o f analytical work in sectors such as
microfinance, housing, leasing etc.

40.
As the lessons o f experience have shown the importance o f a strong investment climate, I F C will
work in parallel to help improve the business environment by encouraging private participation and
assisting the Government to improve perceptions in international markets. In this context, I F C will put
specific emphasis in the following areas:
Successful privatization i s crucial to the development o f a healthy private sector. The
Government has asked for IFC’s help in this area. I F C i s negotiating a global advisory agreement

with the Ministry in charge o f privatization and will also help increase investor confidence with
pre- and post-privatization financing and advice.
Financial sector development i s also a priority area. IFC has already helped to set up many o f the
new private institutions in the financial sector (with equity investments in two commercial banks,
an investment bank, and a leasing company). I t can also help the government to tackle the
broader area o f reform o f the public banking sector through convertible loans designed to
accelerate the privatization o f one o f the public banks and attract a solid technical partner. The
mortgage market, for which a trust-funded IFC study i s under way, microfinance, and the
insurance sector could also provide opportunities to introduce new products.
Encouraging private participation in infrastructure presents another area where the need for
IFC’s role and expertise i s great and the potential business i s large. Promising opportunities are
in power, transport, water, and telecoms. Inpower, IPPs are scheduled for award in the future. In

telecoms, IFC could help Algeria Telecom, the incumbent public company to prepare for
privatization through financing and advice. Water i s a sector where shortages are fuelling unrest
and disrupting the normal functioning o f the economy. IFC could get involved in the financing o f

BOTSor public-private partnerships for the existing systems in big cities or properly structured
water desalination plants.
IFC will strive to Strengthen the Local Private Sector through relaying concerns and constraints
to private sector development and strengthening prominent local groups with financing and
advice.
Support for SMEs i s a joint priority o f the Govemment and IFC. The newly established NAED
i s developing a program o f TA and advisory services and helping opportunities for IFC’s
investments (see B o x 2).
Help improve management skills. IFC i s actually pursuing a project that would help finance one
of the first private business schools.

Box 2: Algeria North Africa Enterprise Development (NAED) Facility
In June 2002, the Board o f Directors o f the World Bank Group approved the participation and contribution o f the
IFC to the North Africa Enterprise Development (NAED) facility. T h e Governments o f Switzerland, France, Belgium,
and Italy are contributors to this new initiative which i s managed by IFC, and covers Algeria, Egypt and Morocco. T h e
Facility’s core objective i s to support the development of the SME sector in these countries. This will be achieved by
complementing the ongoing government and donors SME programs. The Facility i s expected to be in full operation in all
three countries by July 2003.
In Algeria, NAED i s co-located with the World Bank office in Algiers. It operates under the existing
Establishment Agreement between the WBG and the Govemment of Algeria (GOA). The NAED office was officially
inaugurated in September 2002 through the signing o f a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between IFC and the
GOA. NAED’s activities in Algeria to-date have focused on surveying Business Associations in the country, conducting a
preliminary assessment o f a leasing company and investment funds, and launching a market assessment of microfinance,
including a review of the regulatory framework. Future activities under the Facility will include:

.

Improving SME access to finance: provide advisoryltechnical assistance to private commercial banks and nonbank financial institutions in developing products geared towards SMEs; help develop viable micro-finance

activities; and strengthen the SME finance training programs o f local banks.

Supporting intermediary organizations in business development services: develop capacity building partnerships
with active business associations, management training institutes, and consulting firms; provide training in areas

o f business management and administration; and organize an export seminar geared towards SMEs.

.

Providing direct assistance to small and medium-sizedfirms: through selected auditinglconsulting firms, deliver
technical assistance and advisory services in areas such as financial management, MIS, restructuring of
organizations etc.
Improving the business enabling environment: review the legal and regulatory environment affecting small
businesses in Algeria including exports.
Strengthening the supply chain linkages between large$rms and SMEs.

ANNEX11: CAS CONSULTATIONS
1.
A series o f consultations were organized on the priorities for this joint BanWIFC CAS. A dozen
consultation workshops organized between January 2002 and April 2003 drew together over one thousand
participants from a broad range o f backgrounds.
Consulting on Algeria’s Development Challenges and Priorities for Bank Group Support
The intent o f the Bank consultation was to enable Bank Group staff to hear directly from people
2.
about their concerns and their expectations. The following priorities were underlined :
Reduced poverty and exclusion, both social and economic;
Greater economic growth leading to more jobs and wealth;
Improved education and capacity building;
Better access to affordable and suitable housing, in particular in urban areas;
Better water management to put an end to the shortages;
M o r e transparent and responsive form o f government;
Greater participation and increased ability to have a voice in policy decisions; and
Increased attention to gender issues.

3.
Sectoral workshops allowed in depth discussions on macroeconomic issues, private sector
development, public sector performance, ICT, housing, water and rural development. Discussions were
also held o n the role the W o r l d Bank has played in the past and could play in the h t u r e to help support
economic growth and poverty reduction in Algeria.
Poverty and Exclusion

4.
The findings o f the consultations point to a concern that the Algerian population i s becoming
increasingly vulnerable. There was a general concern that poverty and social exclusion are o n the rise and
that the gap between haves and have-nots (“fracture sociale”) i s growing. The main factors advanced are:
persisting violence in the country, structural adjustment programs (referred t o as “instruments o f
exclusion”), globalization and the opening o f the Algerian economy, and l o w economic growth. I t was
observed that liberalization and devaluation had an extremely high social cost without engendering the
positive outcomes that had been promised.
5.

“Social exclusion” was referred to much more often than “poverty” in the consultations. The
multiple facets o f exclusion in Algeria have been stressed and, the main groups suffering from exclusion
being the poor, the unemployed, women and youth. One o f the main challenges that Algeria has to face i s
fighting these various forms of exclusion in order to reduce vulnerability and empower these social
groups to play an active and productive role in society. The following factors were listed as necessary
conditions to reduce exclusion:
Greater economic growth;
Growth supported by pro-poor policies and targeted programs for excluded groups;
Better understanding o f the dynamics o f poverty and vulnerability, in particular the characteristics
o f the vulnerable groups, their coping mechanisms and the factors that impinge o n their ability to
cope;
Increased access t o social services that cut across socio-economic status, gender, age and
geographical location t o address related inequities;

Page 2 of 8

e
e

Annex I1

Greater attention to the demand side o f interventions to identify the economic, social and cultural
factors that impinge o n the ability o f the vulnerable groups to access resources and services; and
Improved mechanisms to reduce poverty in rural areas, including ensuring food and other basic
needs at adequate levels, and to enhance the inclusion o f rural societies in terms o f access to
resources and services.

Greater Economic Growth

11.
A great emphasis was put o n the need to spur economic growth. There was a strong feeling that
insufficient analysis has been conducted to understand the causes o f the slow growth, and that future
growth will not be possible without a consensus on the causes o f past failure. Questions were raised o n
the link between the slow growth and possible shortcomings in the diagnosis, the design o f policies, or
their implementation. Links were also made between disappointing performance o n factors specific to
Algeria, such as the way institutions and governance function.
12.
The Algerian economy has been described as a rent-seelung economy in which powerful interest
groups such as the o i l industry, various monopolies, political powers and some social groups protect their
interests. The urgency for moving toward a more open, dynamic and competitive economy was stressed
as a priority, but the question was, how? H o w to manage the transition t o a new form o f economy and
ensure consensus around the reform agenda? H o w to share the rent in a fairer and more equitable way?
The private sector emphasized that for growth to pick up in Algeria, the business environment needs to be
greatly improved to give both public and private enterprises more liberty o f action. This was echoed by
many participants at the April 2003 consultations. The latter discussed the options proposed in two Bank
Group’s reports: the medium-term strategy for sustainable for sustainingfaster growth with economic and
social stability, and the private sector development strategy. They insisted o n the need to create a
conducive business environment for both private and public enterprises.
To enhance growth, the private and the rural development sectors identifed thefollowing main
10.
areasfor development:
Reforming banking and financial sector, legal and judicial system including land tenure, and
transparency in economic and administrative decisions (“the rules o f the game”);
Promoting private Infomation and Communication Technology industry, namely o n
services;
Specifying which sectoral improvements are expected by the adoption and diffusion o f
Information and Communication Technology to build an Information Society; the effort
would lead to the definition o f a comprehensive e-Algeria strategy;
Favoring sustainable development relying o n an environmentally sound use o f natural resources
and guided by market-based economic principles;
Diversifying agricultural and rural productive activities that would be susceptible to employment
creation, and to encourage private sector-led development in agro-industry in an integrated
manner with local production o f primary products and r a w materials;
Assessing social, political and institutional constraints to growth.

Education and Capacity Building
Education was identified as a cornerstone for development and poverty reduction. A major
8.
concem was that the education system i s not sufficiently open to new ideas and i s not building the s k i l l s
required for the knowledge economy. The need to rethink education to enable it to better respond to the
new needs o f the Algerian economy was emphasized. According t o the participants, the reform of the
education sector, in particular at the secondary and tertiary levels, should aim towards a better
alignment between the qualifications delivered and the demand for skills from employers.

9.
An Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Symposium held in December 2002
pointed to the need t o reform the Algerian education system and to introduce ICT in the training programs
as soon as possible. There was agreement that any reform o f the education system must include the
diffusion o f ICT as a learning tool and a means o f production, and that systems o f e-learning should be
diffused and used by schools and universities. In parallel to this, the need to train the educators to the
most modern I C T systems and content i s necessary to diffuse updated information and allow for the
development o f a Knowledge Economy. The education system should aim to achieve a learning
environment in which students can use ICT, learn through ICT, acquire a broader technological
knowledge, and communicate with the international environment. Three major actions were identified:
0

0

R o l l out communication networks in all institutes and between them;
Train teachers o n h o w to use ICT and h o w to teach with the help o f modem technologies;
Develop language-specific multimedia content available for education purposes.

10.
Discussions in most workshops pointed to the need to improve capacity of key stakeholders of
the economy: central and local government officials, civil society, professional groups, and private
entrepreneurs. The rural development workshop highlighted the need to improve capacity in the central
and decentralized public administration in agriculture and in professional organizations. In the context o f
the housing workshop discussions were held on the need t o improve the professionalism o f public and
private organizations involved in housing. The private sector consultations pointed to the need t o develop
the capacity o f government officials to regulate the market and create an enabling business environment.
The urgent need to reform professional skills development centers in order to ensure greater participation
from the private sector and, therefore greater alignment with real training needs.
Housing

11.
Housing was identified as an issue o f serious concern in several o f the workshops, and was
analyzed in great depth in the housing workshop which was an opportunity to take stock o f the situation
o f the housing market in Algeria and identify ways to improve housing policies and programs.
Participants noted that although housing i s a stated priority area o f the Government and public spending
in this sector i s substantial, many urban dwellers live in sub-standard housing and wait for years to get
into a new apartment or house. They expressed concern that the situation seems to be deteriorating. With
a rapidly growing urban population, more people - not less - will be living in run-down housing (habitat
pre'caire) in the years to come.
12.
The main bottlenecks limiting the supply of affordable and decent housing in urban areas were
identified as being control of the State over land tenure and construction, lack of housing credit,
limited role of private developers, and inequitable use of subsidies. Whereas it was recognized that the
govemment has several subsidy schemes for housing, it was highlighted that most o f the subsidies, such
as those for leasing (location-vente), go to middle to upper income families.

Water Management

14.
Just as housing i s a topic o f great concern for urban dwellers, so i s water as most people can go
without running water for many days. Water i s also a source o f concern for the rural population who
suffer greatly during periods o f drought when their crops perish and their incomes shrink. Participants in
the water workshop discussed the Government’s sector strategy and i t s proposed actions in the short and
medium terms in order to identify ways o f improving the current situation.

15.
Most participants from outside the Ministry o f Water Resources agreed that there i s a need to
improve demand management before embarking on new costly investments such as desalination plants
and new dams. Better water management implies reductions in wastage, increase in tariffs, rehabilitation
o f the existing infrastructure, and decentralization o f responsibilities. They also emphasized the need to
include economic analysis in the comparison o f alternative options such as construction o f new dams and
water treatment plants to allow people to have an informed opinion about the feasible options. Some
participants argued the importance o f finding the reasons for failure o f existing wastewater treatment
plants and focusing o n their rehabilitation and operation.
A M o r e Transparent and Responsive Government

20.

During the consultations, the government has been qualified as too “controlling”, “rigid”, and
“bureaucratic”. There was collective sentiment that a more responsive and enabling Government would
open the way for greater economic growth. Such perceptions came out most strongly in the discussions
with stakeholders from the private sector which stressed the need to reduce the role o f the State in areas
where the private sector should take the lead such as land tenure and financial markets, and to improve
the Government’s role as regulator. Although the Government’s rhetoric regarding the private sector has
changed, entrepreneurs and executives said that the Government’s attitude towards private f i r m s has not
changed. Firms are s t i l l faced with hostile bureaucrats, red tape, lengthy delays to obtain authorizations,
and inconsistent application o f the rules and regulations. The processes that were mentioned most often
as being hampered by bureaucracy include getting goods through customs, mostly in the Port o f Algiers;
obtaining a construction permit; and registering a firm. M a n y also mentioned corruption as a problem.

21.
In that perspective, the role o f the state they argued should be clearly outlined and limited to
establishing and enforcing the rules o f the game, promoting competition and facilitating wherever needed
private sector investment. In this framework, the role o f regulation i s to ensure the interface between
these two sectors and to facilitate the development o f competitive practices.

22.
The important role to be played by the State as a starter or catalyst o f the information society
transformation has been stressed during the I C T symposium. This role includes the modernization o f the
education system, the adoption o f ICT in the public administration to streamline i t s internal processes and
strengthen i t s capabilities, and the adoption o f incentive measures favoring private sector-led initiatives
and investments. Participants highlighted the role that I C T can play in strengthening governance and
consolidating the democratic process.
Greater Participation and Voice

23.
The lack of participation and dialogue between political and government leaders, on the one
hand, and civil society and private sector, on the other was mentioned as a major impediment for
reform and democracy in Algeria. Representatives f r o m local governments identified communication,
dialogue and participation as a key area for improvement-between central and local governments, and
with citizens at large. Academics and economic journalists emphasized that the identification and
implementation o f socio-economic reforms could not be construed without active participation o f the
private sector and c i v i l society in order to build a consensus.

Page 6 of 8

Annex 11

24.
Members o f the private sector underscored the growing communication gap between the
government and the private sector. The lack o f consultations surrounding the reform o f customs taxes in
2001 was given as an example. Private entrepreneurs confessed that in order to survive in a business
environment fraught with uncertainties and rigidities, they often had to take illegal actions, to the
detriment o f society.

25.
Participants in the rural development workshop emphasized the need to resort more frequently to
participatory approaches in order to integrate local populations, including women in particular, into the
development process in the context o f projects and programs. They also saluted the open and frank
dialogue on rural development that i s being carried out widely in Algeria and i s but one manifestation o f
the drastic change o n rural development perspectives in Algeria.
26.
M o s t participants in the consultations were hopeful that c i v i l society groups that wish to play a
role in shaping the reform agenda are growing in number and in influence. Participants saw these groups
as important vehicles to promote democracy in the economic arena and to ensure that suggested reforms
were discussed with and thoroughly explained to citizens.
Governance

27.
The consultations on social development and governance issues with Algerian researchers aiming
at understanding the key social and governance challenges in Algeria. The selection o f the participants
aimed to ensure an adequate balance between academics, professionals with direct experience in key
sectors, field research in rural and urban areas o f the country, gender, age and geographical
representation.
28.
During the workshop, a set o f benchmarks were recommended to measure progress in improving
the quality o f governance: (a) strengthening the institutions that coordinate and monitor public sector
reform; (b) support the development o f instruments for multi-year planning and control, including budget
management and performance monitoring; (c) strengthening the incentives and accountability o f public
sector employees; (d) introducing mechanisms for the public to provide feedback on the performance o f
the public sector; and (e) increasing the access o f public to public sector information. The main issues on
governance and public sector reform that emergedfrom the discussions are:
K e y actors with l o w access, voice and participation:
0
Low-income citizens, with l o w asset base (particularly the women heads o f households, the
elderly and the young with l o w education);
Municipalities with low-resource base;
0
0
Small and medium enterprises.
Barriers to Participation such as:
0
Lack o f resources (financial, assets), education, access to information, mechanisms to provide
feedback;
Weak organizational capabilities;
0
0
Lack o f legalhegulatory framework that ensures recognition o f property rights;
0
Lack o f predictable, timely and low-cost judicial decision-making;
0
Lack o f competition and easy entry o f alternative service providers (e.g. lack o f access to public
contracts);
0
Lack o f incentives to deploy staff to poor, remote areas;
0
Municipalities are inadequately staffed, with inadequate and predictable intergovernmental
transfers.

Annex 11

Page 7 of 8

Institutional Barriers to Performance including:
Lack o f incentives driving the performance o f public civil servants (lack o f merit-based civil
service recruitment and promotion and lack o f effective sanctions for poor performance or
corruption);
0
Inadequate demarcation o f responsibilities for delivery;
Lack o f transparent and performance-oriented budgeting process;
Lack o f accountability both upwards (fiscal accountability) and downwards (oversight, political
accountability).

T h e R o l e o f the World Bank Group

29.

Participants in many workshops alluded to difficulties working with the Bank Group in the past:
cumbersome processes, dogmatic views, unwillingness to listen, advocate o f structural adjustment
policies that have not had a positive impact on growth.

30.
However they congratulated the Bank and the Ministry o f Finance o f Algeria for engaging in a
consultative process and expressed interest in maintaining open channels o f communication. Nonetheless
they did express some skepticism about the Bank’s sincerity in engaging in this process and willingness
t o take their views into account. They are waiting to see what tangible outcomes will come out o f the
discussions as proof o f the Bank’s genuineness.

ANNEX111: PARTNERSHIPS
M a c r o economic
framework, private
and financial sectors

International Monetary Fund. In June 2000, in the context o f the Article IV
consultation discussions, a joint I M F N o r l d Bank team prepared an
assessment o f Algeria’s compliance with the Base1 Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision. The assessment prepared in the context o f the
Report on Standard and Codes (ROSCs) summarizes the extent to which
Algeria observes internationally recognized standards and codes in the area o f
banking supervision. ROSCs are used to help sharpen the institutions’ policy
discussions with national authorities, and in the private sector (including by
rating agencies) for risk assessment.
SMExchange Program. T o support the development o f the private sector,
particularly SMEs, the Bank helped establish the SMExchange Progra-a
regional initiative in N o r t h Africa that aims at linking the chambers o f
commerce from (mostly Southern) Europe to their counterparts in Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. The program, which was born out o f regional
economic and sector work, was launched in September 2002 during the
Marseille knowledge conference. The initiative will involve capacity building,
networking, and information exchange.
Program on Private Participation in Mediterranean Infrastructure. The
joint World BanWEuropean Commission Program o n Private Participation in
Mediterranean Infrastructure (PPMI), i s based in the Bank’s office in Brussels.
The purpose o f the PPMI program i s to foster private participation and
competition in infrastructure (telecommunications, energy, water and transport
sectors) in the countries o f the Middle East and North Africa, with emphasis
on Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, West Bank & Gaza, Lebanon
and Syria. PPMI pursues i t s goal through policy advice to governments, the
preparation o f development projects and technical assistance for support by the
W o r l d Bank and the EC, and the preparation and dissemination o f analytical
work.
The European Commission - MEDA Program. Algeria i s one o f the 12
Southern Mediterranean Counties participating in the Barcelona process and
as such benefits from European Commission MEDA funds. The EC program
focuses on four main areas: (i)
support to economic reforms and strengthening
o f market institutions (to help Algeria integrate in the world economy and
increase the country’s competitiveness); (ii)
infrastructure development (to
increase private sector participation and reinforce integration with
Mediterranean and EU countries); (iii)
human resources development, and; (iv)
rule o f l a w and good governance (to improve security and the prospects for
FDI in the country).

EUR 164 m i l l i o n o f Meda funds were committed in the 1996-1999 period.
Programs currently ongoing include a structural adjustment facility, projects
for the promotion o f SMEs, an industrial restructuring and privatization
initiative, a financial services sector project (EUR 23 million), and operations
in the area o f industrial waste clean-up (EUR 10.75 million). EUR 90 m i l l i o n
have been committed since 2000 for four new programs including for telecom
and postal services reform, support for journalists and the Algerian media, the
police force, and the reform o f professional training. The total commitment
