EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.

South Africa’s economic performance during the first decade o f freedom has been
impressive on several counts. Sound macroeconomic policies and strong fiscal discipline
contributed to the 3 percent average annual growth during the first decade after 1994. Since
2004, growth has accelerated to close to 5 percent. However, the social conditions for the
majority o f the South African population have not improved as hoped, poverty levels have
not been reduced significantly, and the burden o f disease (in particular HIV and AIDS) and
unemployment remained high, the latter at more than 24 percent in 2007.

ii.
South Africa contributes 38 percent o f Sub-Saharan Africa’s Gross Domestic Product
( G D P j i t s nine largest cities alone account for about 24 percent o f Africa’s GDP. Growth
spillovers to the rest o f the continent are exceptionally large by international standards: an
additional percentage point o f South African growth i s associated with 0.5 to 0.75 percent
GDP growth increases in the rest o f Africa, independent o f common regional shocks. Going
forward, South Africa wants to strengthen i t s role as a driver o f economic growth and a
promoter o f good governance in Africa.

...

This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), developed j o i n t l y w i t h the South African
National Treasury, supports South Africa’s national, regional, and international development
priorities. It aims to build a stronger and more dynamic partnership, with a main focus o n
knowledge sharing, and based o n an improvement in the dialogue between South Africa and
the Bank Group since the previous Country Assistance Strategy was prepared in 1999.
111.

iv.
The CPS focus i s o n the eradication o f poverty and the reduction o f inequality in
South Africa and the region. This focus i s in l i n e with the mandates o f both the Government
o f South Africa and the W o r l d Bank Group. The proposed strategy consists o f t w o pillars and
one cross-cutting theme. The two pillars are: (i)
urban and rural development; and (ii)
regional integration. The cross-cutting theme i s capacity-building for public service delivery.
v.
This CPS proposes that the Bank Group’s engagement shifts from a largely predetermined program o f activities to a more flexible approach in w h i c h broad priorities are
defined for the entire period while specific activities are agreed o n a yearly basis in a manner
consistent with South Africa’s planning and budgeting cycle.
vi.
The first pillar o f the CPS i s urban and rural development, and aims to support
several o f the k e y areas targeted by the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South
Africa (ASGISA). These include:
Urban and municipal development. The Bank Group will scale-up i t s support to assist
the Government in creating more inclusive cities.
Land reform and agriculture. The Departments o f Agriculture and L a n d Affairs will
engage the Bank o n a multi-year, comprehensive program for technical assistance and
analytical work.
Private sector development. The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will support better targeting and
assistance to small and medium-scale enterprises and foreign direct investment.

vii

Environment. The Bank plans t o continue support in the area o f the conservation and
sustainable use o f South Africa’s biodiversity and i t s ability to cope with climate
change.
Infrastructure. This i s a new area o f engagement, building o n recent analytical work.
Activities will include the energy sector and assistance with respect to the
preparations for W o r l d Cup 2010.

vii.
Under the second pillar-Regional Integration-the strategy proposes three clusters
o f activities in which South Africa and the W o r l d B a n k Group collaborate to support the rest
o f Africa:
0

Facilitating South Africa’s companies to invest in Africa. IFC and MIGA both have
large, successful, and growing portfolios that actively support South African
companies (private and public) “going north”, including investing in regional
infrastructure.
Building regional communities, starting with the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC). The Bank will w o r k with South Africa to assist S A D C in the
areas o f creation o f regional free trade areas and customs unions, facilitation o f
investment through harmonization o f the investment climate, strengthening o f
regional financial markets, and improving sectoral collaboration, e.g., in health
services in Southern Africa.
Sharing knowledge in support ofAfrica. The W o r l d Bank Institute (WBI) will scale
up i t s assistance to South Africa and use South Africa as a hub for Southern Africa
and the rest o f the region, as part o f the Bank’s Africa Action Plan.

...

viii.
The cross-cutting theme relates to Capacity Buildingfor Public Service Delivery.
Considerable capacity-development support will come as technical assistance provided in
various sectors, including under the t w o pillars discussed above. In addition, the W o r l d Bank
Institute has made South Africa a focus country.
ix.
B a n k instruments to be used are primarily economic and sector w o r k (formal reports
and informal policy notes), technical assistance and capacity building. The financing sources
are the Bank budget and grant facilities, which are limited, and the Government’s o w n
budget. The Government has indicated i t s willingness to increasingly deploy i t s o w n budget
to finance Bank knowledge services. In addition, the Government and the Bank will
investigate the possibility o f working together to mobilize trust funds to ramp up knowledge
and capacity building support for South Africa, including for regional partnerships. These
w o u l d b e opened to other development partners following the principles o f the Paris
Declaration. In effect, this CPS calls for initiating a higher level o f collaboration between the
development partners than exists currently.
x.

Executive Directors m a y wish to consider the following issues for discussion:
Does the CPS adequately address the k e y challenges o f reducing poverty and
inequality, given the Bank’s comparative advantage?
A r e the results targeted by this CPS appropriate for a flexible Middle Income Country
(MIC) framework?

...

Vlll

Will the instruments and financing resources identified enable the Bank to scale-up
i t s support for knowledge and capacity-building to a level commensurate with South
Africa’s importance for Sub-Saharan Africa?

INTRODUCTION
1.
South Africa has achieved a high level o f political and economic stability over the
last ten years. A decade o f prudent economic policies and improving macroeconomic
fundamentals have resulted in l o w inflation and increased investor confidence. The
Government i s determined to accelerate economic growth and ensure that a greater part o f the
benefits f l o w to the poor to ensure the sustainability o f the development path. The m a i n
challenge i s n o w to reduce poverty and inequality through faster growth, more rapid labor
absorption and effective delivery o f Government services to more empowered communities.
For these reasons, the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) supports the Government’s
development agenda by focusing o n two m a i n pillars: (i)
urban and rural development; and
(ii)
regional integration.
2.
The f i r s t W o r l d Bank Group strategy for South Africa was presented to the Board in
M a y 1999. Nearly five years into the post-apartheid transition, that strategy was primarily
aimed at helping to reduce the historical legacy o f poverty and inequality by “building a
knowledge partnership” centered around three key development objectives: promoting higher
growth and employment, fostering social and environmental sustainability; and strengthening
South Africa’s constructive role in regional development. These strategic themes are s t i l l
relevant and are broadly maintained in this CPS. However, in retrospect, the 1999 strategy
was too vague, lacked selectivity, and was only partially reflected in the subsequent program
implementation. Policy dialogue between the Bank Group and the Government was lacking
in substance during most o f the intervening period. Finally, in practice, the “push for
lending” overshadowed the stated goal o f knowledge sharing and generation, resulting, inter
alia, in a failure to develop the appropriate analytical products and instruments.

3.
This CPS aims to improve alignment o f the W o r l d Bank Group’s program with the
Government’s development agenda. This agenda includes, but i s not restricted to, the
Government’s “Program o f Action”, i t s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, the recently
launched Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa and South Africa’s
various partnership initiatives with the rest o f Africa. Developed j o i n t l y with the National
Treasury -the
Bank’s principal counterpart-and
through consultations with sector
departments, c i v i l society, the private sector, and the development partners, the CPS lays out
the m a i n B a n k activities for the next five years, while also providing the necessary flexibility
to rapidly respond to new demands. The CPS incorporates an enhanced “rapid response”
capacity by the W o r l d Bank Group as an essential element o f the partnership strategy. This
CPS also proposes that the Bank Group’s engagement shifts f r o m a largely pre-determined
program o f activities to a more flexible approach in w h i c h broad priorities are defined for the
entire period while specific activities are agreed o n a yearly basis in a manner consistent with
South Africa’s planning and budget cycle.

POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND REGIONAL CONTEXT
FROM
APARTHEIDTO DEMOCRACY
4.
South Africa’s 1994 transition f r o m apartheid to constitutional democracy has been
one o f the most astonishing political achievements o f our time. I t i s a powerful demonstration
that a peaceful, negotiated path f r o m conflict and injustice to cooperation and reconciliation
i s possible. Since 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) has w o n landslide victories in
each democratic election held. Elections are w e l l managed and fair, and the press
unrestrained. Small opposition partiers are vociferous and enjoy full political freedom.

5.
In a very short time, a n e w nation has been built. In a l l spheres and sectors o f
Government, o l d legal and policy frameworks have been replaced with n e w ones to reflect
the n e w dispensation. The design o f these legal and policy reforms i s consistently rated by
observers as international best practice.
6.
In the 1999 elections Thabo Mbeki, who had succeeded Nelson Mandela as head o f
the ANC, became South Africa’s n e w president. Parliamentary elections in April 2004 again
resulted in a resounding victory for the ANC, which w o n nearly 70 percent o f the vote. The
new parliament subsequently reelected President Mbeki. The second round o f post-apartheid
local Government elections in March 2006 confirmed the continued popularity o f the ANC,
which took two-thirds o f the vote. However, during the election campaign, it became obvious
that the electorate, while loyal to the ANC and appreciative o f the many gains achieved under
i t s leadership, i s becoming increasingly h s t r a t e d about poor service delivery in townships,
informal settlements and rural communal areas.

LEGACIES
AND CHALLENGES
7.
Apartheid gave rise to one o f the most unequal and racially segregated societies in the
world. This inequality i s so pervasive and persistent because apartheid was not just a political
process o f disenfranchising the black majority. Apartheid’s social engineering systematically
closed o f f o r distorted a l l avenues for the majority o f the population to accumulate capital in
the form o f ownership o f land and businesses, but also in the f o r m o f skilled, educated and
healthy labor.
8.
The legacy o f apartheid i s a l l too apparent in the everyday lives o f the majority o f the
population. South Africa i s a society where deeply-entrenched poverty, illiteracy,
unemployment and loss o f human dignity among the majority o f the black population coexist with economic wealth, scholastic achievements, and a “first world” lifestyle among the
white population at par with the richest countries in Europe.
9.
About 95 percent o f the poor are black. Women are particularly affected: femaleheaded households have a 50 percent higher poverty rate than male-headed households, with
rural women suffering more than urban. Unemployment stands at more than 24 percent.’

’

The definition of “unemployed” used here does not include discouraged job seekers, but i s the narrow definition: a
person within the economically active population who (a) did not work in the seven days prior to the reference point,
(b) wants to work and i s available to start work within two weeks o f the reference point, and (c) has taken active steps
to look for work or start some form of self-employment in the four days prior to the reference point.

2

10.
Income and asset inequality i s severe: 53 percent o f the population o f 47 million
accounts for less than 10 percent o f total consumption, and the poorest 20 percent account for
only 2.8 percent. Land distribution i s one o f the most unequal in the world, with 55,000 white
farmers owning 85 percent o f the agricultural land.

11.
For the majority o f South Africans living conditions are much closer to those in other
African countries. Notwithstanding the serious debate about the validity o f poverty data in
South Africa, there i s consensus that progress in improving poverty and income distribution
indicators over the past decade has been mixed. Between 1995 and 2000, the percentage of
the population living below the poverty l i n e increased from 28 to 33 percent2 During the
same period, inequality also i n c r e a ~ e d However,
.~
between 2000 and 2004, poverty appears
to have gone down, although researchers disagree on the extent o f the reduction, and the
contribution o f the rapid increase in expenditures on social grants to this reductions4
12.
Despite the enormity o f the backlogs, Government initiatives to meet these challenges
have had encouraging results. The pro-poor reorientation o f spending has contributed to
improved social development indicators in a range o f areas, particularly relating to access to
services and education. Progress has also been made toward meeting some o f the other
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs on primary education, gender, several
health indicators, and environmental sustainability are likely to be achieved (Annex A).

13.
Since 1994, social grants expenditure and the number o f beneficiaries have more than
tripled. In 2006/7, Government allocated close to ZAR70 billion to social grants, reaching
about 11 million South Africans. The main grants are for child upp port,^ foster care, care
dependency, disability, and old age. Other forms o f welfare support include conditional
grants for school feeding and early childhood development, and free health care and nutrition
programs for the poor.
14.
Still, as much as one-quarter o f the population continues to live in substandard,
informal dwellings, due to large and growing backlogs fueled by the high migration rate to
urban areas. The current paradox i s that South Africa’s nine major cities are simultaneously
the main source o f about 60 percent o f South Africa’s GDP, but, fueled by a massive

The poverty datum line i s set at ZAR322 per month. Among researchers, serious debate about the quality o f poverty
data in South Africa continues. See Policy Co-ordination and Advisory Services, Social Sector, T h e Presidency, South
Africa. 2006. “A Nation in the Making: A Discussion Document on Macro-social Trends in South Africa.”
See Bhorat, H. and Kanbur, R. (eds.), “Poverty and Well-being in Post Apartheid South Africa: An Overview o f
Data, Outcomes and Policy”, September, 2005, p.5.

See van der Berg, S., Burger, R., Louw, M. and Yu, D., (2005), “Trends in poverty and inequality since the political
transition”, Stellenbosch Economic Working Papers No. 112005. Authors estimate a reduction in the number of people
living in poverty by more than 3 million (from 18.5 million to 15.4 million).
Also see Meth, C., (2006) “Income Poverty in 2004: A second engagement with the recent van der Berg et al. figures”,
Working Paper 47, September. T h e author argues that a fall by 1.5 million i s more likely.
A key initiative was the introduction o f means-tested child support grants in 1998, and more recently, the extension
of eligibility for the grants to older children. As o f 2006, 3.4 million children were receiving the grants, compared with
400,000 who received the previous state maintenance grant.

migration, are also the source o f unemployment, poverty, crime6 and HIV and AIDS
infections.
15.
M u c h has also been achieved since 1994 in terms o f infrastructure supply. Capital
spending has focused on improving the provision o f basic utility services to schools and
clinics, while 56,000 new classrooms and 1,700 new clinics were built. In addition, since the
end o f apartheid, 1.6 million free housing units have been constructed for low-income
families, 4 million houses were electrified, and potable water supply and basic sanitation
services were provided to 9 million and 6.4 million people, respectively. Much was spent
also on the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance o f 6,000 km o f national roads and
15,000 km o f provincial roads, with about ZARlO billion private sector investment in toll
road public private partnerships.
16.
Undoing the so-called “geography o f apartheid”, which forced black families to split
up between urban townships far from city centers and the place o f work, on the one hand, and
barren rural “homelands” with no agricultural potential, on the other, i s the key challenge to
creating more inclusive, functional, efficient and socially sustainable cities and rural areas.
However, in the last decade insufficient progress has been made on this front, while new
demand i s putting even more pressure on these backlogs.
17.
The massive increases in social and capital expenditures have clearly benefited large
numbers o f previously disadvantaged people. However, the economic and social impact of
these expenditures has not been commensurate. For instance, South Africa’s educational
outcomes in terms o f reading and math scores are modest compared to, say, Kenya and
Tanzania. Similarly, the ZAR34 billion (or about US$5 billion) o f investment in free housing
for the poor has lost a third o f i t s value, because the housing was built in remote and
economically unattractive areas.

18.
HIV and AIDS pose a great threat to human capital development in South Africa over
the long-term and w i l l impact upon both economic growth and service delivery. Estimates of

Comparing the investment climates of Brazil, India and South Africa, the World Bank found that, although the
investment climate in South Africa (29th) was better than Brazil (121st) and India (1 34th), it lagged behind other MICs
such as Thailand, Malaysia and Chile. Key binding constraints for enterprises in South Africa were the lack of skilled
labor and exchange rate volatility, but crime was not far behind (see “The Investment Climate in Brazil, India, and
South Africa: A Contribution to the India, Brazil, and South Africa Debate”, available at
http:~/sitcreso~~rccs.worldbank.ol./(NTDRAZIl,/Resources!BrazilIndiaSouthAfricalnvcstnientClimate~o~n~arison.pdf).
According to the Bank’s 2004 Investment Climate Assessment, the economic cost o f crime i s probably greatest for
informal and small size enterprises who are also facing other basic access problems, especially on finance, land, and,
generally, collateral. Such f i r m s seem to suffer much more from crime than their counterparts elsewhere in Africa.
According to a CID paper by Christopher Stone (see “Crime, Justice, and Growth in South Africa: Toward a Plausible
Contribution from Criminal Justice to Economic Growth.”, CID Working Paper No. 13 1: 2006), victimization rates
(the “volume” o f crime) are comparable to England, but violent crimes (murder) are as high as in places such as
Washington D.C. South Africa’s robbery rates are twice as high as in the US. states with the highest rates of robbery,
and rape i s two to three times worse. South Africans’ fear o f housebreakingi s very high, higher than robbery or assault.
Cost o f crime to f i r m s i s comparable to Brazil, Russia, Peru and the Philippines, but South African f i r m s pay less for
security and get less security than f i r m s in other middle income countries.
Since 2001, overall crime statistics have improved in several areas (see www.saix.qov.za/i/).However, the insurance
industry has reported an increase in organized, violent crime. Going forward, the Government intends to forge a much
closer partnership to combat crime with the private sector, civil society and communities, and to ensure a much closer
collaboration between the various Government organizations involved.

the reduction in annual growth attributable to HIV and A I D S range f r o m 0.5 to 2.5 percent7,
as a result o f lower labor supply, lower productivity and higher production costs. An
estimated 5.5 m i l l i o n people are currently living with HIV and A I D S according to U N A I D S .
One in five South Africans between the ages o f 15 and 49 i s HIV positive. L i f e expectancy
for a child born in 2005 i s less than 50 years, down f r o m 62 years in 1992. Adult mortality i s
three times as high in South Africa as in middle income countries with similar income per
capita, while between 1997 and 2004, the death rates for women and m e n tripled and
doubled, respectively.* The poor are particularly vulnerable, while HIV and AIDS, and TB
have severely strained the health system and contributed to a decline in a range o f health
indicators, notably infant and maternal mortality and l i f e expectancy. The disease will also
affect the cost, allocation and efficiency o f Government services.
19.
The Government response has at times been criticized as inconsistent. However, in
2004, the Health Department launched the “Comprehensive Plan for Management, Care and
Treatment o f HIV and AIDS” with by far the largest budget allocation o f any l o w - o r middleincome c ~ u n t r y .Government
~
reported that approximately 3 80,000 people were under
treatment as o f June 2007. U S A I D ” alone spent US$220 m i l l i o n o n a range o f HIV and
A I D S programs in South Africa in 2006, and will increase i t s support going forward. The
Government declared 2006 “the year o f accelerated HIV and A I D S prevention”, with the
Deputy President n o w leading a renewed effort to combat the pandemic. This has resulted in
a new 5 year plan to which Government and i t s social partners have committed: the National
Strategic Plan 2007- 11.

ECONOMIC
CONTEXT-FROMSTABILIZATION TO ACCELERATED
AND SHARED GROWTH
20.
In 1994, and for many years prior to that date, South Africa’s economy was unstable,
with high inflation, high real interest rates, large fiscal deficits, ballooning public debt,
rapidly falling public and private investment, and anemic economic growth. Apartheid had
created an economy which was highly isolated, protected, regulated and distorted through a
complex web o f laws, policies, and regulations. At the time, few observers w o u l d have
predicted that more than a decade later, the country’s economy w o u l d be in the excellent
shape it i s in today. Economic growth, while not spectacular, i s nonetheless robust. South
Africa’s revenue collection and fiscal and debt management are considered international best

competitive borrower. Currently, South Africa i s borrowing (both domestic and foreign) at
unprecedented l o w sovereign risk spreads: a demonstration o f investor confidence which i s
rare for emerging markets. The continued declining borrowing requirement, together with a
sophisticated domestic market, makes South Africa one o f only a few countries that can
finance i t s entire borrowing requirement domestically, In fact, borrowing by the South
African Government in the foreign market i s mainly done to create benchmarks for South
African corporations wanting to borrow abroad. And as a result o f the demand for South
African paper, a number o f multilateral development finance institutions and corporations are
borrowing through Rand Eurobonds. The increased demand for these bonds i s another signal
o f confidence in the South African economy and allows South Africa to raise capital globally
in Rands (see Box 1).
Box 1: The World Bank’s South African Rand Bonds
As part o f its funding strategy and overall development objectives, the World Bank regularly issues bonds in
“nontraditional Currencies”, e.g. emerging market and European accession countries’ currencies. The Bank does
this because these bonds are issued on financial terms that are cost effective to the World Bank, but above all to
deepen and broaden domestic capital markets. They are attractive to investors, because they provide a AAA
investment in an emerging market currency, which normally yields higher returns than in traditional markets.
South African Rand Eurobonds have been popular instruments for offshore investors as well as for high-grade
issuers, most o f which swap their Rand liabilities into one o f the major currencies. The Rand Eurobond market has
been thriving for over a decade and i s the most developed emerging capital market, as measured by volume o f
issuance, range o f maturities and availability and liquidity of derivative instruments.
The World Bank’s first South African Rand denominated bond was launched in July 1996, initially to respond to
demands from retail investors in Europe. Since then, the World Bank has issued a total o f ZAR95 billion worth o f
bonds, of which ZAR83 billions were outstanding at the end o f 2006. They are issued at a fixed interest rate, with
the size of each bond-packageissue ranging from ZAR16 million to ZAR3 billion, and maturities varying from 1 to
30 years.
South African Rand bonds are popular: they represented 36 percent of all World Bank bonds in non-traditional
currencies during 2002-2006. The majority of these bonds i s sold to retail investors in Japan (95 percent).

22.
Exemplary fiscal management has been the k e y to the stabilization effort. Fiscal
deficits were brought down, and turned into a small budget surplus in 2007/8. This
remarkable achievement was due to dramatic improvements in revenue collection rather than
expenditure cuts and tax rate increases. Moreover, some tax rates were cut, as major
improvements in the efficiency o f tax collection were implemented by an independent
revenue authority-the
South African Revenue Service (SARS). l2 In addition, other
institutions o f public financial management were substantially reformed to improve
transparency, monitoring and accountability in public finances in all spheres o f
13
government.

’’

S A R S has been one o f the great success stories o f fiscal management in the new South Africa. In 200516, for
instance, tax revenues stood at ZAR411 billion, ZAR41 billion more than anticipated and 18 percent higher than the
year before. In 200617, tax revenues increased further by more than 15 percent, reaching ZAR480 billion.
l3The new Constitution established three distinct and interdependent spheres o f Government, each o f which i s entitled
to an ‘equitable share’ o f the national revenue pool. T h e first three-year Medium Term Expenditure Framework was
implemented in the 199811999 Fiscal Year; the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) came into effect in 2000; and
the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) was implemented in 2004. Detailed spending and service delivery
plans are now published for all national departments and a wide range o f public entities. Since 2003, these plans and
budgets have featured measurable outputs and outcomes to enable a transparent assessment o f performance.

6

23.
Stabilization was h r t h e r strengthened by the adoption in 2000 o f an annual inflation
target range o f 3 to 6 percent, which has been achieved since 2004 (see Figure I).
The
Reserve B a n k i s independent and the financial sector i s deep and w e l l regulated. T h e
exchange rate i s freely floating. While i t has experienced significant volatility, this has not
been excessive compared to other emerging markets. However, the current account deficit
has steadily risen f r o m very l o w levels in the early 2000s to about 6.5 percent o f GDP in
2007. This has put some downward pressure o n the Rand during 2006 and 2007.

Figure 1: South Africa’s real GDP growth, inflation and unemployment

24.
Greater integration with the rest o f the w o r l d resulted in a sharp turnaround in
productivity performance. l4Exchange controls have been gradually liberalized, and the
average (un-weighted) tariff on imports into South Africa was reduced from 22 percent to
around 11 percent, while virtually all quantitative restrictions were removed. This resulted in
more diversified exports, reducing, in particular, the dominance o f mining. However, overall
export performance i s disappointing: exports as a share o f GDP are at around 30 percent,
which i s relatively low, while exports per capita are barely higher than in 1960.l5

25.

W h i l e South Africa’s success in stabilizing the economy i s impressive, the l o w
growth in jobs and investment leaves significant r o o m for improvement. While investment
has risen in recent years, due to reduced Government budget deficits and lower borrowing
costs, domestic investment i s constrained by relatively l o w levels o f saving, and foreign
investment i s relatively insignificant, particularly in “green field investments.” I t would

appear that investors have been deterred by a range o f factors, including the high cost o f
skilled labor, exchange rate volatility, labor relations and crime. l6
26.
High unemployment i s the most important constraint to both poverty reduction and
accelerating growth in South Africa. After the fall o f Apartheid, a “perfect storm” gathered to
aggravate the unemployment levels f r o m around 15 percent to the current 24 percent, while
real wages were essentially ~ t a g n a n t . ’The
~ storm consisted o f a lack o f increase in overall
labor demand, the large influx o f African women into the labor market (as part o f a total
increase in the participation rate o f 6 percent), a shedding o f unskilled labor in the mining
and agricultural sectors, as w e l l as manufacturing, and skills-biased technical change in the
economy (a global trend).
t

27.
High unemployment i s a structural phenomenon, rather than simply caused by a lack
o f labor market flexibility. The National Treasury recently pointed out that “(T)he causes o f
unemployment are embedded in both the physical and sectoral structure o f the economy,
shaped for so long by barriers to urbanization and modernization, and the distribution o f
skills and human capability, also held back for decades by apartheid policy and structures.’y18
Recent research also points out that unless more productive employment i s created, in
particular in labor-intensive manufacturing and exports, an acceleration o f economic growth
and poverty reduction i s unlikely to be a ~ h i e v e d . ’ ~
28.
Going forward, the Government’s main objectives are to accelerate growth and
reduce unemployment and poverty within a stable macroeconomic environment. The
Government’s Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa seeks to relax key
binding constraints o n growth, and aims to achieve average growth rates o f at least 4.5
percent in 2005-09 and 6 percent in 2010-14, and halve the unemployment and poverty rates
by 2014 f r o m 2004 levels. Government authorities are also in favor o f restructuring large
state owned enterprises, together with the sale o f their non-core assets, to increase their
efficiency as opposed to privatization.

29.
The Government plans to boost investment in infrastructure and selected social
programs, but favors the maintenance o f a neutral fiscal stance in the next few years. This i s
viewed as appropriate given the current account deficit, which would also imply a moderately
lower rate o f expenditure growth than currently planned. The current account deficit and high
reliance o n portfolio inflows have raised vulnerability to external shocks. However, the
country’s strong fundamentals, including l o w external debt, a solid and improving reserves
position, a sound financial sector, and adherence to a flexible exchange rate, should help limit
the adverse impact o f these shocks o n the economy.

REGIONAL CONTEXT-ENGINE OF GROWTH
AND REGIONAL POWER BROKER

30.
South Africa drives African growth, with South Africa’s growth rate showing an
unusually strong correlation with growth in the rest o f the continent. South Africa constitutes
38 percent o f Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP 20-its nine largest cities alone account for close to
24 percent o f Africa’s GDP.21Growth spillovers to the rest o f the continent are exceptionally
large by international standards: an additional percentage point o f South African growth i s
associated with 0.5 to 0.75 percent GDP growth increases in the rest o f Africa (not just
neighboring countries), independent o f common regional shocks.22 This i s larger than global
average spillover effects.

3 1.
These spillovers result f r o m many sources. In 2006, exports to Africa (15 percent o f
total exports o f South Africa) stood at about US$4.5 b i l l i o n and imports from Africa at
US$2.5 billion, but are growing rapidly, up f r o m U S $ l .1 b i l l i o n in 2003. South Africa i s also
a source o f expertise and investment into the continent, contributing about US$1 b i l l i o n
annually.23 In banking, construction, tourism, retailing and many other sectors, South African
companies are instilling n e w service standards and opening up new opportunities across the
continent.
32.
South Africa i s one o f the driving forces behind the N e w Partnership for African
Development (NEPAD) and the African Peer Review Mechanism, and an anchor o f other key
regional partnerships (African Union, SADC, and Southern Africa Customs U n i o n - SACU).
Internationally, the country i s a leading developing country participant in most multilateral
fora, including being the chair o f the G-20 in 2007.

33.
A vigorous and prosperous South Africa i s an essential building block behind efforts
to promote growth and reduce poverty o n the African continent. The direct impact o f South
Africa o n the sub-region i s straightforward: a stable, growing and outward-focused South
Africa can b e an engine o f growth for i t s neighbors, while a stagnant and inwardly-absorbed
South Africa could curtail the ongoing regional recovery at an early stage. But these direct
linkages are not only one way: South Africa’s neighbors have m u c h to offer as well,
including valuable development lessons, rapidly growing markets (the biggest source o f
South African export growth in the last few years has been expansion into neighboring
markets), investment opportunities, an expanded supply o f skilled labor, transport links (such
as port access through the Maputo corridor), and natural resources to relieve critical shortages

20

In 2003, South Africa’s GDP was 38 percent o f SSA’s GDP on a nominal basis, and about one-third on a Purchasing
Power Parity basis. South Africa accounted for 30 percent o f expansion in African G D P (on Purchasing Power Parity
basis) between 1980 and 2003. South Africa’s and SSA growth are strongly correlated, with a coefficient o f over 0.8.
The back o f the envelope calculation runs as follows: South Africa i s 38 percent o f Sub Saharan Africa’s GDP; the 9
largest South African cities are 60 percent o f South Africa’s GDP; and, therefore, about 24 percent o f Sub Saharan
Africa’s GDP.

Rest o f Africa.” IMF Working Paper No. 05/58.

For instance, according to the W o r l d Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure database, over 1998-2004, South
African f i r m s were involved in 31 projects across 17 different SSA countries w i t h an associated investment
commitment o f just over US$5 billion. W h i l e South African f i r m s did not hold 100 percent o f the equity in most o f
these projects, they held over h a l f in the majority o f cases. T h i s means that South African f i r m s account for around 20
percent o f total public-private investment commitments in SSA o f over U S 2 5 billion.

GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND
CHALLENGES
34.
As discussed above, South Africa’s economic performance during the first decade o f
freedom has been impressive o n several counts; it has emerged as a major player in Africa,
and an important developing country leader o n the w o r l d stage. However, huge development
challenges remain. T o continue as an engine o f growth and development in Africa, it i s
paramount for South Africa to meet these challenges.
35.
South Africa’s development strategy consequently faces the twin challenges o f
accelerating growth and sharing i t s benefits by broadening participation, extending
opportunities to all and improving the impact o f public service delivery. The next section
provides selected highlights o f the evolution o f the Government’s development agenda are
provided.

EVOLUTION
OF GOVERNMENT’S
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
36.
The ANC Government’s social development policy was drafted through extensive
consultations in the early 1990s and was eventually released as the Reconstruction and
Development Program (RDP) soon after the 1994 elections. The R D P set explicit targets for
the extension o f education, electricity, water, health care and housing to a l l South Africans
and sought to create new jobs through public works. I t also envisaged the implementation o f
a substantive land reform initiative and a new social security system.
37.
The macroeconomic component o f the RDP was further elaborated in 1996 upon the
adoption o f the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy (GEAR). GEAR aimed to
achieve annual GDP growth o f 6 percent and an increase in employment o f 400,000 jobs per
year by 2000. These were to be met by increasing fixed investment f r o m both domestic and
foreign sources and significantly improved exports, especially from the manufacturing,
tourism and other non-primary sectors. The wide-ranging policies introduced or re-affirmed
by GEAR focused o n sustaining macroeconomic stability; enhancing international
competitiveness; and reconfiguring the private and public sectors.

3 8.
Government’s expenditure priorities are expressed in a sophisticated Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The overall pattern o f Government expenditure has
improved markedly since the inception o f the MTEF in 1998/99. There has been a major shift
in responsibilities and budget f r o m national Government to provincial and local Government.
Most social and investment expenditure n o w takes place through the sub-national spheres o f
Government and their share o f the total revenue p o o l has r i s e n to around 60 percent. As
discussed in paragraphs 20-22, expenditure reforms have been matched by the strengthening
o f revenue administration and changes to the domestic tax system. Total debt has declined to
about 30 percent o f G D P and Government has introduced a range o f new instruments to
enhance liquidity.

10

39.
In 2003, the Government produced a major retrospective report - “Towards a Ten
Year Review.” The report assessed progress made in the first decade o f democracy and
challenges for the next decade. The overall conclusion was guardedly optimistic. I t noted that
m u c h had been achieved, and that the balance o f the f i r s t decade was decidedly positive.
However, i t warned that if the country stayed o n the current development path, replicating the
existing patterns o f inclusion and exclusion, the negatives w o u l d soon start to outweigh the
positives resulting in a “vicious cycle o f decline in all spheres.”
40.
In 2006, a major report o n social trends was issued by the Presidency - “A Nation in
the Making: A Discussion Document o n Macro-Social Trends in South Africa”24 - that tries
to provide a better understanding o f “the movement o f South African society f r o m i t s
apartheid past towards non-racialism, equity and unity in diversity.” The report notes the
improvements in the quality o f l i f e o f the majority o f the population, but also the backlogs.
These backlogs continue to be defined in terms o f race. In addition, the massive migration,
persistent poverty traps, the weakening o f the nuclear family, the H I V / A I D S epidemic, crime,
and the tension between a market-based competitive economy and a caring, equitable society
are highlighted as major challenges.

41.
Partly as a response t o the ten year review, Government launched the Accelerated and
Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA) in 2006. A S G I S A i s not presented as a
n e w economic policy, but as a focused set o f policies and interventions to catalyze higher and
shared growth, complementing or strengthening existing programs. One o f ASGISA’s m a i n
goals i s to bridge the divide between the so-called “first” and “second” economies-a
metaphor for the existing dualism. I t s analytical framework derives f r o m the “binding
constraints” analysis, which was recently developed by a number o f prominent international
economist^.^^ The Bank’s role in supporting the growth agenda i s described in B o x 2.

I

Box 2: The Bank’s support to economic analysis
In 2005, a Bank-supported “Growth and Jobs” workshop helped influence some o f the thinking behind the
ASGISA initiative. Earlier, the Bank and National Treasury jointly coordinated a high-level workshop to assess
poverty data and trends in South Africa. In 2000, the Bank fulfilled a role o f clearinghouse for international
expertise and knowledge exchange for a high-level retreat on South Africa’s development challenges between
South Africa’s President Thabo Mbeki, and the then World Bank President James Wolfensohn. And in 1996, the
team that developed the GEAR strategy included several Bank staff as its members.

However, whereas South Africa i s keen to obtain international advice, including from the World Bank, the overall
strategic economic policy framework i s clearly the product of a South African, home-grow vision o f how to
achieve accelerated and shared growth.
More in the background, the Bank has produced a steady flow o f informal and formal research outputs on key
economic issues, and has helped provide content to workshops on a wide range of topics-from service delivery
and poverty analysis to land reform and infrastructure. Most recently, a number o f papers were published jointly
with South African researchers on growth, industrial concentration and competitiveness.
Finally, dating back to the early 199Os, the Bank has assisted macroeconomic modeling through capacity building
activities with South African academics and Government officials. Currently, in collaboration with the National
Treasury, a strong technical assistance program i s in place that uses computable general equilibrium techniques to
simulate various policy choices, including those related to tax policy, expenditure policy, and the impact o f large
investment projects. T h i s partnership will possibly be scaled up and used as a platform to support regional
economic modeling capacity, with variable costs being financed by Government and other development partners.

The m a i n elements o f A S G I S A include (i)
an acceleration o f public investment in
infrastructure (ZAR416 b i l l i o n over three years); (ii)
a set o f targeted sector investments (in
business process outsourcing, tourism, chemicals, bio-fuels, metals and metallurgy, wood,

selected
economic reforms to reduce the cost o f telecommunications, and steel and chemicals;

The current development objectives are to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality by:
Accelerating the pace o f growth, and the rate o f investment in productive capacity;
Intervening decisively to advance the involvement o f the marginalized in economic
activity through expanded j o b creation and the promotion o f sustainable livelihoods;
Maintaining a progressive social security net alongside investment in community
services and human development;
Improving the capacity and effectiveness o f the state; and
Building regional and international partnerships for growth and development.

PAST PROGRAM AND LESSONS LEARNED
44.
What role should the Bank Group play to assist the Government in successfully
achieving the above mentioned objectives? Before answering this question, a critical
stocktaking o f the k e y lessons learned from the Bank’s past involvement with South Africa i s
appropriate. The following sections provide an overview o f the financial assistance provided
by the W o r l d B a n k Group to South Africa, followed by an overview o f the knowledge
partnership. A more detailed evaluation o f the W o r l d Bank assistance strategy to South
Africa i s provided in the Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR)
(Attachment 2).

THEWORLD BANKGROUP’S
PORTFOLIO
45.
Between 1951 and 1966, the Bank made 11 loans to South Africa, totaling US$242
million, largely for expanding the country’s r a i l and harbor systems and for generating and
transmitting electricity. The Bank ceased lending operations to South Africa in 1966 and the
loans from that earlier period were fully repaid by 1985.26F r o m the sixties until the dramatic
political changes that ended the apartheid era, there were n o Bank lending o r other activities.
46.
In 1991, the Bank resumed activities in South Africa through a comprehensive
program o f economic policy advice and capacity building. There was intense dialogue and

25 Harvard University’s Centre for International Development released several reports for the South African Growth
Initiative o f the National Treasury (NT) as part o f ASGISA.

The 11 loans were repaid on the following dates: 7 loans were repaid on June 30, 1979; 1 loan was repaid on May

interaction between the Bank and key sectors o f the South African society, in particular the
ANC, other (then) opposition parties, academics, and civil society.
47.
After 1994, in addition to providing policy advice, the Bank also provided limited
lending and grants. In 1997, it put in place the Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation
Project, now closed and fully disbursed. A technical assistance loan for the Municipal
Financial Management Technical Assistance Project was approved in 2002 for an amount o f
US$15 million. A request for Bank assistance on hospital revitalization resulted in the
appraisal o f a project in 200 1, but was then put on hold.
48.
South Africa and Lesotho have jointly implemented the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project, with the South African side repaying the two World Bank loans associated with this
project for a total disbursed amount o f about US$90 million.27
49.
Several capacity-building activities were funded through grants from the Institutional
Development Fund and the Information for Development Program (infoDev).28 In addition,
the World Bank managed a number o f technical assistance grants from the Cities Alliance for
South Africa’s cities.

50.
Finally, a number o f national and regional Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
grants were approved for nature conservation, renewable energy, and the phase-out o f toxic
chemicals for a total o f just under US$80 million. These included the Cape Peninsula
Biodiversity Conservation and the C.A.P.E. Biodiversity Conservation Projects (for a total o f
US$2 1.6 million), the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development
Project (US$8.2 million), the Greater Addo Elephant National Park Project (US$5.5 million),
and the Africa Stockpiles Project (US$1.7 million). South Africa and the Bank have jointly
carried-out these GEF projects throughout the country, supporting, among other areas,
community involvement in protected areas and policy making. For instance, the C.A.P.E.
Program i s leading the way in demonstrating the viability o f a business model for
biodiversity conservation outside o f protected areas, and the Cape Peninsula project received
a “highly satisfactory” rating by the Bank’s Internal Evaluation Group.
51.
IFC has an active program o f financial products and advisory services in South
Africa. The I F C strategy for South Africa has supported the Government’s objectives in terms
o f black economic empowerment, the development o f the small-medium enterprise (SME)
sector, developing financial markets, and supporting South African companies expanding
into Africa. I t has invested over US$600 million in South Africa since 1995. I t s current
investment portfolio amounts to US$341 million. IFC committed US$229 million in new
investments in South Africa in fiscal year 2007 (not including investments with South
African companies outside South Africa). This i s IFC’s second largest portfolio in Sub27 The project transfers water from the highlands o f Lesotho to the Gauteng region of South Africa. The Phase 1A
loan, originally for an amount of US110 million, was approved on July 23, 1991 and was closed on March 3 1, 1999
one year after the scheduled closing date, after a total of US$41.1 million was cancelled. South Africa fully paid out the
balance o f the loan. The Phase 1B loan, originally for an amount o f U S 4 5 million, was approved on June 4, 1998.
T h i s loan i s guaranteed jointly by Lesotho and South Africa. The Loan disbursed US$21.66 million and was closed on
December 3 1,2006 two years after the originally scheduled closing date.

holding o f US$3.6 m i l l i o n (19.5 percent), pioneered the securitization o f mortgages in 2002.
The IFC has moved i t s African headquarters to Johannesburg, thereby strengthening i t s
presence in South Africa and o n the continent.

MIGA has marketed i t s investment guarantee services to South African banks,
development agencies and the Export Credit Insurance Corporation o f South Africa. MIGA
actively promotes outbound investment in Africa by South African companies. Consequently,
South Africa i s MIGA’s eighth largest investor country, accounting for US$206.7 m i l l i o n or
4 percent o f the Agency’s gross exposure. The current portfolio o f investments sponsored by
South African investors i s diverse, consisting o f projects in the agribusiness, infrastructure,
manufacturing, and o i l and gas sectors in Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Swaziland and
Uganda. Support for foreign investment into South Africa consists o f one investment.
53.
The W o r l d Bank Institute (WBI), the capacity development arm o f the W o r l d Bank
Group, has been active in South Africa. An average o f about 600 South Africans per year has
participated in a wide range o f training offerings inside and outside South Africa. These
activities resulted in over 53,000 participant training days for South Africans during the
1999-2006 period. However, while the 1999 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) proposed
that South Africa become a priority country for WBI, most i t s activities in South Africa were
regional in nature and few focused exclusively o n South Africa.

EVALUATION
OF PREVIOUS COUNTRY ASSISTANCE
STRATEGY
54.
The Bank has reviewed the 1999 Country Assistance Strategy and i t s impact j o i n t l y
with Government and key stakeholders. It found that the choice o f strategic themes was
highly relevant and based o n a solid diagnosis o f South Africa’s development challenges. I t
concluded that the 1999 C A S was appropriately designed as a knowledge-sharing program,
rather than a lending program. However, the concept o f the Bank as a Knowledge Bank was
relatively new, and the South African C A S was one o f the first to attempt to operationalize it.
Hence, i t s implementation was challenging.
55.
While there was a strong focus o n delivering analytical products for knowledge
transfer, the Bank did not develop the relevant instruments to finance these o n a sustainable
and scaled-up basis. And there remained in the background a continued push for lending,
which, with i t s perceived high transaction costs, was an unattractive option for the
Government.
56.
The review also indicates that the C A S was too vague, lacked selectivity, and most
importantly, did not benefit f r o m strong ownership from the National Treasury, the Bank’s
official counterpart in Government. At times, the Bank failed to understand the specific
needs, and political and social complexities o f the country, while approaching South Africa
as if it were an International Development Agency (IDA) country.

57.
In several cases, the Bank’s response was not fast enough and mostly based o n
individual efforts, without concerted management support. Finally, a number o f opportunities
were missed, including the completion of a j o i n t Country Economic Memorandum, a planned
health project, and a proposed technical assistance loan for implementation support in a

14

number o f key sectors. An evaluation by an internal Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in
2004 concluded that the overall country program was unsatisfactory, while, at the same time,
it rated most individual products satisfactory, and some even highly satisfactory. In other
words, the overall program was less than the sum o f i t s parts. The B a n k also carried out a
client survey described in B o x 3.
Box 3: Clients Survey and NGOs assessment
The World Bank encourages country teams to independently and objectively survey i t s stakeholders in order to
better inform our clients about our strategies and to support client countries in designing and implementing their
development agendas.
In 2005, the World Bank ofice commissioned an independent South African opinion research firm, Research
Surveys, to conduct one-on-one interviews on a confidential basis. Interviewees included officials within National
Treasury and other Government departments, as well as the private sector, the media and broader civil society
representatives.

The results of that initial qualitative survey suggested that many people believe the Bank should be more engaged
in South Africa, and should broaden i t s dialogue and knowledge-sharing with all sectors o f the South African
society. The survey also showed that there are still some misperceptions about how the Bank operates in South
Africa and the nature o f our programs. Overall, it suggested that the Bank has an opportunity to play an enhanced
role in the development debate, provided it plays a partnership role as opposed to a dominant role.
In November 2005 the World Bank office launched a follow-up quantitative questionnaire survey to further test
some o f the previous results with a broader audience. Again, Government representatives were included in this
survey. The results o f the quantitative survey supported the findings o f the qualitative assessment.

T h i s kind o f assessment complements the Bank’s ongoing consultations with the Government and other
stakeholders. I t also provides critical insight into our stakeholders’ views and perceptions. The Bank believes the
results helped us to improve its operations and services in South Africa.

One of the suggestions was to broaden the Bank’s debate with all sectors o f South African society. While World
Bank regularly engage in discussion with a broad range of people in South Africa, a more formalized workshop
with civil society was held in March 2006 to listen and learn, and share knowledge. The Bank believes that, as a
result o f the workshop, civil society groups have a better understandingo f our role in South Africa.
The World Bank country office intends to have a follow-up to the 2005 survey in 2008 to test whether our
strategies have had an impact, whether our engagement has improved and our stakeholders have a better
understandingo f our objectives and programs in South Africa.

CHARACTERIZING THE ENGAGEMENT

58.

Several important lessons have been learned f r o m past experience.

59.

Focus on the Bank’s comparative advantage. South Africa i s a unique client for
the Bank within the Africa region. It i s a large middle income country with sizable o w n
revenues and n o need for significant external financing. It already has substantial internal
public and private capacity in a number o f technical areas. Going forward, therefore, Bank
assistance to South Africa must focus o n those areas in which the B a n k has comparative
advantages acknowledged and valued by Government.
60.
Accelerate decentralization of Bank staff. The areas in w h i c h Bank support has
been most active and valued by Government were areas in which the Bank has had a strong
presence in the country: intergovernmental fiscal systems, urban and municipal development,

15

land reform, and natural resource management. Thus, a higher level o f decentralized Bank
participation in South Africa increases the likelihood o f stronger relationships and hence of a
more successhl outcome.

61.
Be flexible and rapid in response, but within a j o i n t l y agreed program between the
National Treasury, the line ministries and the Bank. The responsive nature o f the previous
C A S did allow the Bank to provide a wide variety o f outputs, but this wide variety also
resulted in imperfect alignment with Government policy processes and priorities, particularly
as defined by the National Treasury. In some cases, B a n k assistance in response to specific
agency requests l e d to work programs that were not within the priorities established by the
National Treasury. The lesson here i s that while responsive knowledge sharing in an
environment o f rapid reforms i s useful, Bank assistance to be effective must be closely
aligned with established Government policy as explicitly endorsed by both l i n e ministries and
National Treasury.

PROPOSED PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
62.
The strategy proposed here sets the stage for a m u c h stronger and more dynamic
partnership, building o n an improvement in the dialogue between the B a n k Group and the
Government o f South Africa since the previous C A S was prepared in 1999. The strategy has
the dual objective o f supporting the national growth and development program and joining
forces and collaborating more closely in key efforts to the benefit o f the regional
development agenda. I t i s primarily a knowledge and technical support partnership that will
be implemented closely with other development partners, in particular the European
Commission.
63.
In an effort to ensure that the Country Partnership Strategy benefited from strong
ownership, the W o r l d Bank Group and the National Treasury carried out the following
consultation process. First, a one day workshop between the t w o was held to agree o n a f i r s t
draft o f the CPS. Second, National Treasury held bilateral consultations with individual
departments w h i c h had, o r requested to develop, a partnership with the Bank. Subsequently, a
“tri-partite” economic and social cluster workshop was held, bringing together the various
departments to make their final input on the document. Third, and in parallel, consultations
were held with c i v i l society and private sector groups.
64.
The Bank’s approach to furthering the development partnership with South Africa
should be seen in the context o f the model being developed for middle-income countries
(“Strengthening the W o r l d Bank’s Engagement with IBRD Partner Counties”, September
2006). This model identifies four ‘business segments’ for developing i t s relationship with
MICs, w h i c h are a l l relevant to the South African context:
strategic policy advice to countries and o n global and regional issues, with matching
convening capacity, increasingly to help address global and regional public goods;
financial services, including a full menu o f financing, credit enhancement and risk
management tools to the sovereign and non-sovereign public sector;

16

knowledge services delivered at the country, sector and global level through a variety
o f delivery mechanisms: research, project cycle, analytical work, training,
institutional capacity building and technical assistance;
loans, equity, structured finance and risk management products, and advisory services
provided to pioneering enterprises in the private sector.

65.

With i t s strong fiscal performance and ready access to international capital markets,
South Africa has made very limited use o f available development assistance and donor
resources as described in previous section^.^' W h i l e IFC’s portfolio has grown to more than
US$340 million, and MIGA has marketed i t s investment guarantee services to South African
banks, the Bank’s program over the past decade has focused almost exclusively o n efforts to
create and share knowledge and assist in building implementation capacity.
66.

The W o r l d Bank Group’s activities under the n e w partnership arrangement will
continue in this mode. However, the Government and the Bank a i m to scale-up these
activities, including using innovative financing mechanisms, and being more strategic and
selective, by more rigorously focusing o n areas that are consistent with the development
priorities o f South Africa and the Bank’s comparative advantage.

67.
Learning f r o m past experience, the B a n k will be flexible and demand-driven, and will
seek to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging needs and to seize opportunities for
building new partnerships. The Government, f r o m i t s perspective, expects the following f r o m
the CPS: a high degree o f coherence between and within programs; demand-driven initiatives
and l e d by South African Government agencies; and initiatives in l i n e with those in other
middle income countries. There i s an inherent tension between the need for strategic
selectivity and demand-driven flexibility. This tension needs to be resolved through
achieving greater ex-ante consensus and ownership around the partnership strategy, o n the
one hand, and o n the other hand by putting in place better coordination mechanisms,
including regular joint reviews o f the w o r k program as it unfolds.

COORDINATIONMECHANISM
68.
With the more flexible nature o f the CPS comes a need for clear guidelines in terms
o f when and where the Bank Group should be engaged in South Africa. The first basis for
any engagement must be concrete demand f r o m South Africa, in consideration o f i t s priority
development agenda. On i t s side, the Bank Group needs to ensure that i t s w o r k in South
Africa meets the Bank’s standards and serves i t s broader goals.
69.
Increased responsiveness will entail a m u c h faster design and delivery o f activities
and tasks. I t i s proposed that a l l tasks and activities are designed in such a w a y that
preparation i s held to less than 12 months, unless a strong rationale exists to do otherwise
(e.g. n e w knowledge generation).
70.
All activities will be identified and agreed in annual business plans and linked to
South Africa’s budget cycle. However, this w o u l d not preclude altering the agreed business

Since 1994, the Government has taken a cautious approach towards expanding aid programs, mindful of the risks o f
aid dependency and conditionality.

plan in response to urgent demands. Attachment 1 includes specific activities agreed for the
fiscal year 2008 (April 2007 to M a r c h 2008). Other planned activities are indicative in nature
and will be confirmed with the Government in the context o f the 2009 and subsequent budget
cycles. Attachment 1 will be reviewed and updated periodically as the program evolves. The
end period for this CPS w o u l d be the Government’s fiscal year 2012, w h i c h ends o n M a r c h
31, 2012.

71.
T o avoid some o f the pitfalls o f the previous CAS, the Government has n o w put in
place a specific institutional mechanism for the coordination o f the Bank’s activities.
Government and the Bank Group will regularly monitor progress o n the annual business
plans through regular assessments (two times per year). The business plans will include a set
o f indicators to monitor progress in their implementation. Assessments will gauge: (i)
the
demand for the Bank Group’s services; (ii)
the relevance and comparative strength o f the
Bank Group’s engagement in the activities under review; (iii)
the quality o f the outputs o r
deliverables; and (iv) the impact o f Bank Group’s contributions.
72.
In addition, a mid-term and a final evaluation o f the CPS will be carried out by an
independent organization.

73.
During the development o f this CPS, the IBRD, IFC, MIGA, F I A S and WBI have
agreed to work together in the identified priority areas, capitalizing o n the comparative
strengths o f each institution. The IBRD will focus o n assistance to enhance public sector
service delivery across a range o f sectors, while IFC and MIGA will focus o n providing
advisory and financial services directly to the private sector. WBI will further align i t s
knowledge and learning services to complement IBRD, IFC and MIGA activities. The Bank
Group plans to conduct bi-annual internal review meetings to coordinate i t s program. In
addition to the reviews needed to meet the Bank’s internal requirements, there will also be
j o i n t Government-Bank reviews, as discussed above.

BANKINSTRUMENTS
74.
As mentioned above, the Bank’s business model in South Africa follows the typical
MIC business segments. The relevant activities are strategic policy advice o n global and
regional issues, knowledge services (research, analytical work, training, institutional capacity
building and technical assistance) and the full range o f IFC and MIGA financial services to
pioneering enterprises in the private sector. Lending to Government could be an option, for
instance as an umbrella instrument to provide technical assistance, as i s currently done under
the Municipal Financial Management Technical Assistance Project.
75.
Bank instruments to b e used are primarily Economic and Sector W o r k (formal reports
and informal policy notes) and technical assistance. The financing sources are the Bank’s
internal budget and grant facilities, and the Government’s o w n budget (co-financed and
reimbursable technical assistance).
76.
The Bank’s sources for financing o f knowledge services are limited. The Bank has
access to a number o f grant facilities. However, the transactions costs involved in accessing
these grants are considerable. The Bank will seek to simplify and streamline i t s fiduciary
processes by further integrating Bank procedures with the Government’s procedures. Another
area where the B a n k has already initiated w o r k to reduce the “hassle factor” relates to

18

environmental and social due diligence requirements w h i c h apply to investment projects,
financed either through grants (e.g., GEF, Montreal Protocol, Carbon Fund) o r lending. An
assessment has been carried out, with the objective to use South Africa safeguards country
system, instead o f the Bank’s. This approach will be tested out in the next GEF operation.

77.
The Government has indicated i t s willingness to increasingly deploy i t s o w n budget
to finance Bank knowledge services. Fee-for-Service technical assistance i s an instrument
under which the Bank’s direct and overhead costs o f advisory, research o r training/capacity
building services are covered by the Government. I t can be undertaken o n a case-by-case
basis, o r under an umbrella agreement. Significant experience with this instrument has been
gained in the countries o f the Gulf Cooperation Council3’ and in some L a t i n American
countries, covering areas such as privatization advisory services, f r o m feasibility studies to
transactions; consulting/advisory services to improve public services; assessments o f housing
subsidy programs and recommendations for restructuring and targeting; and the development
o f Government capacity to initiate and manage public-private partnerships (PPP).
78.
The above combination o f Bank budget, existing grants and Fee-for-Service technical
assistance represents the base case scenario for a strategy focused o n knowledge generation
and sharing and capacity-building. If, however, considerably more resources become
available-a high case scenario-the choice o f activities under the current pillars and themes
w o u l d not materially change. Instead, the volume and quality o f the knowledge services
provided would substantially rise, because the increased resource envelope would allow a
more intensive use o f teams composed o f Bank staff f r o m i t s global technical networks and
other regions, and world-class international and local consultants.
79.
The Government and the Bank will w o r k together to mobilize the appropriate
mechanisms, including trust fbnds, to ramp up knowledge and capacity building support for
South Africa, including for regional partnerships. To provide a substantial boost in technical
support to South Africa, new instruments could be opened to other development partners as
well, following the principles o f the Paris Declaration. In effect, this CPS calls for initiating a
higher level o f collaboration between the development partners than currently exists.

BANKGROUP
AND PARTNERS
80.
To ensure better complementarity and prevent duplication o f efforts, there has to be
more effective coordination and partnering with South African and external stakeholders.
These stakeholders include the private sector, labor unions, youth and c i v i l society
organizations, as w e l l as the various bilateral and multilateral development partners (e.g.
DFID, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the German
Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Danish Development Agency, the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA), Finland, the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), Australian Aid, the European Union, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the
African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)). L e d by
Government, a more systematic process o f coordination will need to be put in place to
support this CPS.

30

Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and the Sultanate o f Oman.

19

8 1.
Several k e y factors have l e d to less than ideal donor coordination and cooperation in
South Africa during the previous CAS. First, Government’s success in mobilizing ever
increasing o w n revenues has dampened demand for large quantities o f external financing.
Second, donors were far more focused o n aligning their programs with those o f Government
than o n harmonizing efforts and partnering among themselves. Third, in the absence o f
substantial multi-donor partnerships, Government officials often assessed the transactions
costs o f dealing with individual donors as too high while seeing only limited benefits.
82.
However, several donors currently have substantial assistance programs in South
Africa a n d o r are using South Africa as a regional hub. Going forward, the Bank intends to
partner much more with these donors and p o o l resources to be able to reach the necessary
scale and quality o f assistance to South Africa. These areas will include both South Africaspecific and Africa-wide activities. Without these new partnerships, the Bank Group will
simply not be able to effectively respond to the requests made by South Africa as enunciated
in this CPS.

BANKGROUP
STRATEGY PILLARS AND THEMES
83.
The following sections contain an overview o f the proposed key priority areas for the
CPS. Additional details can be found in Attachment 1. These priority areas have been
determined by the fundamental policy challenges facing the South African Government,
namely the need to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.
84.
The activities described in this CPS are clustered around two pillars and a crosscutting theme. The two pillars are: (i)urban and rural development; and (ii)regional
integration. The cross-cutting theme i s ‘capacity-building for public service delivery. ’ The
sections that follow describe the initial activities under the CPS. As mentioned before
(par. 70) the program beyond fiscal year 2008 (April 2007-March 2008) will be determined
as part o f the annual business planning exercise. The anticipated outcomes o f the CPS are
presented in Attachment 1. These will also be revised and fine-tuned in the annual business
planning process.

P I L L A R 1:URBAN AND

RURAL
DEVELOPMENT

85.
The first priority area o f W o r l d Bank engagement i s clustered around the theme o f
urban and rural development and aims to support several o f the k e y areas targeted by
ASGISA. These include supporting areas in which the Bank has been active over the last
several years such as urban and municipal development, land reform, agriculture,
environment and private sector development. Urban development assistance will be increased
considerably. A new area o f engagement i s infrastructure.
On-going areas of support
86.
The Bank’s 15 years o f engagement in South Africa in the area o f urban and
municipal development i s generally regarded as productive. T h e on-going Municipal
Financial Management Technical Assistance Project supports National Treasury’s roll-out o f
the Municipal Finance Management Act. In addition to supporting the placement o f 40
experienced municipal financial management experts (supplemented by the UK Department
for International Development (DFID) funding for 6 additional experts) in local Governments
throughout the country, the program also supports an internship program, an array o f policy
reforms, and improvements in intergovernmental fiscal monitoring system^.^'

87.
M a k i n g cities, including small cities and faster growing towns, more inclusive also
means re-engineering the often very complex, centralized and silo-driven delivery o f the k e y
infrastructure programs which target the poor. The Bank will leverage the experience gained
under two “mature” programs (municipal development and land reform) to support
municipalities to simplify the various grant programs and restructure their land use so that
more efficiently-located affordable housing, public transport and other k e y infrastructure
projects can be implemented faster and more effectively. This means re-engineering the
business processes o f project planning, approval and management; simplifying land use
planning, regulation and management; providing practical guidelines for more decentralized
and unified budgeting and financial management systems at the local government level; and
facilitating the involvement o f the private sector in the financing o f pro-poor infrastructure
projects.
88.
Land reform and agriculture i s a longstanding area o f engagement for the Bank in
South Africa, and one in w h i c h significant work has been done in partnership with
Government agencies. Despite significant reforms that have been undertaken, major
challenges remain in areas where the Bank can contribute. These include bringing land
restitution to closure by 2008, accelerating and improving the impact o f land reform,
promoting small-scale commercial agriculture, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation.

89.
The two departments involved (Land Affairs and Agriculture) have requested the
Bank to provide a technical assistance facility to support the priority development agenda in
land reform and agriculture. This program will cover a three year period, and will be fully
funded by the Government as Fee-for-Service Technical Assistance.

South Africa”, Africa Region Working Paper No. 98, World Bank.

90.
In monetary terms, the Bank’s environment portfolio i s the largest area of
engagement in South Africa. There i s an active GEF portfolio o f seven projects, worth over
US$40 million, and another US$15 m i l l i o n in the pipeline. L o o k i n g ahead, the Bank plans to
continue to support South Africa’s conservation o f i t s biodiversity and i t s fight against land
degradation and desertification. However, the focus o f this portfolio will shift even more
towards creating local jobs, skills development and other benefits, linked to sustainable
development. This w o u l d include community-based natural resource management, energy
efficient l o w income housing and clean household energy, and waste management/
minimization and recycling. The Bank i s also preparing support to fisheries management as
part o f a regional program. Finally, the Bank will support pollution management in South
Africa as part o f a continent-wide program to dispose o f obsolete pesticides and as part of a
local program to phase out ozone depleting substances.
91.
Climate change i s another important area of engagement. South Africa i s one o f
the most significant emitters o f carbon dioxide (C02) in the developing word, due to the size
o f i t s economy and i t s heavy reliance o n coal-based energy generation. In addition, because
o f i t s vulnerability to drought and land degradation, i t faces greater challenges than other
countries in dealing with and adapting to the impact o f climate change. As part o f the follow
up to the Gleneagles (G8+5) initiative, it i s proposed that B a n k support in this area include
some o f the following: (i)
a review o f options and costs to implement a low-carbon growth
strategy, (ii)
preparation o f an adaptation strategy for rural areas, with a particular focus o n
the poor, (iii)
a strategy for mainstreaming climate change adaptation strategies into the water
sector, (iv) implementation o f the national strategy to promote energy efficiency, (v) support
the national renewable energy program, including with a GEF grant; (vi) development o f the
carbon finance market through the purchase o f carbon credits; and (vii) development o f
appliance regulations and housing standards.

92.
W o r l d Bank Group engagement in the area o f private sector development would
build o n the Bank’s past w o r k in South Africa, in particular, the Bank’s earlier
Competitiveness Project and the recent Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) o f the formal
sector, the Microenterprise Investment Climate Assessment (MICA), the assessment of
Department o f Trade and Industry’s business development incentive programs, and the w o r k
by FIAS. The ongoing engagements by the IFC and MIGA with the South African private
sector are strong platforms to build on.
93.
Experience elsewhere in M i d d l e Income Countries suggests that the Bank Group’s
comparative advantage in private sector development lies in the financing and planning o f
public-private partnerships in infrastructure; identifying, and helping to remove, constraints
to doing business (competition and regulatory frameworks, r e d tape); promoting foreign
direct investment; SMEs development and integration into the formal economy; and training
and skills development, with a particular focus o n SMEs.

94.
The IBRD’s current program with the Department o f Trade and Industry includes
support for the creation o f a monitoring and evaluation “dashboard” for the Department’s
m a i n projects and programs and those o f i t s key agencies. The Department o f Trade and
Industry has also asked the Bank to help in the short t e r m with the design o f a full monitoring
and impact evaluation system for the Department and i t s agencies and to help design and
implement an impact evaluation system for the recently enacted Black Economic
Empowerment codes for Small Medium Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).

22

95.
Additional analytical w o r k planned by the Bank for the coming years includes
follow-up analysis, and repeat, o f the 2005 ICA and MICA to deepen the knowledge of (i)
the impact o f exchange rate volatility o n exporters; (ii)
the impact o f labor regulations and
s k i l l s development programs o n employment and economic activity at the lower end o f the
income scale; and (iii)
the impact o f H I V / A I D S o n firm level costs and productivity.
96.
IFC’s current strategy in South Africa has one basic premise and three prongs. The
premise i s that South Africa has a very w e l l developed financial sector, and that IFC should
not compete for normal, local corporate business. The three prongs are (i)
actively support
South African companies “going north” and “going global”; (ii)
provide advice and financing
within South Africa where there are underserved niches in the local market and where I F C
can bring value added that complements local capabilities; and (iii)provide technical
assistance and related support for small business, with a focus o n the informal sector and
education. (See Attachment 3 for more details).

97.
At the request o f the National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service, F I A S
i s currently finalizing a study o n the tax burden in k e y sectors o f the economy and has started
a related project to document the tax compliance costs for small businesses in South Africa.
98.
The current portfolio o f the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
creates opportunities to assist South African f i r m s to invest in the rest o f Africa. Presently,
MIGA i s preparing to underwrite two South African investments in agribusiness and
telecommunications in the Democratic Republic o f Congo and Republic o f Congo, with a
potential gross exposure o f US$125 million. Finally, MIGA and the Bank’s Foreign
Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) provide technical assistance to the Department o f
Trade and Industry to promote foreign direct investment into the country. In t e r m s o f
technical assistance, MIGA i s working jointly with FIAS to support the Department o f Trade
and Industry in developing a strategy and structure to promote foreign direct investment
flows to South Africa as part o f i t s growth strategy.
New Area for Support

99.
Infrastructure.There has been increasing recognition within South Africa that new
infrastructure investment i s needed in key areas in order to accelerate economic growth and
to continue to rectify past inequities in service. Under ASGISA, massive investment in
infrastructure has been identified as a k e y driver o f growth. In addition, preparations for the
20 10 W o r l d Cup include substantial spending o n infrastructure.
100. The Bank will build o n w o r k undertaken since 2005 in the area o f infrastructure and
growth, including a three-day workshop co-sponsored by the National Treasury and the Bank
o n Infrastructure and Growth hosted by Economic Research South Africa (University o f
Cape Town). At the request o f the National Treasury, the Bank has helped initiate and i s a
part o f a comprehensive, independent review o f the infrastructure regulatory framework in
the context o f the on-going utilities’ reforms. After an initial assessment undertaken by a
Bank team o n the energy sector, the Bank currently assists with an assessment o f competition
and regulation in several infrastructure sectors (energy, telecommunications, and
transportation). T h i s policy study i s conducted by an independent team o f international and
local experts, under the leadership o f an inter-departmental committee, chaired by National
Treasury. The Bank will mobilize a team o f independent international experts, and will

23

provide review inputs as requested. I t i s intended that the policy study will act a catalyst for
accelerating institutional, structural, and regulatory reforms to improve operating efficiency,
service coverage and quality. The Bank also intends to place an energy expert in the Pretoria
Country Office.

PILLAR 2: REGIONAL
INTEGRATION
101. Under this pillar, the strategy proposes three clusters o f activities in which South
Africa and the World Bank Group will j o i n forces in supporting o f the rest o f Africa:
(i)
facilitating South Africa’s private and public companies to invest in Africa; (ii)
building
regional communities, starting with SADC; and (iii)
sharing knowledge in support o f Africa.
O n the regional agenda, the Bank intends to work very closely with other development
partners, in particular with DFID.
102. Facilitating South Africa’s companies to invest in Africa. IFC and MIGA both
have large, successful, and growing portfolios that actively support South African
companies’ (private and public) investments in the rest o f Africa. The World Bank Group i s
also cooperating with South African companies on public-private partnerships in regional
infrastructure projects such as SADC electricity generation and transmission projects (e.g.
Southern Africa Power Pool, Inga power), the East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy)
fiber optic cable network and Kudu gas.
103. Building regional communities, starting with SADC. The Government requested
the Bank to specifically focus on the implementation o f the SADC Regional Indicative
Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), in particular by assisting in the creation o f regional
free trade areas and customs unions, the facilitation o f investment in regional infrastructure,
the strengthening o f regional financial markets and capacity building o f regional institutions.
Currently, and building on the Bank’s comparative advantage, the Government has requested
cross-country comparative work within SADC on trade, business climate and public finance
(budget management and expenditure reviews). The Bank will draw on i t s existing country
data and analytical work to produce such comparative studies. This work will assist SADC to
monitor and strengthen the commitments made on regional integration.

104. Sharing knowledge in support of Africa. The World Bank Group and particularly
the World Bank Institute (WBI) will scale up targeted capacity building assistance for South
Africa and use South Africa as a hub for the rest o f the region. The regional engagement will
focus on strengthening interaction with South African institutions to both share international
practices with South African counterparts, as well as partner for information and knowledge
sharing across Africa. The objective o f the Bank’s Africa Action Plan i s to harness and
deploy world-class South African, other African, and international expertise to scale-up
support for Africa’s development agenda. The plan forms a significant part o f the Joint
Conclusions between the Bank and the Department o f Science and Technology and i s also
aligned to the African Union/NEPAD Science and Technology Consolidated Plan o f Action.
105. Better dissemination o f the Bank’s knowledge products will be vital to this steppedup engagement. In the past, outreach and communications were constrained by inexperience
in playing the role o f a “knowledge” Bank and by limited staff resources. However, given
South Africa’s role as an “opinion hub” for Africa, a new strategy for proactive knowledgesharing and dissemination o f information will be implemented.

24

106. The Bank will strengthen partnerships and outreach by participating in knowledgesharing events and activities, projects and other programs in the country that underscore our
commitment as a development partner. Existing partnerships with the Development Bank o f
Southern Africa (DBSA) and the Human Science Research Council (HSRC) will be
deepened. The Bank will also engage in more frequent dialogue with c i v i l society, including
NGOs, the private sector, research and academic institutions.
107. The W o r l d Bank Group will consistently seek to build partnerships with existing
regional institutions: the African Union, NEPAD, S A D C and i t s associated regional
institutions, such as the Development Finance Resource Centre and the Development Bank o f
Southern Africa. One o f the immediate priority areas here i s statistical capacity building.
Other priority areas include facilitating private-public partnerships for regional infrastructure
(partners: D B S A and SADC), supporting the Parliamentary Network o n the W o r l d Bank
(together with the African Development Bank), and developing an Africa-wide Affiliated
Network for Social Accountability (with the Human Sciences Research Council). Other focus
areas include: budget management (with the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative CABR132),science and technology (with the Department o f Science and Technology) trade
(with S A C U and SADC), business and investment promotion, regional health threats such as
HIV/AIDS, and land policy (with SADC, UNDP and

Informing other stakeholders
108. The Bank has established a Development Information Center in Johannesburg with
the South African Institute o f International Affairs. The a i m i s to engage stakeholders and
c i v i l society in the development debate and provide easy access to a broad range o f
development information. The Bank i s exploring possibilities to establish similar
development information centers for the Western Cape, the Vaal Triangle and Soweto.
109. The W o r l d Bank South Africa Country Office has i t s o w n website at
www.worldbank.org/southafrica which includes the latest information o n Bank events and
publications, and a quarterly “newsletter service.”

110. The media play a vital role in South Africa and the W o r l d Bank considers media a
key component in i t s communications strategy. In recent years coverage o f the Bank has
increased qualitatively and quantitatively as more media seek B a n k views o n development
topics. The Bank i s also undertaking a community radio project that has a focus o n service
delivery.

CROSS-CUTTING THEME

111. With regard to the cross-cutting theme - capacity building for public service deliverythe nature o f the collaboration between the Government and the Bank will be determined

largely through a demand-driven process emanating f r o m departments and other Government
agencies.
112. Some o f the capacity-building assistance to b e provided by the Bank will come with
the technical assistance that will be provided in the various sectors (e.g. education, social
welfare reform). Other capacity building initiatives will derive from specific departmental
requests. For instance, with the National Treasury, capacity-building in macroeconomic
modeling will be used to simulate various policy choices for South Africa, but also be used as
a platform to support regional economic modeling capacity. In other sectors, capacitybuilding includes collaborating o n the delivery o f specific training courses (e.g. the land
policy training courses).
113. The Reserve Asset Management Program (RAMP) deserves special mention as a
relatively recent and unknown area o f capacity-building (See B o x 4).
Box 4: World Bank assistance to the South African Reserve Bank ( S A R B )
The World Bank’s RAMP i s designed to build capacity in reserves management operations in central banks. As
part o f the RAMP engagement, which normally lasts three years, World Bank Treasury specialists provide on-site
consulting and training to central bank staff in various aspects o f reserves management such as portfolio
management, risk management, use of analytical tools, operations, accounting, legal issues, information
technology, etc. The advisory services are combined with an asset management program designed to support the
overall technology transfer objectives o f the program.
The South AErican Reserve Bank joined RAMP on November 30, 2005. As part o f the engagement, the World
Bank Treasury i s managing a part o f S A R B ’ s foreign currency reserves both as a platform for know-how transfer
as well as a financing mechanism for the capacity building activities. The latter comprise advisory and consulting
on asset management operations and staff training through participation in practical workshops, internships at
World Bank Headquarters and finance training through underwriting staff participation in the Chartered Financial
Analyst (CFA) and other professional finance programs.
I

114. WBI has n o w designated South Africa as a focus country for i t s activities. It has a
dedicated country budget with which to support the development and delivery o f targeted,
multi-year knowledge services in South Africa. Under the CPS framework, annually agreed
activity programs will guide the scaling-up o f W B I ’ s assistance. The immediate activities for
the WBI program in South Africa are: (i)local government and service delivery, in
partnership with the Department o f Provincial and Local Government and the Cities
Network; (ii)
education, in partnership with the Department o f Education and the Department
of Science and Technology, with a particular focus on science, math and statistics. The Bank
i s also partnering with the Department o f Science and Technology in introducing and
supporting measures that promote science and technology for poverty alleviation and
sustainable development in South Africa and the African continent; and (iii)social
protection, with the South African Social Security Agency and the Department o f Social
Development, focusing o n social grants.
RISK ASSESSMENT

115. South Africa’s current ability to absorb external shocks without serious economic
repercussions i s substantial, reflected in i t s sovereign rating o f BBB+ (shared with the
Russian Federation, Bulgaria and Thailand). The free floating rand provides a f i r s t line o f
defense against external shocks, while the public and the private sector assets are not

26

significantly exposed to foreign exchange rate risks. As mentioned earlier, unlike many other
emerging markets, South Africa comfortably borrows off-shore, mainly to establish
benchmarks for South African corporations to borrow abroad. At the same time, the domestic
market remains the primary source o f Government borrowing. Due to a sophisticated
domestic market, South Africa has a l o w level o f debt denominated in foreign currencies34
and boasts a sound and deep banking system. As a result, South Africa dealt with a sharp fall
in the value o f the rand in 2001-2002 without major adverse effects o n economic growth.
116. However, risks do exist. South Africa has been a “commodity play” in the last years,
causing the exchange rate to closely track international commodity prices. I t s current account
deficit i s high and increasingly financed by portfolio equity flows; while household debt i s
rising fast fueled by l o w interest rates.
117. Although reserves are at a historical high o f about US$28 billion, they are s t i l l
somewhat l o w by international standards (equivalent to 3.5 months o f imports), while exports
as a percentage o f GDP are also not very high at around 30 percent. Hence, a combination o f
falling commodity prices, higher interest rates in developed countries and a surge in imports,
driven by the massive infrastructure investment planned under ASGISA, w o u l d exert strong
pressure o n the current account deficit and m a y lead to a substantial depreciation o f the
currency. This scenario, despite being potentially beneficial to exports, could trigger
inflation, which w o u l d lead the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates to meet i t s inflation
target. This in turn could cause an economic contraction, choking o f f the export supply
response needed to avoid a full-fledged recession. To help mitigate these risks, the W o r l d
Bank Group’s private sector development strategy strongly supports an increased export push
in the non-commodity sectors.
118. W o r l d Bank Group’s strategy, with i t s strong focus o n shared growth and reducing
poverty, inequality, and unemployment i s therefore appropriately focused. This would
arguably also have an impact o n reducing crime, which i s s t i l l at very high levels even
though some crime numbers have been declining. There i s also growing concern, including
within the ANC, about corruption trends. The current strategy w o u l d address this risk
through i t s emphasis o n increased participation, transparency and accountability across
sectors and spheres o f Government.
119. T o minimize the risk o f lack o f ownership by the Government o f South Africa, the
current strategy has been prepared j o i n t l y with the South African Government, and i s based
o n consultations with the private sector, c i v i l society and line ministries, and l e d by National
Treasury. It provides a clear strategic framework and commits the partners to a regular and
practical coordination mechanism.

According IMF, the ratio o f total external debt to gross domestic product increased from 19.1 percent at the end o f
2005 to 22.4 percent at the end o f 2006, and will settle at 21.7 percent in 2007 According to Global Development
Finance 2005, external debt in Middle Income Countries, in 2003, accounted on average, for about 39 percent o f
national income.
34

27

CONCLUSION
120. The Bank Group recognizes that i t s partnership with South Africa must reflect the
country’s status as a middle income country. In this regard, therefore, the Bank will focus o n
i t s comparative advantage to provide ‘knowledge services’ as requested by South African
Government departments within the framework o f the partnership strategy described above.

121. This partnership strategy provides for a range o f ongoing and new activities to assist
the South African Government address the challenges o f growth, employment creation and
poverty eradication. In addition, the Bank can play a vital role in fostering integration in the
broader Southern African region and beyond, o n the African continent. In this regard, the
W o r l d Bank Institute will play a k e y role in training and broader capacity building initiatives.
122.

The services provided by the W o r l d Bank Group in this regard are likely to extend to
a l l four business segments o f the relationship with MICs (namely strategic policy advice,
financial services, knowledge services, and loans, equity and structured finance products).
The South African Government i s o f the opinion that the Bank can add value and provide
innovation. This j o i n t CPS ensures that f i t u r e initiatives reflect South African realities and
that the developed solutions are homegrown.

THE

CAS COMPLETION REPORT

This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the extent to
which the 1999 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for South Africa3’ achieved i t s intended
results and draws lessons for building a stronger collaboration between the Government and the
W o r l d Bank Group. The report i s organized in five parts:
1.

and summary conclusions;

11. Review o f South Africa’s political and economic picture, long-term strategic goals,
and progress on achieving development objectives;

beyond the immediate self-assessment. In the CASCR preparation process, over 30 Bank staff,
who had been involved in the country at any stage during the 1999-2006 period, were
interviewed. In addition, Government officials (including parastatals) and local representatives o f

c i v i l society, media, academia, private sector, and all major development partners3’ provided
feedback. The team benefited from the input o f two independent consultants selected by the
World Bank and the National Treasury. Elevating this self-assessment to a joint GovernmentBank review adds substantial value to the exercise and helps to get a better understanding o f the
relationship, constraints, and Bank relevance in South Afiica. The process has proved to be

the future.
Particularities and limitations of the CASCR. The 1999 CAS was the first ever for
South Africa and was presented to the Board o f Directors in M a y o f that year envisioning a threeyear program (FY2000-2002). However, attempts to write a new strategy failed. Thus the current
CASCR assesses the extended period until June 2006. The 1999 CAS was developed at a time
when the current results-based approach, with i t s pillars for meeting development objectives, was
not demanded by Bank guidelines. The broad scope was deliberate due to the fact that the 1999
CAS envisaged the creation o f a knowledge partnership, a rather new concept for Bank
engagement in IBRD countries. The CAS formulation was complicated by the specific context of
the Bank-Government relationship and the political sensitivities. The CAS was to be
implemented through a program based almost exclusively o n knowledge products that are
traditionally difficult to monitor and evaluate in terms o f their contribution toward results. This
was explicitly mentioned in the CAS section o n measuring results. Assessing the outcomes and
impact has therefore proven to be challenging as n o specific measurable indicators were
developed.
3.

Self-evaluation conclusions. This CASCR concludes that while there has been
considerable improvement in the last couple o f years in delivering timely, demand-driven
products, discernible progress toward reaching the original targets i s limited. The overall Bank
performance for the period under review (1999-2006) should be rated as moderately
unsatisfactory. Despite individual products o f good quality, the goals under all three pillars were
only partially achieved. This self-evaluation i s consistent with the 2004 QAG AAA assessment,
which rated overall Bank performance as unsatisfactory (discussed further in Section IV).

SOUTH AFRICA AND THE

South Africa-Political

1999 CAS

and Economic Transition

5.
Since the first democratic elections in South Africa in 1994 after decades o f apartheid
regime, the governments o f the African National Congress (ANC) have set out a course o f stable
economic development.
Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP). An overarching framework that
guides all policy and strategy work in South Africa was adopted in 1996. The key objectives o f
the RDP are (a) meeting basic needs, (b) building the economy, (c) developing human resources,
and (d) democratizing the state. South Africa’s role in regional development for the next ten years
includes the country’s involvement in international cooperation and implementing the New
Partnership for Africa ’s Development (NEPAD).40
6.

7.
Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy. By introducing the GEAR
strategy, the Government committed to open markets, privatization and working toward a
stronger investment climate. The strategy was designed to cover the period 1996-2000 w i t h the
ambitious goals o f achieving sustained annual real GDP growth o f 6 percent in four years, cut

fiscal deficit to 3 percent o f GDP by 2001, while creating 400,000 new jobs each year mainly
through increased foreign direct investment.

Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA). The Government
o f South Africa recently committed to a complimentary economic plan, ASGISA41. The core
objectives o f the initiative are to halve poverty and unemployment by 2014 through accelerated
growth o f 4.5 percent or higher through 2009 and at least 6 percent during 2010 and 2014.
8.

World Bank Engagement in South Africa
In i t s most recent history, the engagement with South Africa has traversed three phases.
9.
Phase I, Low key. In the early 1990s a low-key informal dialogue was instrumental in
bringing international experience to South African stakeholders who had been isolated from the
rest o f the world due to sanctions under apartheid rule. The new incoming government officials
were faced with a challenge to build a nation and to j o i n the global market. During that period o f
re-engagement, W o r l d Bank staff did background analytical work that was publishedin the South
Africa Discussion Paper Series. The A N C interns program funded with help from several donors
was critical in bringing potential leaders to the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.,
where they enjoyed six-month training sessions and work o n various international operations.
This period o f interaction i s acknowledged as having been influential at the country policy level,
and initiated an important relationship o f knowledge transfer, built o n trust and strong personal
communication, between Bank staff and A N C members.
10.
Phase 2, Focus on economic stabilization and legislation. During the mid-l990s, the
new democratic Government, which took power in 1994, focused on economic stabilization and
legislation. W h i l e the Bank continued a l o w profile engagement (during which time in fact staff
provided input and technical support to crafting the GEAR strategy), the new Government
leadership had taken a stance o f keeping “donor dependence” to a minimum. Negative
perceptions persisted about the Bank’s conditionalities and in adjustment lending, which,
according to these views, were to blame for poor performance in other A f i x a n countries. The
World Bank was unpopular. As a result, while unofficial advice was sought, Government was
not eager to openly interact with the Bank as it saw this as a precursor to lending. After the 1999
elections, the Government, with renewed confidence after the remarkable transition and the first
five years o f democracy, was eager to show the world that the new “rainbow nation” could go it
alone. At the same time, Government s t i l l had limitations. Although many believed that the Bank
had a lot to offer, it was kept at a distance in a Government effort to steer the economy without
outside interventions. By that time it had become clear that the GEAR strategy, although
successful in creating greater financial discipline and macroeconomic stability, had not made
enough progress in other key areas such as employment and reducing the gap between the first
and the second economies.

4’

ASGISA had the following aims: implement an infrastructure investment program by increasing public sector
investment to 8 percent; implement sector strategies including a broader National Industrial Policy with three priority
sectors- tourism, business process outsourcing, and biofuels; further develop skills; eliminate the second economy by
increased public expenditure to develop small business; address macro-economic issues including strategies to reduce
the volatility and overvaluation of the currency ensuring inflation targeting regime o f fiscal and monetary policy for
sustained and shared growth; and focus on good governance and institutional interventions.

43

The 1999 CAS. Under these circumstances, after almost one year o f substantial team
11.
effort, the Bank finished the first-ever CAS for South Africa. The primary objective o f the Bank’s
assistance to South Africa was to help reduce the apartheid legacy o f poverty and inequality. The
CAS had three major development objectives (or pillars): (a) promoting higher growth and
employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability in order to generate sustained
improvements in living standards; (b) fostering social and environmental sustainability by
reducing poverty and inequality through investment in human and natural capital, accelerating
and improving the delivery o f assets and services to the disadvantaged segments o f society, and
enhancing environmental management; and (c) strengthening South Africa ’s constructive role in
regional development through regional investment projects, improved policy integration, and
coordinated external relations. The CAS introduced the idea o f piloting the concept o f a
knowledge bank in South Africa, which called for “programmatic flexibility.”
12.
Skepticism toward Bank. At the time the CAS was presented to the Board, the dialogue
between the Bank and South Africa had not matured to a relationship o f understanding and trust.
Thus the CAS was crafted without major input and buy-in from Government or other
stakeholders and was followed by efforts to promote analytic (and lending) program to achieve
what the CAS called a knowledge partnership in the absence o f a defined partner. Throughout the
CAS period (1999-2002), the Bank tried to engage the Government but did not find suitable
instruments, and lending was o n and o f f the agenda. In response, the Government treated the
Bank as an “unwelcome suitor.” Unsuccessful attempts to reopen dialogue o n developing a new
country strategy (2002-2003) were not met with enthusiasm. The Government’s skepticism
toward the Bank had not been dispelled.
13.
Phase 3, Remerging dialogue and regaining lost terrain since 2004. The most recent
relationship, which coincided with changes in the Bank’s Africa Region management and the
critical Q A G country AAA assessment, has witnessed a more expressed interest by Government
to seek dialogue and technical support. T h e Bank was a key partner at the early stages o f
ASGISA and has expanded dialogue to new areas and stakeholders. The Bank responded by
quickly decentralizing staff and mobilizing resources (rapid response fund) to engage and provide
support to Government, which o n i t s part has also been more interested in partnering with the
Bank.

South Africa Progress toward Achieving Development Objectives
14.

South Africa has made progress toward achieving development objectives as measured

by the three CAS development objectives or pillars.
CAS Pillar l-Output and employment growth
15.
Economic progress. There i s evidence o f progress toward building the economy despite
missing many o f the GEAR targets-achieving
a 6 percent GDP growth and a 4.3 percent
employment growth rate by 2000. The progress was evident by a declining budget deficit, turning
a comer from negative per capita growth in the decade before 1994 to an average annual growth
o f 2.8 percent between 1994 and 2003. Real GDP growth reached 4.9 percent in 2005, inflation
has remained within the target for over two years. However, the current account deficit rose to
4.2 percent o f GDP in 2005 (Table Bl).42

42

16.
Private investment. Private investment has been growing at a relatively healthy 5.9
percent per year over the last ten years accounting for 71 percent o f total gross fixed investment
in the economy in 2005. T h i s i s a reflection o f sound macroeconomic policies, largely businessfriendly, a constructive dialogue between Government and business, and a relatively good
investment climate.43

CAS Pillar 2-Social and environmental sustainability
Social sustainability There are s t i l l challenges to meet in achieving social sustainability
despite South Africa making progress in i t s long-term development objectives and basic
and reaching the Millennium Development Goals. Government economic policies have freed
resources for social expenditure. With regard to social trends in terms o f provision o f electricity,
clean water, sanitation, and telecommunications, there has been steady improvement and the
number o f extremely poor households has been declining since 2002 (Figure 1). The expansion
o f social grants expenditure in the last four years was an unprecedented R22 billion in real terms
totaling n o w R70 billion and nearly 11 m i l l i o n South Africans n o w receive social grants.45
However, poverty alleviation i s s t i l l an uphill struggle and human resource scarcity i s one o f the
main binding constraints to achieving higher levels o f economic growth. In addition, despite
recent mobilization in the response to H N and increased expenditures for antiretroviral drug
therapy, the AIDS epidemic has taken i t s toll, bringing about decline in l i f e expectancy to 45 in
2005, increased healthcare spending, labor productivity loss, absenteeism, loss o f skilled labor,
and orphaned children.46

Environmental sustainability.
There has been considerable progress o n the

identifying economic instruments to complement regulation that promotes sound environmental
management. Because o f South Africa’s unique and r i c h biodiversity, as well as i t s potential for
nature-based tourism development and j o b creation, considerable effort has gone to support
conservation o f natural resources, leading to some 6 percent o f the country’s land area being
managed in the form o f land- and marine-protected areas4’

sustainable growth and poverty eradication. South Africa has taken a lead in key regional
infrastructure projects (e.g., Maputo Corridor). South African investment in the rest o f the
continent has boomed with several o f i t s private companies (MNT and Vodacom mobile
operators, Protea hotel chain, Standard and ABSA banks) successfully expanding across Africa.

ASSESSMENT
OF CAS OUTCOMES

This section looks at each o f the three development objectives (pillars) and their outcomes as
identified in the 1999 CAS.

Pillar l-Output and employment growth
20.
The CAS vision. The 1999 CAS identified employment and growth creation as the most
pressing challenges for South Africa. The main reference was the Government’s 1996 GEAR
strategy (developed with Bank assistance). Although the period 1996-99 was successful in
creating greater financial discipline and macroeconomic stability, much less progress was made
in employment creation and reducing the gap between the first and the second economy. The
main indicators chosen by the 1999 CAS to measure progress for this pillar show clear success o f
monetary and fiscal policy to reduce inflation and contain the fiscal deficit, allowing decline in
real interest rates. There was also a moderate improvement in growth performance although not
nearly as much as hoped by the authorities. The real exchange rate, however, appreciated after
2001 thereby constraining growth o f exports and real output.

Conclusion. While the Bank’s knowledge interventions were not formalized in standard
Bank documents, there were a series o f publications, papers, conferences, seminars and issueoriented events that kept the dialogue alive throughout the period under review. W h i l e their
individual contribution may have been modest, cumulatively and with a lag, the work has
deepened the knowledge o n development problems as recognized by South African academia, a
major user and partner in these activities. Although the Bank produced a series o f good quality
and relevant analytic pieces, as indicated by the 2004 Q A G report, and subsequent publications
(see Attachment B3), their overall impact o n policy or institutional changes in the area o f growth
and employment remain at best modest and limited given the client’s l o w engagement, and lack
o f agreed partnership framework. At the same time jointly initiated activities in 2005 and 2006

(growth and jobs workshop, investment climate assessment, government-wide monitoring and
impact evaluation workshop) have yielded good results, and recent dialogue and demand for
reimbursable technical assistance are a s i g n o f potentially more promising interaction.

Outcome 1.1-Macro management
Research and dialogue. Macroeconomic policy research and dialogue were maintained
throughout the period under review and strengthened during 2005-06 (Box Bl). Substantive work
was done by the Bank with the National Treasury o n a joint country economic memorandum
CEM, which did not materialize as originally envisaged for a variety o f reasons including the
transitional and organizational changes related to a new country team at the Bank, as well as l o w
interest from a middle-income country for formal and traditional economic and sector work
(ESW). The C E M however was subsequently modified and issued as W o r l d Bank policy
research papers o n aspects o f growth, industrial concentration, and export competitiveness. In
2005 and 2006 policy research papers o n value added tax analysis, infi-astructure benchmarking,
infrastructure investment needs, and an electricity sector review were produced in collaboration
with leading South African researchers.
22.

23.
Capacity building on economic modeling. Since the mid-l990s, the Bank and the
National Treasury have jointly developed appropriate economic frameworks for policy making
(e.g. the South Africa macro-econometric model (SAMM). Renewing the history o f joint
modeling exercise in 2003, the National Treasury and the World Bank began to develop a multisector, computable general (CGE) model for South Africa. As illustration o f i t s potential uses and
part o f the documentation, the model was applied to an analysis o f South Africa’s VAT in 2005.
The National Treasury has initiated an annual modeling workshop with the participation and
support o f the World Bank. In 2005 a consultative workshop applied the framework to assess the
impact o f large events, such as the 2010 Soccer World Cup in South Africa and suggested a more
optimal composition o f the infrastructure spending required. Phase I1 o f the CGE model i s
underway to establish detailed micro-macro links.

Other Bank assessments and support. Financial and economic management were not
specifically targeted by the 1999 CAS. However, in 2003 the World Bank carried out an
Accounting and Auditing Assessment and a Corporate Governance Country Assessment under
the BanWIMF initiative, Reports on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC).48 Another
ROSC module o n data dissemination i s undergoing review; and an assessment on insolvency and
creditor rights has been launched. In 2003, the Bank also completed a Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR), which the authorities found very useful for South Africa’s public
procurement program and disseminated to departments that were engaged in public sector
procurement.
24.

IMF has identified 12 areas and associated standards as useful for the operational work o f the IMF and the W o r l d
Bank. These comprise accounting; auditing; anti-money laundering and countering the financing o f terrorism (added in
November 2002); banking supervision; corporate governance; data dissemination; fiscal transparency; insolvency and
creditor rights; insurance supervision; monetary and financial policy transparency; payments systems; and securities
regulation.

25.
During the period under review, the W o r l d Bank launched the issuance o f South African
Rand (ZAR) bonds as part o f i t s discount notes program offerings to non-core currencies o f
emerging markets and European accession countries4’ W o r l d Bank debt products provide
investors with the reassurance o f a superior credit rating, a wide choice o f products, and strong
secondary market performance for liquid W o r l d Bank benchmark bonds. I t also provides
competitive funding opportunities for the Bank while helping to develop local capital markets.
Issuance o f ZAR bonds also enabled ZAR-denominated lending instruments, which was an
objective o f the 1999 CAS.

Outcome 1.2-Structural reforms and improved sector policies
26.
The 1999 CAS stressed how economic distortions inherited from the apartheid era called
for structural reforms, and how these reforms, although already formulated, were minimally
implemented with some exceptions (e.g., trade liberalization). The CAS envisioned substantial
contribution in this area particularly by helping to develop a credible time-bound commitment to
future trade liberalization, support to the privatization process, and development o f a competition

policy. T h e main analytic studies were on the “sources o f growth” and “spatial dimensions o f
productivity.” Analyzing the Sources of Growth was assessed as satisfactoly by a Q A G ESW
panel in FY02 but was rated as marginally satisfactoly by the Q A G AAA assessment in FY04.
Analyzing constraints to growth and employment. Evidence from the Small, Medium
and M i c r o Enterprise Firm Survey took the form o f technical assistance and in 2002 was praised
by QAG for i t s quality, relevance, and timeliness. However, it was noted that given the
relationship with the South African Government, the opportunities for a sustained policy dialogue
were low, and this output was not likely to contribute in any significant manner to policy or
institutional reform.
27.

Analyzing the investment climate. The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) was a
collaboration among the W o r l d Bank’s Development Economics and Private Sector Development
units, and the South A h c a Department o f Trade and Industry, and local academics. By
benchmarlung investment climate between comparator countries, it links business environment to
firm-level costs and investment disincentives. This analytic work was done in a true partnership
fashion, including joint financing; it adopted a very pragmatic approach indicating actionable
policy changes directly feeding into ASGISA; and used cross-country quantitative comparable
data for benchmarlung.
28.

Outcome 1.3-Labor absorbing growth
29.
The 1999 CAS pointed out that lack o f labor flexibility on wages and conditions were
affecting the employment figures, which were deteriorating instead o f improving. In addition,
foreign direct investment was l o w and curtailing domestic dynamism. The Bank envisioned
collaboration with IFC o n a series o f feasibility studies through the Africa Project Development
Facility. The I F C did not staff i t s small, medium, and micro enterprise (SMME) initiative in
South Africa until the last two years o f the review period so there was l i t t l e opportunity for direct
cooperation prior to that. After creation o f the I F C Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP), Africa,
recruitment o f several SMME development specialists at IFC (Johannesburg office), and transfer
o f a lead PSD specialist in the Bank (Pretoria office), working-level cooperation has been
increasingly close.
30.
Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation Projects’. This project was the only
lending operation at the time o f CAS preparation with the primary objective to support
sustainable economic growth and j o b creation by enhancing the industrial competitiveness o f
South African firms, particularly o f small, medium, and micro enterprises. T o accomplish these
objectives, the project’s strategy was to catalyze use o f technological, marketing, and
productivity-enhancing business development services; support information sharing and foster
networking and partnerships within and among subsectors; reduce bottlenecks associated with
short-term trade financing for SMMEs; and expand the role o f SMMEs in the industrial sector.
The project was an integral part o f the array o f supply-side measures to enhance industrial
competitiveness that the Government had formulated in consultation w i t h potential beneficiaries,
such as the Productivity Improvement Program. The performance indicators were (a) increased
firm competitiveness; (b) increased firm ability to take advantage o f market opportunities; (c)
accelerated j o b creation; (d) increased awareness, interest, and knowledge in exporting; and (e)
strengthening business services.

Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation Project (P048606, May 29, 1997) for US$46 million (US$21 million
was cancelled); US$24 million was fully disbursed.

50

3 1.
Although performance indicators were not clearly established and n o periodic
measurement and feedback to agencies and contractors was done during implementation, the
subcontracted Competitiveness Fund management unit measured the outcome indicators in a
qualitative study. Quantitative and qualitative impact studies started in November 2003 and point
to marginally satisfactory performance by the Competitiveness Fund, a good performance o f the
Black Business Supplier Development Program (BBSDP), but a moderately unsatisfactory
performance by the Sector Partnership Fund (SPF). The Internal Evaluation Group (IEG) rated
the project as moderately satisfactory pointing out that although one project objective (BBSDP)
was substantially achieved; the others were only partially achieved or not achieved. And the
efficiency o f the project was reduced by the apparent over-subsidization o f business development
services. In retrospect, however, the project was modestly successful and took a long time to
implement. The Quality Assurance Group found the project’s supervision work to be satisfactory
showing considerable flexibility in adapting borrower’s wishes to take over project
implementation responsibility from a project implementation unit. Cooperation with the
Department o f Trade and Industry over 7 years o f implementation was good, and a framework for
impact evaluation was developed jointly with the Bank and carried out in 2004-05 o f SMME
programs.

Pillar 2-Social and Environmental Sustainability
32.
The CAS vision. The 1999 CAS highlighted three related themes promoting sustainable
development: (i)reduce the high incidence o f poverty and inequality; (ii)foster more rapid
human resource development across all o f society (particularly traditionally excluded groups);
and (iii)
sustainable utilization o f the national natural heritage. Four outcomes were articulated
around these three themes: (a) reduction o f poverty and inequality, (b) delivery o f social services
and infrastructure, (c) human resources development and better distribution o f assets, and (d)
environmentally sustainable growth. Assessing clear progress and contribution to CAS outcomes
i s challenging given the very vague articulation o f targeted outcomes and n o clear indicators.
Conclusion. There i s evidence o f positive contribution fi-om the W o r l d Bank in the areas
o f local government and municipal finance, land reform, and the environment. The good
partnerships established in the early 1990s have been maintained, and various creative ways for
mobilizing resources were introduced (Cities Alliance, GEF). Despite the fact that the CAS did
not put enough emphasis on the critical role o f local government, the Bank continued to provide
extensive support in this area. At the same time the program fell short o f what i s expected in
critical and priority areas for South Africa-such as human development, service delivery, and
the Bank has a comparative advantage. Only lately,
poverty and inequality reduction-where
through ICA, did the W o r l d Bank make a contribution toward better understanding o f the impact
o f economic and labor policies on formal sector enterprises. A week-long government-wide
workshop o n monitoring and impact evaluation (June 2006) organized jointly with the Presidency
was successful in mapping out a structured and potentially long-term partnership in monitoring
and evaluation for better policy implementation.
33.

51

Outcome 2.1-Reduction of poverty and inequality
The 1999 CAS point o f departure was that poverty and inequality have, since 1994,
consistently been one o f the most acute problems and recurrently o n the political agenda.51 The
Bank’s contribution i s expressed in numerous discussion papers52and poverty-related workshops;
policy notes; collaborative work on determinants o f poverty and inequality; and micro-simulation
modeling household survey data to assess poverty. This work also used census data to map
poverty o n the ground and to monitor i t s status with each budget cycle. Through work done
jointly with Statistics South Africa, the Bank’s main contribution was capacity building.
34.

Outcome 2.2-Delivery

o f social services and infrastructure

35.
Coordination, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation o f social and poverty
programs remain significant challenges in South Africa. The Bank has provided support to
intergovernmental fiscal system design, assessment o f key infrastructure grant mechanisms, and
technical assistance in municipal finance (e.g., municipal bond market, local government pension
funds). In partnership w i t h the South African Local Government Association, the Bank has
worked closely with the South Africa Cities Network in nine city m ~ n i c i p a l i t i e sto~promote
~
propoor city development strategies, urban renewal and informal settlement upgrading, support the
implementation o f the Extended Public Works Program, and to encourage the development o f
urban indicators.
Local governance and municipal pnance. In the early 1990s W o r l d Bank support
focused o n extensive analysis o f infrastructure backlogs in formerly black townships that gave the
A N C government’s RDP a firm stating point for new investment in 1994. The Municipal
Infrastructure Grant (MIG) has evolved into a transparent, predictable poverty targeted subsidy
mechanism which, currently, funnels over US$1 billion to poor communities. In the late 1990s
World Bank support focused on transforming the 900-plus racially based local governments into
284 representative local authorities. This support included plans to design a Restructuring Grant
that has delivered more than US$300 million to larger local governments to fund transformation
costs. Assistance has also been provided to the National Treasury in management o f the emerging
municipal bond market, establishment o f a Municipal Financial Recovery Service, analysis o f
local government pension funds, and strengthening o f National Treasury’s oversight role relative
to municipal Public Private Partnerships.
36.

37.
Municipal Financial Management Technical Assistance Project. The Municipal
Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (MFMTAP), totaling US$15 million, i s the
only active IBRD loan to South Africa. The MFMTAP i s designed to support more than 40
municipalities in implementingthe new budgeting and financial management reforms emanating
from the Municipal Finance Management Act. The MFMTAP supports the Government’s public
finance reform and local government transformation program. Under the Financial Management
Grant (US$150 million) Government has made available resources to support municipalities in
implementing fiscal reform. Other donors, U.S., U.K. and Germany, are also providing grants
amounting to US$9.5 million. At the request o f Government, the M F M T A P closing date has been
extended until June 2008 following the 2005 mid-term review, which rated project

implementation as satisfactory. Implementation continues with international municipal financial
management advisors working with municipalities, a wide ranging policy reform analytical
program, support for internships, and improvements in monitoring o f the intergovernmental fiscal
54
system.
38.
City development strategies. With over 50 percent o f the country’s poor population, the
nine largest cities in South Afkica account for over 60 percent o f the country’s GDP (and, since
South Africa accounts for about 40 percent o f the Sub-Saharan economy, these cities produce
more than 20 percent o f the region’s economy). In recognition o f these facts, significant Cities
Alliance (CA) grant-support has been tapped in a number o f projects listed in TableB2.

Outcome 2.3-Human resources development and better distribution o f assets
40.
While human resource development and better distribution o f assets were rightfully
acknowledged as key imperatives for growth, contribution has been modest in the areas o f health
and education.

Health sector rehabilitation and hospital project. Project preparation for a health
sector rehabilitation and hospital took over 2 years and considerable Bank involvement for a
potential JBRD loan o f US$200 million. A P H R D grant (US$690,000) financed the preparation
plan o f the hospital upgrading, the public-private partnership in health services, and capacity and
s k i l l s development o f provincial and hospital management. Though discussions were carried
parallel with the National Treasury and the Department o f Health, the project was not finalized
seemingly due to lack o f agreement o n h o w the loan would fit the medium-term expenditure
framework and expenditure ceiling for the health sector.
41.

Marginal contribution in the area of education. Results were mixed in the education
sector. An IDF grant o n capacity building for KwaZulu Natal Department o f Education and
Culture (KZNDEC) to implement school district development projects was successful in
improving the s k i l l s o f education managers to develop, plan, implement, and evaluate education
quality enhancing activities at school level. A PHRD grant was used as a tool to engage in
education reform program, meant to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f the national and
provincial education departments and improve equality in educational opportunities. The reform
program’s estimated cost was US$200 million, but the grant letter o f agreement made special
provision for the Government to seek funding not necessarily from IBRD. W h i l e the grant did not
achieve its development objectives (after two extensions it was mandatory to close it) prior to
termination, the Department o f Education and the World Bank team did articulate the scope o f
work, namely the urgent provision o f school inputs. This work i s n o w financed through the
Norwegian Education Trust Fund.

42.

Box B2. South African-World Bank Partnership on Land Reform

54

Contribution to the land reform policy. During the period under review, the partnership
with Ministry for Agriculture and Land Affairs, which started in early 199Os, (see B o x B2) and
was rated as most productive by 2004 Q A G AAA assessment has continued. Highlights included
the review and re-design o f the land redistribution program, and contributed to the formulation o f
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Program. The various areas where the Ministry has
requested Bank assistance have n o w been formalized into a detailed 3-year program o f Technical
Assistance for the Ministry. The program will be funded as so-called “Reimbursable TA” by the
Ministry.
43.

Outcome 2.4-Environmentally sustainable growth
A medium-term priority framework for environmentally sustainable growth. Perhaps
the most positive area o f cooperation between the W o r l d Bank and South Africa has been the
support provided through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The 1999 CAS provided a
broad sustainable development goal and series o f proposed projects that enabled the Bank and
South Africa t o decide how best to grow and solidify the relationship. Endorsed by the South
African Cabinet and other partners in 2001 as well as the GEF secretariat, Bank management,
UNDP, and UNEP, the framework comprised a series o f projects. In particular, the C.A.P.E.
program aimed at assisting South Africa to finance and build capacity to address global
environmental issues while meeting local development needs.

44.

GEFporifolio progress. T h e GEF program’s portfolio has indeed achieved i t s objective
by developing international and national best practice in a number o f areas. A new conservation
method piloted in the Cape Floristic Region focused o n a landscape approach (rather than the
traditional fenced protected areas approach) and involved all land-users promoting a biodiversitybased economy, well-suited for SMMEs (e.g., roiboos tea, wine, citrus, flowers). W i t h Cabinet
endorsement for the program, co-financing targets by Government and other partners are being
significantly exceeded as demonstrated by the recently completed Cape Peninsula Biodiversity
Conservation Project. From this first GEF project which focused o n biodiversity conservation, the
program has grown to include climate change and energy and carbon finance. It has also
expanded focusing on regional environment issues. Table B 3 lists projects in the GEF portfolio,
noting their progress and outcome ratings. South Africa’s authority in the regional and global
environment agenda i s now best recognized through South Africa’s active participation in the
GEF Council, i t s hosting o f the Johannesburg Summit for Sustainable Development (2002), the
World Parks Congress (2003), and the GEF Assembly in 2006. The program has several projects
in the pipeline: 4 in South Africa (CF Durban Landfill Gas to Electricity - Carbon Offset nonGEF; Development, Empowerment, and Conservation in the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park &
Surrounding Region; Methyl Bromide Phase-out; and Renewable Energy Market Transformation)
and 3 regional projects that benefit South Africa (South West Indian Ocean Fisheries; Western
Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development and Coastal and Marine contamination Prevention;
and Groundwater and Drought Management in the Southern Africa Development Community).

South African National Parks Workshop. Prompted by this CAS review, the South
African National Parks (SANParks) carried out i t s own “lessons learnt” workshop in M a y 2006 to
ascertain the value o f the interaction with the W o r l d Bank on the projects under their
management. W h i l e the interaction has not always been smooth (mostly due to bureaucratic
hurdles), in most cases, these projects have performed well. The Cape Peninsula Biodiversity
Conservation Project got a highly satisfactory rating by lEG (see Section IV). Cooperation in this
area spans several South African institutions-SANParks,
Department o f Environment Affairs
and Tourism, Wildlife Fund for Nature, South African National Biodiversity Institute, National
Treasury, DBSA, provincial environment and natural resource management agencies, local
authorities, and communities. Related projects have attracted additional co-funding, both from
Government and private donors. Consistent with efforts to address national and global
environmental priorities by supporting an enabling environment to reverse land degradation and
conserve biological resource, the Government has continued to support the implementation o f
closed projects.

environmental safeguard practices in South Africa concluded that the South African laws and
regulations are broadly equivalent with the Bank’s own policies. The review identified good
practice features o f the South African Environmental Impact Assessment system: (i)
use ofthe
appeal process and existence o f effective appeal institutions and processes, such as the Land
Claim Court; (ii)
use of independent monitoringpanels to monitor the environmental performance
requirement to
and actual implementation o f approved Environmental Management Plans; (iii)
appoint a permanent environmental control ofJicer in case o f large, complex and controversial
projects; (iv) requirement of a stand alone cultural heritage impact assessment report and
issuance o f a separate Record o f Decision by South African Heritage Resources Agency in case
o f projects involving significant cultural heritage impacts; and (v) use o f the Environmental
Management Framework approach at the regional level leading to simplification o f the process
to improve efficiency and focus on effective implementation o f regulations.

Pillar 3-South African Role in Regional Development
48.
The CAS vision. The 1999 CAS recognized the importance o f regional cooperation. The
regional perspective elaborated on the gains from regional cooperation both for South Africa,
which accounts for over three-quarters o f GDP and about two-thirds o f the SADC region’s total
exports, and for i t s neighbors. Thus the 1999 CAS had the objective o f strengthening South
Africa ’s constructive role in regional development through regional investment projects, policy
harmonization, and coordinated external relations. The CAS highlighted potential gains from
regional cooperation for enhancing resource utilization and for growth. Among the projects
envisioned and accomplished included technical assistance work o n private sector finance o f
infrastructure; work on the Maputo Corridor; AAA o n financial sector cooperation; trade and
regional water policy, including strengthening dialogue o n regional issues.

Southern Africa Strutegy. Presented to the Board in April 1998, the Southern African
Strategy pioneered the W o r l d Bank’s emphasis o n regional integration in Africa with focus areas
for support: (a) closer integration o f markets and trade facilitation; (b) regional infrastructure
development; and (c) the liberalization o f labor and capital flows. However, at the time there was
n o clarity about which Bank unit was responsible for moving the strategy forward. A dedicated
regional integration program within the Africa Region was established in 2001 which was
subsequently departmentalized in 2004.

Conclusion. The W o r l d Bank’s contribution to South Africa’s role in regional
development took place through a number o f products and activities. M a n y o f these could be
regarded as successful in their own right, whether designed to build capacity, influence policy
harmonization decisions or create infrastructure for cooperation and development in the region.
Out o f nine IDF grants (Attachment B2) for regional initiatives (during the period under review),
six were implemented by South African institutions, namely DBSA, South African Reserve Bank,
and in cooperation with SADC, thus contributing to capacity strengthening. Since 2001, the Bank
has intensified i t s dialogue with SADC and deepened support in selected areas, in which case
regional activities also benefited South Africa along with other SADC countries. However, the
regional activities with South Africa and SADC institutions did not take place within an agreed,
coherent strategy or framework but were based largely o n specific requests, nor was the response
consistently well-coordinated. The overall portfolio o f regional activities consequently cannot be
considered satisfactory.

Outcome 3.1- Cooperation in infrastructure development
The SADC transport sector. Supported through a Transport Investment Conference, the
SADC transport sector aimed to promote private investment and management in transport
operations. The PPIAF brought specialized experience in private provision o f transport services
and supported the preparation o f conference with the W o r l d Bank, MIGA, and IFC. Through
spatial development initiatives, the W o r l d Bank Group supported the Maputo Development
C~rridor.~’

52.
Supporting cooperation on energy. The Southern Africa Power Pool was designed to
facilitate the development o f an efficient regional power market in the subregion. The World
Bank Power Market Project provided technical assistance for creating a competitive short-term
regional electricity market that would drive down electricity prices in SADC and foster regional
integration. In addition, since 2003, the World Bank Group, through IBRD partial risk
guarantees, has supported the Southern Africa Regional Gas Project consisting o f development o f
the Mozambican gas fields and a central processing facility, as well as building the gas pipeline
from Mozambique to South Africa.

International benchmarking of infrastructure performance. Building o n the studies for
South Africa and Lesotho, the Bank put together the f i r s t systematic, international benchmarking
o f infrastructure performance in Southern Africa Customs U n i o n (SACU) countries using a new
Bank research database (2005), revealing the strengths and weaknesses in infrastructure
performance compared to other counties and suggesting areas for regional intervention.
53.

Outcome 3.2-Harmonization o f sector policies
54.
Communications. The World Bank supported the Africa Connection Project, an Africanled and managed initiative, comprising over 40 member countries and 5 areas for joint action:
rural connectivity, policy and regulatory frameworks, investment finance, information technology
applications, and human resource development. The Bank assisted in preparing a SADC-wide
study o n the telecommunications sector and market. At the request o f the N E P A D Secretariat, the
Bank provided support for harmonization o f telecommunications regulation and rationalization o f
the various sub-regional interconnectivity proposals and projects in Southern and Eastern Africa.
55.
Cooperation on water. Since 1996, the Bank has supported the SADC on management o f
transboundary waters, including formulation o f the “Regional Strategic Action Plan for Integrated
Water Resources Development and Management in the SADC: 1999-2004.” In addition the Bank
has engaged in a multi-country, GEF project “Groundwater & Drought Management” and has
completed studies on the Zambezi River Basin.

56.
Drought Monitoring Center. Support was provided to develop a regional capacity to
ensure early warning o f extreme anomalies in weather patterns and climate in the SADC area,
creating a sub-regional network that links suppliers and users o f seasonal forecasts. The network

IDA-supported First Roads and Coastal Shipping Project in Mozambique included design studies for a toll road;
supported Mozambique’s preparatory efforts for the development corridor; and financed the rehabilitation of feeder
roads into the toll road. The IDA-supported Maputo Corridor Revitalization Project financed assistance to the
Government o f Mozambique and the port and railway company, CFM, for preparation o f the concession process of the
Maputo port and railways. The IFC provided US$120 million in senior and subordinated loans to fund the aluminum
smelter, Mozal.
57

58

has provided training and funded ten pilot projects by institutions (mostly universities) in the
region.
Statistical capacity in SADC. Through a grant for strengthening statistical capacity in
SADC, the second generation live database system was disseminated to national institutions in 6
countries. The project complemented on-going efforts o f the SADC Secretariat in harmonizing
statistics within the region. Subsequently, grant support has been provided for evidence-based
poverty reduction strategies in SADC member states.
57.

58.
Public sector debt management. Collaboration focused o n strengthening capacity
through an online and paper-form learning tool for regional organizations and ministries o f
finance and central banks. By involving regional entities in the work, on-the-ground cooperation
and coordination was ~ t r e n g t h e n e d . ~ ~
59.
Agriculture andfood security. The Bank contributed to a multi-donor food security and
rural development hub to SADC, which assists member countries in rural strategy formulation,
project preparation and implementation, capacity building, and the promotion o f regional
partnerships in rural development. A joint study to mitigate the risks o f food insecurity was
carried out for an Extraordinary Summit o n Food Security in 2004, as well as an Afkican U n i o n
Summit.

Education. An IDF grant was used to strengthen capacity for education policy among
SADC education policymakers, researchers and analysts. T h e Netherlands and the Swedish
International Development Agency supported this work.

60.

61.
H I V / A I D S . The Bank provided technical and logistical support for the SADC
Extraordinary Summit on HIV/AIDS in 2003. Since the Summit, the Bank has engaged in
dialogue with the national A I D S councils, other coordinating bodies and NGOs in the S A C U
countries. A regional Development Marketplace competition for small grants was held in 2004.
The Bank continues to facilitate knowledge sharing among the S A C U national AIDS councils,
NGOs, business coalitions for fighting HIV/AIDS, and development partners through
consultations and a technical assistance. Though funding i s limited, the Bank’s on-time
interventions responding to urgent demands from the countries has been highly appreciated.

62.
Shared marine resources. The Bank, through GEF grants (Southwest Indian Ocean
Fisheries Project and South Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway) i s supporting better
management o f shared marine ecosystems across c0untries2~’. I t i s envisaged that a South African
maritime institution would implement and manage the GEF grants o n behalf o f all recipients.
The GEF project i s part o f the broader ecosystem approach within the SADC.
63.
WBI regional activities. The WBI has helped facilitate the exchange o f knowledge and
experience across African countries through the delivery o f training activities both in South
Africa and across the continent with South Africa participation. The activities helped bring
together policymakers and practitioners from a range o f disciplines to share policy positions and
perspectives. Table B 4 provides a sample o f the types o f activities delivered.

58 Regional cooperation came from the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute o f Eastern and Southern
Africa, Financial and Investment Sector Coordinating Unit o f SADC, South African Debt Office, and African
Development Bank.

Outcome 3.3-Coordination of trade and investment policies
As identified in the CAS, South Africa has 80 percent o f GDP and trade in SADC. Reintegration o f post-apartheid South Africa has led to increased export and investment linkages.
The outcomes sought were the reduction o f regional trade barriers and the harmonization o f
investment incentives.
64.

65.
Strengthening and creating regional pnancial infrastructure. The IDF grants provided
to the South African Reserve Bank complemented the Reserve Bank’s own financial and human
resources devoted to the agenda o f the SADC Committee o f Central Bank Governors. Attachment
B2 l i s t s the regional IDF grants largely implemented by South Afncan institutions. Projects
supported the SADC financial system infrastructure (i.e., the modernization o f payments,
settlement and clearing systems in SADC countries) and a coordinated regional approach to
cross-border payments for trade and investment activities. The project received active support
from the worldwide financial community, including the BIS, IMF, and major central banks.
Today nine SADC countries have successfully completed implementation o f their national real
time gross settlement systems and acquired the capacity for i t s operation. The SADC IT Forum
Project aimed at accelerating the speed and quality o f central bank-sponsored IT initiatives within
the region. A regional financial market integration study by the W o r l d Bank, requested by the
SADC and Committee o f Central Bank Governors’ Secretariats, has identified several broad areas
for further work from a regional perspective.
66.
To strengthen public sector accounting standards, the World Bank i s providing support
with the Eastern and Southern African Association o f Accountants General as implementing
agency. A grant to SADC for harmonization o f accounting and auditing frameworks and
standards for the private sector in the Eastern and Southern Africa region i s implemented through
the Eastern, Central, and Southern African Federation o f Accountants.

60

Trade dialogue. The importance o f trade talks to SADC was evident internally by the
establishment o f the SADC Free Trade Area, which began in 2000; and externally with the
signing o f the EU-South Africa Free Trade Agreement (FTA). T h e W o r l d Bank prepared
analytical reports and shared knowledge o n the economic and fiscal impacts o f the EU-South
Africa Trade and Development Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) and SADC Free Trade Area.

The Bank has also been involved in other trade-related knowledge sharing: (i)
the W o r l d Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database to the Trade and Industrial Policy
Secretariat (TIPS) to improve the quality and accessibility o f data on trade and protection in
Southern Africa; (ii)
analytical work o n standards and trade, with South Africa as one o f six
country case studies in Africa; (iii)
analytical work requested by SADC and SARS in support o f
the SADC Sub-committee on Customs Administration to improve customs administration in

Assessing the World Bank’s Performance

Quality o f products and services
68.
The Q A G assessment o f South Africa’s AAA program (FYO1-04) reviewed a sample o f
tasks individually6’ and assessed through a questionnaire the totality o f the AAA program and the
relationship between the World Bank and South Africa. The questions focused on whether there
was a sustained dialogue with the authorities, whether that dialogue contributed to the design o f
an AAA program, whether the Bank management followed the policy imperatives laid out in the
1999 CAS, whether Bank Management kept the country’s changing circumstances constantly
under review, whether these reviews resulted in AAA updating, and whether findings from
individual tasks were subject o f Bank Senior Management’s dialogue w i t h Government.

69.
QAG assessment. The Q A G panel assigned a rating o f unsatisfactory to the overall South
Africa AAA program for the FY2001-04 period concluding that the W o r l d Bank’s work f e l l
considerably short o f what i s expected from the institution’s role and involvement, particularly
for a country o f South Africa’s significance61. The assessment also concluded that the World
Bank had to take cognizance o f the fact that the stability o f South Africa’s economic, political,
and social future i s critical for the African continent. Putting it into perspective, South Africa has
moved from an economy, society, and polity dominated by a white minority in which the state
played a dominant role to a system in which democracy has brought political power to the black
majority and the market i s the predominant player in the economy. If South Africa succeeds in i t s
remarkable experiment o f transformation, it will have a profound impact on the rest o f the
continent. Conversely, if South Africa stumbles it will drag down with it the rest o f the African

A set o f 8 out o f 16 completed AAA tasks in FY01-04 was assessed individually with a focus on the effectiveness
and quality within the country program context. In addition, the ratings for the ‘Sources of Growth’ study, earlier
assessed as a regular individual task, were revisited. These 8 tasks included not only formal ESW built around
conventional reports, but also more informal written products and process tasks, such as conferences, workshops, and
other knowledge activities.

6o

A rating of unsatisfactory was assigned to the Strategic Relevance and Coherence and Integration dimensions, and a
marginally satisfactory rating to Dialogue and Dissemination and Likely Impact, but Internal Quality received a
satisfacto ry rating. The panel found the Bank Input and Processes to be unsatisfactory.

61

continent.62 Given i t s importance, South Africa deserves a much closer relationship with the
W o r l d Bank than was the case previously.
70.
South Africa’s unique needs. The Q A G assessment also concluded that South Africa has
been an unusual client with needs and demands which are significantly different from other
countries in the region. Relations with the World Bank are managed by a strong National
Treasury (Ministry o f Finance), which has been successful in conducting a macro stabilization
program and imposing fiscal discipline o n the line ministries. Even after the stabilization was
achieved, the National Treasury has been extremely cautious in borrowing and increasing
e ~ p e n d i t u r e s . ~Like
~ all demanding clients, South Africa requires the right set o f skills o n the
part o f the Bank and also the, right approach by Bank managers to understand and address the
complexities involved in a country engaged in fundamental economic, political, and social
transition. Just as the Bank should factor into i t s approach South Africa’s importance for the
African continent, the South African Government and c i v i l society should recognize that the
Bank could contribute to the country’s transition. For this win-win situation to materialize, the
two sides at the senior levels would need to engage in a serious dialogue. This did not happen
during the Q A G review period for FYO1-04, even though in November 2000 a retreat o f the
South African Cabinet was organized with attendance by the Bank President and senior staff.
71.
Program totaling less than sum of its parts. W h i l e a great deal o f good work was done
by the World Bank staff in a number o f areas critical for South Africa’s economic developmentparticularly in land reform, municipal finance, environment, and private sector developmentthe overall AAA program was considered unsatisfactory by the Q A G panel (see Table B5).
Besides being conducted without the benefit o f an agreed policy fiamework or a coherent
strategy, the AAA program received i t s l o w rating for a number o f reasons:
0

Little coherence with the country’s overall development strategy and priorities; not in
accord with the Bank’s own broad objectives in the country as laid out in the 1999 CAS.

e

Individual tasks did not add up to an overall dialogue on the strategy for sustained growth
or poverty alleviation, or for improvements in income distribution or public services.

0

Transaction costs for individual task managers were high since they spent a great deal o f
time in developing their own “practices” without the benefit o f an overall framework.

0

The portfolio o f studies and advice provided was essentially ad hoc and disconnected.

Feedback from senior Bank StafJ Senior Bank staff indicated that it was difficult to
72.
achieve a good outcome in South Africa for several reasons:
0

World Bank efforts to initiate a dialogue with policymakers were rebuffed.

Vivek B. Arora and Athanasios Vamvakidis in “The Implications o f South African Economic Growth for the Rest o f
Africa” (IMF Staff Working Papers, March, 2005) state that “based on data for the period 1960-99, the panel regression
results indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in South African economic growth i s correlated with a %%
percentage point increase in growth in the rest o f Africa. The coefficient remains significant when non-South-African
growth is included in the regression, and it i s larger than that o f non-South-African growth, suggesting that the
influence o f South African growth i s distinct f r o m any common regional shocks that may affect growth across different
African countries and also that it dominates the effect o f any such shocks.”
63 In this regard, South Africa i s not unique. In many countries that went through successful stabilization efforts, the
Ministries of Finance, which gained strength and established fiscal discipline under adjustment programs, have
continued to exercise a conservative fiscal stance.

62

Participation o f the W o r l d Bank's President in a 2000 policy seminar should be seen as an
indication o f the senior managers' earnestness in engaging the South African leaders in a
policy dialogue. There was n o follow-up from the South African side in response to
Bank's effort to move forward.
There was a level o f h s t r a t i o n with work developed with the l i n e ministries by refusal o f
the National Treasury to give the final go ahead.

The Bank continues to struggle in demonstrating i t s relevance to middle-income
countries in general and South Africa in particular; and i t s shortcomings in South Africa
should be viewed from that perspective. South Africa has negative perceptions o f Bank
performance in the rest o f Sub-Saharan Africa posing a serious stumbling block in
building a sound partnership with South African leadership.

73.
CAS diagnosis good. The Q A G assessment concludes that the 1999 CAS contains a good
diagnosis o f the country's situation at that time. The AAA groundwork was laid in the CAS but
was not followed carefully when designing the actual AAA program.

74.
Funding declined. Funding for the South Afiica program declined in the absence o f a
deliberate regional management decision to allocate more resources than the standard formula
(based largely o n project portfolio). Most o f the bilateral trust funds, which were mobilized in the
early days o f the program, became scarce because o f the relatively high-income level o f South
Africa. The level o f AAA spending in South Africa was much lower than in other countries with
populations o f similar size and with similar economic characteristics, such as Thailand. Although
the portfolio consisted o f only two projects with no new projects proposed in the CAS, 54 percent
o f direct program costs (US$5.8 million out o f US$10.8 million) was spent on lending and
supervision during the FYO1-FY04 period. These costs went for approval o f a new project for
municipal financial management in 2002, supervision o f a 1998 industrial competitiveness
project, and a few GEF projects and new project development.

63

Issues going forward. The Q A G panel highlighted three imperative issues that need to
75.
be addressed: (a) h o w to improve the Bank’s reputation that has suffered because o f the way it
conducted itself in the past; (b) h o w to finance economic, sector and advisory work when there i s
not much demand in the country for a large lending program; and (c) h o w to attract staff to work
within the W o r l d Bank with knowledge and experience o f middle-income countries.

Bank’s response to the 2004 QAG Assessment
76.
The 2004 Q A G assessment was completed at the time when there was a change in the
Bank’s regional management team for South Africa, which immediately took action in addressing
the shortcomings and Q A G recommendations. Specifically, during 2005-06 the new regional
management team took the following measures:

Improved dialogue. Initiated regular meetings with South Africa’s leaders, particularly
the Minister o f Finance, and established contacts with various departments o f the
National Treasury and the Presidency. Expanded exchanges with the private sector, civil
society, academia, and the media. Initiated preparation o f flexible partnership strategy.
Focus on priority areas. Initiated new analytic work o n key priority areas, specifically on
economic growth and employment, and improving service delivery, including monitoring
and impact evaluation.

Dissemination of Bankproducts. Launched partnerships to disseminate in South Africa
a l l major Bank reports-World Development Report, Doing Business, Global
Development Finance, Global Economic Prospects-and initiated Development
Information Centers to be opened with partner institutions.
Skills mix. Relocated key members o f the country team to South Africa more than
doubling technical staff. Systematically engaged staff experienced in middle-income
countries, including Development Economics Vice-presidency (DEC) and other Bank
networks.
Enhanced collaboration with IFC/MIGA/FIAS. Collaboration with IFC, MIGA, and
FIAS through developing a joint memorandum o f understanding with the Department o f
Trade and Industry; and sharing o f staff within the W o r l d Bank Group.
Increased Bank budget. The Bank budget was increased by 30 percent in FY05 and 10
percent in FY06, although fi-om a l o w base. A rapid response fund was set up and
managed by the Country Director, and two new reimbursable technical assistance
knowledge programs were prepared.
Increased involvement in regional programs. Involvement increased in regional
programs including the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) and the
WBI Africa-wide knowledge economy conference.
77.
One IBRD loan project (Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation) and one large GEF
grant project (Cape Peninsula) were completed during the period. Both projects were rated as
satisfactory for Bank performance. For achievement o f the project outcome, the Cape Peninsula
project was rated as highly satisfactory, while the Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation
project was rated as moderately satisfactory (Table B6).

Working without a clear strategic framework. Discussions with Government have been
underway for developing a n e w strategy since 2002. However, the processing o f a draft C A S
prepared in FY04 did not go beyond a team review. This means that the Bank has been working
for several years without the reference o f a clear strategic framework.

79.
Knowledge partnership unachieved. The fundamentals o f a “Knowledge Partnership”
are not yet achieved. Despite efforts, staff perceptions are that, apart f r o m some individual
successful partnerships, the knowledge partnership at an institutional level has only started taking
shape in the last couple o f years.
80.
National capacity building falls short. While WBI delivered a large number o f activities,
the capacity building was not fully integrated into a national capacity-building strategy. F r o m
July 2000 through June 2006, over 3,500 South Africans participated in WBI activitiesaveraging about 600 participants per year. During this time frame, 7 8 activities were delivered in
South Africa resulting in more than 50,000 participant-training days. South Africans participated
in 296 regional and global activities outside o f South Africa, which resulted in 4,275 South
African participant-training days. The programs ranged f r o m health sector reform, environmental
management, education, and trade. In recent years the focus has been shifting t o HIV/AIDS,
parliament, city management, and corporate and social responsibility. Programs have also
covered media and distance learning, and electronic knowledge exchange through examples such
as the African Virtual University, and the Schoolnet South Africa program. South Africa was an
important member o f World Links for Development, which assisted secondary schools to
introduce information and communication technologies into collaborative learning. In retrospect,
while important institutional partnerships were developed, the numerous activities did not
translate into a strategic and focused learning program.
81.
Bank relevance in South Africa. The Bank has made great effort at figuring out ways to
become relevant in South Africa and engage the Government in fruitful dialogue. However, there
has been no clarity o f who i s really the “client.” And there i s n o clearly defined donor assistance
role in a middle-income country such as South Africa. And at the same time, South Africa i s also
a donor and wants to be engaged as an equal partner with the Bank and other donors.

The “hassle factor”. The Bank has been rigid in terms o f existing instruments and red
tape. The so-called “hassle factor” o f Bank procedures has often undermined the good intentions
o f developing a knowledge partnership. For instance, the rigidity o f Bank procurement policies
have implications for implementing agent’s obligations and commitments in terms o f the laws o f
South Africa for preferential treatment. The Bank has also failed to consider the resource
requirements for working in South Africa as a knowledge bank, thus limiting the level o f
responsiveness. Some activities that were planned had to be cancelled because the authorities
82.

65

were not prepared for engaging or the ideas were too new (e.g., the carbon fund initiative
proposed to the Cities Council). In the case o f IDF grants, two were cancelled as the transaction
cost and hassle factor were seen as too high by the National Treasury.
83.
Consistently slow disbursement. The lending program has been small, with GEF projects
comprising the bulk. However, disbursement ratios have oscillated between 12 and 37 percent,
with an average 21 percent since FYOO. Table B 7 shows portfolio trends between FY99 and
FY06.

Country dialogue, outreach, and external communication
84.
Dialogue between Bank and client. Effective dialogue between the Bank and the client
was sporadic for several years. Suspicions and preconceived notions s t i l l prevail in some strata o f
the society and Government regarding the Bank’s intentions. The CAS spelled out annual
priority-setting meetings and tri-partite meetings involving Bank, National Treasury, and line
ministries to share views on the development priorities in the country. These meetings never
happened. Over the past two years, there has been a renewed dialogue and interaction at all
levels, as seen through the regular meetings with the Bank’s Africa Region vice president,
country director, other vice presidents, and South Africa’s Minister o f Finance and other senior
officials.
85.
Client suwey. The Client Survey carried out in January 2006 revealed that despite the
l o w familiarity with the W o r l d Bank, there was support for more Bank involvement specifically
in education, service delivery, and employment generation; and in broadening the range o f
stakeholders. Interviewees expressed opinions that the Bank was not playing a relevant role in the
development o f the country and that the Bank should define i t s role and improve i t s effectiveness
using innovative products. W h i l e respondents were convinced that the Bank’s effectiveness to
produce knowledge i s very good, they were less complementary o f h o w the Bank had adapted its
knowledge to South Africa’s need. The findings o f the Client Survey are consistent with those
expressed in the feedback received in putting together this CAS Completion Report.
86.
Increasing external communications. Since 2004, several efforts to improve external
communications have contributed to improving the World Bank’s engagement. There has been
increased exposure through the regional Development Marketplace where small grants have gone
to NGOs for HIV/AIDS projects for South Africa (and Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and
Swaziland). Partnering with various institutions, including the DBSA, the W o r l d Bank has cohosted knowledge events and dialogue forums around key Bank products to further the

66

development debate. I t has worked with the Council o f Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
o n indigenous knowledge sharing; with the SABCOHA o n organizing a meeting o f 14 African
business coalitions against AIDS;64with the Development Information Centers in South Afi-ica to
help share information and enrich the debate; and with c i v i l society to keep an ongoing dialogue
in the broadest sense.
87.
Outreach and dissemination of Bank work. The QAG assessment was critical of
dissemination o f analytic work for the period FYO1-04. Jointly with the Government o f South
Africa and DBSA in the past couple o f years, the Bank has been organizing presentations and
discussions o f research studies and publications to improve i t s record for dissemination in South
Africa. All in all, the recent outreach approach has yielded positive results as demonstrated by the
qualitative and quantitative results o f the Client Survey. In sum, the Bank performance on
outreach and communications until 2003 was poor, with substantial progress made since mid2004 with the full engagement o f the country director in all programs. As a direct result o f this
approach came the first meeting in March 2006 with c i v i l society organizations, regular
roundtables with the private sector, and the Development Information Centers.

88.
Dialogue with other donors low. The Q A G assessment points out that the country
dialogue with other donors had been very low, and the potential for joint collaboration even with
I F C and MIGA had not been exploited enough. All development partners expressed strong desire
to collaborate with the World Bank and complement each others’ efforts in South Africa both at
country and at regional level. At the same time, Government has not played the coordinating role
it i s expected to play in an IBRD country.
89.
Poor internal coordination and high staff turnover. During FY1999-2006, there were
five changes o f country economists, with long periods when the post was vacant. The locally
recruited economist was only active for 18 months. And although the economist for Botswana
and Swaziland successfully filled the gap periods, the lack o f continuity and interruptions in the
macro-economic dialogue i s seen as a major impediment to the smooth implementation o f a
knowledge agenda. One o f the critical handicaps has been lack o f communication and
coordination within the broader country team. Lack o f such interaction was partially the reason
behind the failed preparation o f a new CAS in 2002-2003. Teamwork i s seen as one the most
important areas o f improvement in the next phase o f the relationship.

LESSONS
LEARNED: SOUTH AFRICA COUNTRY PROGRAM

90.
The 1999 CAS introduced a visionary element, the creation o f a knowledge partnership
in a country that was well-suited to the task-a middle-income country with well-developed
institutions having substantial influence over the region. The CAS acknowledged the importance
o f capacity-building efforts and regional focus as a prerequisite for a successful program. The
areas o f engagement corresponded to the country’s priorities. W h i l e there have been pockets o f
success, in retrospect the main weaknesses o f the CAS were i t s lack o f ownership and lack o f
focus i t was essentially ad hoc and disconnected, and often without follow-up.

Ambitious goals, lack of engagement. Given the lack o f pronounced interest by
Government to engage in the CAS preparation, the goals were too ambitious. There was an
earnest effort o n the part o f the World Bank to become relevant to an exceptional client with

needs and demands considerably different from those o f other countries in the region. However, it
seems that the Bank failed to understand the complexities and adjust to the changing realities in
the most developed economy in Africa, where notably economic stabilization was achieved in
record time. The second A N C Government had gained confidence; and while eager to exchange
ideas, it was reluctant to be seen as getting advice from the Bank. The tacit strategy to be open to
respond to any request, proved to be unsuccessful as the 2004 Q A G assessment stated. On the
other hand, demands from government agencies were not coordinated or clearly articulated at
times, further complicating communications. W h i l e the CAS did not spell out a lending program,
until recently there was a push by the Bank for South Africa to borrow despite obvious lack o f
interest from the National Treasury or the need to borrow. A t the same time, the Government had
a challenging agenda in addressing poverty, redistributing income, and bringing previously
disadvantaged groups into mainstream economy by building the necessary skills. However,
interaction between the Government and the Bank around these CAS-identified issues was
sporadic and did not translate into a constructive policy-oriented dialogue. Against such a
background, the CAS was striving to build a knowledge partnership without an obvious partner.
The Q A G assessment also noted that the resources made available by the Bank to promote a
knowledge program were highly insufficient.
92.
Critical conclusions from the CAS. From a thematic point o f view, the Bank had
identified the key challenges. However the linkage between sectors was missing and the concrete
interventions were not always jointly defined with the Government. Some critical conclusions:
0

The CAS appropriately identified poverty alleviation as one o f the major problems facing
South Africa; but despite i t s experience and comparative advantage, the Bank did not
effectively contribute to addressing the issues in the former homeland areas, and the socalled second economy.

0

The Bank should have put more effort to support the process o f service delivery. W h i l e
South Africa has done well in policy development, it has acknowledged slow
implementation and problems with eliminating historical backlogs in service delivery.
Substantive work in this area has been initiated since 2004.

0

Due to the inauspicious relations and sensitivities expressed by the Government, the
Bank has been unable to make an impact on containing the HIV pandemic in the most
affected sub-region, including South Africa. While the CAS identifies HIV as a crucial
development problem, it did not spell out any ideas for dialogue or areas o f potential
involvement.
The Bank could have paid more attention to strengthening South Africa’s constructive
role in the region. There i s a perception that the Bank has not been very successful in
building a long-lasting partnership o n regional integration issues and in particular with
the respective parastatals, namely DBSA, CSIR, and HSRC, which did express strong
interest in working jointly.

Under the CAS, South Africa was to become a priority country for WBI, in line w i t h the
knowledge partnership idea. W h i l e a great number o f workshops, seminars, and training
sessions targeting participants from the region took place, these efforts as with other
knowledge products were not articulated into an overall strategy. Starting F Y 0 7 South
Africa has become a WBI focus country w i t h an agreed demand-driven program focusing
on local government service delivery and social protection. Statistics capacity building,
education and science and technology are also included.

68

0

The overall South Africa program would have benefited from a joint I B R I - I F C strategy
and more interaction within the World Bank Group. Such linkage was not established
until 2005. In 2006 IBRD, IFC, MIGA, and F I A S have been negotiating a joint
memorandum o f understanding on future cooperation between the World Bank Group
and Department o f Trade and Industry, which had made the request.

93.
Key messagesfor better partnership. Several lessons emerge from the implementation of
the 1999 CAS as well as from a number o f informal interviews that the CASCR task team carried
out with Bank staff, government officials, and other stakeholders in the country. Three key

messages were highlighted that can help to achieve a successful new partnership strategy between
the South African Government and the Bank:

1. Keep up regular and candid communication to promote and ensure selective and
clear engagement - maintain a broad dialogue but identify clusters o f work and clear
deliverables, value added, and terms o f engagement. Careful analysis and
understanding o f the political economy i s crucial for the relationship, and for timing
o f constructive interventions. The partners-the W o r l d Bank and the South Afiican
be ready to communicate clearly their demands and
Government-should
expectations. Lack o f communication yielded in lack o f CAS ownership and vague
strategy.
2. Jointly define content and orientation of a strategy-support the national (South
Africa) and regional (SADC) aspects o f partnership and the Bank’s role. There i s
evidence that testifies to good results through joint work: a l l initiatives designed and
conducted in a true partnership fashion have yielded positive results, and have built
trust, which i s imperative to moving forward.
3. Respond to demand in a timely manner-promise what each partner can reasonably
deliver and clarify areas where the World Bank Group has a comparative advantage.
Bureaucratic hurdles have often caused delays in providing timely advice. With
setting up a rapid response fund the Bank has been able to improve o n delivering o n
time.

Recommendations for Moving Forward
94.
Choosing instruments. The choice o f instruments i s key and going forward the Bank
should avoid pushing Bank-driven initiatives; find ways to reduce the “hassle factor”; and explore
new ways o f doing business (e.g., reimbursable technical assistance; donor trust funds).
95.
Gaining trust and respect by building on success. The strategy should focus on
regaining trust by providing demand-driven, good quality, timely analytical work which helps
solve problems and avoids Bank-driven exercises with little value to the client. As the CASCR
highlights, there are several areas where the Bank has had a successful partnership with South
Africa and where tangible progress has been made. These areas include the GEF portfolio, the
municipal finance and land reform work, and some joint analytical studies such as I C A and macro
modeling. The common feature i s that they originated in a demand-driven fashion, were executed
in true partnership with the Government (and other partners); responded to immediate needs, and
tapped into Bank experience.
96.
Work under a regional integration framework. Regional activities with South African
institutions and SADC did not take place within an agreed coherent framework. The World Bank

69

should work with South African institutions and other partners to develop a strategy for building
regional integration o n the successful collaboration and leading role that South Africa i s playing.
Bank staff and Government have consistently underlined the importance o f working w i t h South
Africa through a ‘regional lens’.
Adopt a middle-income country approach to the client. The W o r l d Bank should
acknowledge South Africa as a middle-income country that has substantial impact and influence
on the region. F r o m i t s engagement with South Africa, the Bank can draw lessons on h o w to
adapt i t s work in the growing number o f high-capacity, middle-income countries in terms o f
adjusting IBRD products to the country’s needs and priorities, including Bank decentralization,
and engaging regional “engines o f growth” (like South Africa) to the benefit o f the neighboring
IDA clients. Keeping a l o w but substantive profile, the Bank should establish a good “track
record.” In addition, i t should be clarified who the main “client” i s since past experience shows
h o w demands from line ministries ultimately depend on the National Treasury’s final approval.
Finally, The Bank needs to carefully choose the instruments o f engagement. Going forward the
Bank has to reduce the “hassle factor” and explore new ways o f doing business.
97.

Improve internal team work. In terms o f internal Bank organization and staff
better and increase
appointments,
the team members must work together
coordinatiodcollaboration with IFC, MIGA, and other development partners. The Pretoria
country office should take on the role o f coordinator and facilitator for information on available
instrumentsand expertise.
98.

99.
Adopt a results-based strategy and program implementation. A deliberately vague CAS
has not helped the Bank and the client to set baselines, track implementation, and assess results.
The new strategy needs to contain a sharp results orientation and a clear definition o f monitoring
systems to be used in tracking progress. In view o f the widely adopted results-based approach
and the limited BB resources, the Bank and the Government should establish mechanisms to
monitor and evaluate the Bank programs regularly (preferably o n an annual basis) with all
respective partners to ensure quality, relevance, and timeliness o f products. This mechanism
provides opportunities for adjustment or re-direction, and constructive feedback on issues and
problems.
100.
Future results. Despite limitations and complex relations, the Bank continued i t s
involvement beyond the scope o f the 1999 CAS. The last two years have yielded some good
results. There were indications o f progress and improved trust at the preparation time o f this
CASCR, but it remains to be seen whether the approach and the steps taken will be enough to
make a substantial difference and markedly improve the Bank’s reputation, effectiveness, and
results o n the ground.

ATTACHMENT 3
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

1.
While there has been steady growth in the South African economy, and per capita
incomes are among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, unemployment remains unacceptably
high. South Africa’s gross fixed investment ratio has hovered around a relatively l o w 15
percent over the last decade. Evidence f r o m fast growing middle income countries suggests
that in order to reach a sustainable path o f accelerated growth, the investment ratio should be
sustained at 20 to 25 percent.
2.
Private investment has been growing at a relatively healthy 5.9 percent per year over
the last ten years accounting for 71 percent o f total gross fixed investment in the economy in
2004. This performance reflects sound macroeconomic policies, largely business friendly
government policies and a relatively good investment climate. In addition, many large South
African enterprises have successhlly transformed themselves to global players, benefiting
f r o m the end o f sanctions and the increasing openness o f the trade and foreign exchange
regime. But growth and investment has been far greater in capital intensive industries than in
labor intensive ones, which has resulted in a pace o f j o b creation that cannot keep up with
n e w entrants in the labor markets.

3.
South Africa i s often described as having a dual economy. The “first” economy
includes the larger capital and s k i l l s intensive f i r m s in sectors such as mining,
petrochemicals, manufacturing and banking, and other formal sector firms, whereas the
“second” economy i s mainly informal, subsistence o r survivalist in nature, concentrated in
rural and township areas. One result o f this separation i s an underdeveloped sector o f small,
m i c r o and informal sector enterprises. In many countries this sector i s a major driver o f
economic growth and employment. A w e l l developed SMME sector can also serve as a
buffer to economic shocks and can smooth the impact o f structural changes in the economy
4.
This dual economy i s a direct legacy o f the apartheid system, which restricted
education, skills development, entrepreneurship and access to information for the majority
black population and other disadvantaged groups. By confining large sections o f this
population in the former homelands and townships i t also restricted their access to resources,
infrastructure, markets and other economic networks. This combination o f factors severely
limited opportunities o f disadvantaged groups to earn income other than wages. Forced
relocations often disrupted the growth o f those informal sector networks that had begun to
develop. Another consequence was the limitation o n development o f a network o f
commercial business development service providers, which are an essential requirement for
the development and growth o f small and micro enterprises.

5.
While growth in the “second” economy was severely restricted, the concentration o f
formal enterprises in the “first” economy steadily increased. Recent studies have shown that
despite some trade liberalization during the 1990s this concentration and associated levels o f
protection have continued to apply across a wide range o f industries. The years o f isolation
f r o m the outside w o r l d strengthened protectionism and reduced competition in some large
industries such as steel, banking and retail. High mark-ups over production costs s t i l l apply in
many industries. In addition to limiting the competitiveness and therefore the growth and

83

employment prospects within these industries, industry concentration also crowds out smaller
businesses, and limits opportunities for n e w entrants.

Opportunities and constraints
6.
The recent W o r l d BanWDepartment o f Trade and Industry sponsored Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA) and Micro-enterprise Investment Climate Assessment (MICA)
identified constraints in the investment climate. The top four constraints identified by formal
sector enterprises included:
0

Shortages o f skills in k e y professional and technical areas;
Macroeconomic instability, notably the volatility o f the currency;

0

Burdensome labor regulations; and

0

Crime and security issues.

7.
A different set o f constraints was identified by informal sector enterprises. The most
prominent ones included:
Lack o f access to finance;

High cost o f finance;
Lack o f access to transport; and
Lack o f access to land.

8.
The 2008 W o r l d Bank D o i n g Business Report ranks South Africa 35 out o f 178
countries o n the overall ease o f doing business. South Africa ranks highly in terms o f the
quality o f corporate governance and ease o f getting credit (for the formal sector). Areas
identified with the most r o o m for improvement include trading across borders, labor
regulations, and the enforcement o f contracts.

9.

Foreign investment flows have been modest, varying between around 1.7 and 4.5
percent o f gross fixed capital formation since 2001. Observers report that a significant
perception o f political risk remains in the minds o f foreign investors, despite Government’s
strong performance o n macroeconomic policy and willingness to engage foreign investors in
a constructive dialogue. And as mentioned earlier, inadequate competition i s a growth
inhibiting factor in several k e y sectors.

10.
A constraint and an opportunity for the development o f the S M M E sector i s the
underdevelopment o f the financial services industry’s ability to provide necessary finance.
The trend seen worldwide o f larger commercial banks expanding into the lower end o f the
market has yet to become significant in South Africa. Another constraint revealed by recent
studies i s the m i x e d record o f Government support for the SMME sector. Rapid scaling up o f
support programs over recent years did not always take the lessons o f experience into account
and many potential SMME beneficiaries do not rate very highly the quality o f the services
provided by some o f these programs. M a n y potential beneficiaries are apparently not even
aware o f the services available to help them.

84

11.
Lastly the spatial issues inherited f r o m the apartheid era have made it physically more
difficult to promote the small-large firm linkages and cluster developments that are a
significant driving force for S M M E development in many countries.

Government policies
12.
Government’s successes since 1994 in macroeconomic management and in
consolidating major parts o f the “first” economy have already been noted. Although progress
in stimulating shared growth and employment has been less successful, many positive
measures have been taken and results are already emerging in terms o f new business start
ups. Over the last decade, growth in employment in S M M E s has increased more rapidly than
the SMMEs’ contribution to GDP.
13.
In the mid 1990s, in major sustained attempts to address the key constraints, and
particularly the imbalances o f the “dual” economy, Government created a number o f support
institutions and incentives for S M M E development including the Ntsika Enterprise
Promotion Agency, K h u l a Enterprise Finance, local business service centers (LBSCs) and
manufacturing advice centers (MACs). With the integrated Small Business Development
Strategy o f 2003 these initiatives were fine tuned and modified to employ different
approaches for different segments o f SMMEs. At the same time there was consolidation o f
the number o f agencies, a more bottom-up approach was adopted with the involvement o f
business associations, and the promotion o f entrepreneurship was planned by integrating it
into basic formal and technical education programs. A consolidated Small Enterprise
Development Agency (SEDA) was created to take over Ntsika and the Manufacturers
Advisory Centre.

14.
The performance o f these initiatives has been m i x e d and often limited by lack o f
implementation capacity, inadequate targeting, and underdeveloped research, monitoring o r
evaluation o f the impact o f the programs. An important factor i s that many o f these programs
are implemented at the national level whereas the problems are experienced mainly at the
local level where implementation capacity i s particularly weak. Despite this there have been
some interesting provincial initiatives, for example under the “Blue IQ”
investment program
in Gauteng and with business incubators in other provinces.
15.
Since the early 2000s a set o f policies k n o w n as broad based Black Economic
Empowerment (BEE) has been designed, refined and implemented with the intention o f
addressing the imbalances created by apartheid. Cutting across a l l sectors, BEE i s being
implemented through legislation, regulation, restructuring o f state owned enterprises,
preferential procurement by Government, finance for skills development, incorporation o f
black owned businesses in economic advisory bodies and the creation o f sector and enterprise
based empowerment charters. The BEE codes relating to S M M E s were recently simplified to
promote S M M E development. Progress in the implementation o f BEE i s monitored through
the Department o f Trade and Industry by means o f enterprise level scorecards.

16.
Attempts to address the problem o f industrial concentration and unfair competition
were initiated following the passage o f the Competition A c t o f 1998 which created a
Competition Commission along with a Tribunal and an Appeal Court. Follow-up actions to
improve contestability o f markets in the “first” economy have already been taken, for
example in chemicals, sugar, packaging, alcoholic beverages, furniture retail and banking.

85

Successful actions to block horizontal and vertical mergers have been taken by the
Commission o n anti-competitive grounds. A recent OECD report confirmed that Government
has made important strides in developing i t s competition enforcement processes but
concluded that more attention needs to be focused o n non-merger competition measures and
to competition advocacy. The same report referred to a critical need to strengthen the
capacity o f the professional staff and a need to reinforce relationships between the
competition bodies and the sectoral regulators.
17.
M o s t recently the objectives set out in 2004 to halve poverty and unemployment by
20 14 and several existing policy initiatives have been brought together in an Accelerated
Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA) which targets a sustainable growth rate
o f 6 percent per annum. A S G I S A concentrates o n addressing the binding constraints to
development, most o f which are outlined earlier in this Annex. The thrust o f A S G I S A i s on:
a

Infrastructure development, notably power, transport, water, roads, housing and
schools. Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are also targeted as i s
the building o r upgrading o f ten stadiums in advance o f the 2010 FIFA W o r l d Cup.

a

industrial policy interventions targeting priority sectors, notably business process
outsourcing (BPO) and tourism, chemicals, metals beneficiation, creative industries,
clothing and textiles, durable consumer goods and wood, pulp and paper.

a

Education and skills development including professional skills development for
employees such as engineers and scientists, managers and technicians.

a

Elimination o f the dual economy by bridging the gap between formal and informal
sector enterprises. This will include the use o f public funds for S M M E development
programs and a wide range o f BEE initiatives, partnering with private companies to
leverage the first economy, maximizing opportunities for small businesses to benefit
f r o m the 20 10 W o r l d Cup and monitoring and encouraging BEE sector charters.

a

Improving the regulatory environment for small business, including a review o f the
labor laws, the tax administration and the impact o f local government regulations.

a

Governance and institutional reforms to change the public sector, making i t more
responsive to the priority o f accelerated shared growth.

World Bank Group Assistance
18.
The W o r l d Bank Group has supported the development o f the private sector in South
Africa over the last twelve years, working both with Government and also directly with the
private sector. These interventions have ranged f r o m analytical work to direct project support
and investments. M o s t recently, in 2006, at the Department O f Trade And Industry’s request
a memorandum o f understanding (MOU) was prepared which laid out the basis o f a
streamlined relationship between the Department o f Trade and Industry and the Bank Group
including the W o r l d Bank, IFC, F I A S and MIGA concerning all technical assistance w o r k to
b e done by the WBG with the Department o f Trade and Industry. This M O U has been
adopted by the Department o f Trade and Industry and the WBG as a working document, but
i s s t i l l awaiting formal approval.

19.
The World Bank. From the mid-1990s the Bank supported Government’s S M M E
development initiatives with an Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation Project which
was approved in M a y 1997 and closed in September 2004. Total finds disbursed by the Bank

86

.

under this Project amounted to $24.27 million. Government’s contribution was $6.72 million
and co-financing $19.8 million. The Project included support through the Department o f
Trade and Industry for a Competitiveness Fund, a Sector Partnership Fund and an Export
Finance Guarantee Facility. The export finance component was subsequently cancelled. The
Competitiveness Fund provided support mainly through 50 percent matching grants to small
businesses to support the introduction o f business development know-how and technical
expertise to facilitate and stimulate innovation, growth and improved productivity. This
component also supported the Government’s Black Business Supplier Development Program.
The management o f the Competitiveness Fund was outsourced to private f i r m s which
included international and local specialists. The Sector Partnership Fund focused on
enhancing product quality, developing technical skills and penetrating new markets by means
o f partnerships in sectors such as ICT, agro-food, metals, minerals and automotive products.
The number o f beneficiaries assisted by the Project was as follows:

Competitiveness Fund - 1,066 grants paid out and 261 Business Development
Service Providers involved;
0

Sector Partnership Fund
associations; and

-

870 beneficiary enterprises plus members o f business

Black Business Supplier Development Program
SMMEs o f less than 20 employees

-

241 firms, all o f which were

20.
Also in partnership with the Department o f Trade and Industry the Bank has recently
completed a number o f intensive diagnostic studies including:
An investment climate assessment (ICA) in 2005;
An informal sector investment climate assessment (MICA) in 2006;

0

An evaluation o f several o f the Department o f Trade and Industry’s support programs
for SMME development in 2006; and
A value chain analysis for selected industrial products in 2006-including
cottodgarments, automotive products and construction equipment.

In addition at the request o f the Department o f Trade and Industry in 2006 the Bank
supported the development o f a monitoring and evaluation dashboard for the Department o f
Trade and Industry’s main projects and programs and those o f i t s key agencies. This system
has been approved for implementation by the Department o f Trade and Industry’s Executive
Board.

The Department o f Trade and Industry has also asked the Bank to help in the short
t e r m with the design o f a full monitoring and impact evaluation system for the Department o f
Trade and Industry and i t s agencies and to help design and implement an impact evaluation
system for the recently enacted Black Economic Empowerment codes for SMMEs.
21.

22.
Additional analytical work planned by the Bank for the coming year includes followup analysis o f the 2005/2006 I C A and M I C A data to deepen the knowledge o f (i)
the impact
o f exchange rate volatility on businesses; (ii)
the impact o f labor regulations on employment
and economic activity at the lower end o f the income scale; (iii)determinants o f wage
differentials; (iv) the availability o f s k i l l s and the systems for delivery o f training; and (v) the
impact o f HIVIAIDS on firm level costs and productivity. A follow up I C A has also been
launched and will be completed during 2008.

87

23.
The Bank, in partnership with the IFC, i s supporting p i l o t grassroots business
development initiatives through the Soweto Small Business Executive Council (SSBEC). If
successful, these initiatives could b e extended to other cities, locations and business
associations. They could include support for entrepreneurship and skills development,
promotion o f small-large f i r m s links and improved access to financial services for small
businesses.

24.
The International Finance Corporation. IFC has an active program providing
financial products and advisory services in South Africa. IFC’s has invested over $600
m i l l i o n in South Africa since 1995. I t s investment portfolio amounts to $341 m i l l i o n in South
Africa as o f June 2007. IFC committed $229 m i l l i o n in new investments in South Africa for
F Y 0 7 (not including investments with South African companies outside South Africa). IFC i s
also providing a growing portfolio o f advisory services programs and related support for
smaller businesses.
25.
IFC’s current strategy in South Africa has one basic premise and three prongs. The
premise i s that South Africa has a very well developed financial sector, and that IFC should
not compete for normal, local corporate business. The three prongs are (i)
actively support
South African companies going north and going global; (ii)
provide advice and financing
within South Africa where there are underserved niches in the local market and where IFC
can bring value added that complements local capabilities; and (iii)
provide TA and related
support for small business, with a focus o n the informal sector and education.
Actively support South African companies going north and going global. IFC has
26.
already had considerable success: Sappi to China; B H P B i l l i t o n in Mozal; MTN to Nigeria;
Sabco regionally and S A S O L in Mozambique. Further initiatives are being developed which
include Medicare to Nigeria; Netcare to India; Stanbic regionally and Implats in Madagascar.
A full mapping o f South African corporates i s ongoing to determine where IFC can add real
value.
27.
In the longer term, IFC i s engaging with Telkom and NEPAD o n prospective regional
projects including S A D C electricity distribution, Inga power, EASSy fiber optic cable
network, and Kudu gas. IFC staff have been placed in NEPAD to support implementation o f
the East African fiber optic cable network. IFC has also arranged for many South African
corporates to attend the IFC global South-South investment conference in Mumbai, and has
launched a specific initiative with IFC Beijing office to build sustainable A f r i c a K h i n a
business relationships and investments, including IFC advice and financing
28.
The second prong o f IFC’s South Africa strategy i s to provide advice and financing
within South Africa where there are underserved niches in the local market and where IFC
can bring value added that complements local capabilities. The engagement i s very focused
and examples include:
B l a c k Economic Empowerment Investment. IFC supports major companies with a
firm commitment to ensuring their activities create opportunities for local
communities, especially the poor. IFC direct financing to smaller enterprises has
historically n o t proven to produce the most development impact. Today, IFC’s focus
is: (a) private fund investments addressing the medium sized companies; and (b)
supporting partnerships between large companies and small enterprises owned by
historically disadvantaged groups.

88

In M a y 2007, IFC invested $150 m i l l i o n in South African platinum producer L o n m i n
Plc. Through the extensive advisory services package related to the transaction,
L o n m i n will be able to effectively use most o f IFC funding to help previously
disadvantaged South Africans increase involvement in their operations. With IFC’s
support, L o n m i n aims to create 5,000 jobs over the next three years in the northwest
area o f South Africa. Some 1,000 o f these will be at small and midsize businesses and
black-owned enterprises in and around Lonmin’s operations. The company also plans
to add 20 new black-owned suppliers to those that it currently uses.
In July 2007, IFC and the African Development Bank provided financing o f $280
m i l l i o n to Nedbank to allow it to increase lending to underserved markets in South
Africa and the region for affordable housing development, black economic
empowerment transactions, smaller businesses, large-scale infrastructure and
resource-extraction projects, and the agribusiness sector.

Municipal Finance. IFC brought w o r l d class best practice to the C i t y o f
Johannesburg’s first bond issue, with a partial guarantee and a major advisory
component from IFC’s Treasury-Structured Finance group. This i s n o w rolling out,
with a strong technical assistance component on capacity building to secondary cities
in South Africa, with an investment and advisory package for Buffalo City.
Financial Markets. IFC i s supporting South African financial institutions that can
expand elsewhere in the region or develop n e w lending t o serve lower income clients.
Recent examples include Nedbank and Standard Bank. In FY07, IFC provided
financing to Blue Financial Services to support the growth and development o f this
consumer finance company in Southern Africa. IFC will assess opportunities for
carbon finance for South African SMEs, with IFC client banks acting as financiers
using IFC credit lines o f energy efficiency and clean production to generate credits;
as aggregators and traders o f the credits o n the SME’s behalf; and to provide delivery
guarantees through the trade finance program.
Environmental Sustainability. South Africa’s past history o f poor urban planning
coupled by the relatively high level o f industrialization have resulted in challenges to
the natural environment. IFC has directed i t s efforts o n helping companies and
municipalities improve environmental performance. IFC i s actively marketing i t s
services in this area to South African companies.
29.
The third prong o f IFC’s strategy i s to provide PEP Africa TA and related support
for small business, with a focus on the informal sector and education. M u c h o f the IFC
investment program also incorporates advice and technical assistance particularly where
these enhance the development impact o f an IFC investment such S M E supply chain
development, HIV/AIDS risk mitigation, gender mainstreaming and community development
projects. :
PEP Africa i s collaborating with Capesan Limited and the Capespan Foundation
Trust in support o f the Thandi capacity building and land transformation program,
though the establishment o f a three year business linkages program to make market
opportunities available to black empowered and black-owned fruit producers
supported by a skills and enterprise capacity building program. The program i s
building and expanding o n an existing transformation program: six black h i t farm
projects have been transformed and are n o w producing for exports; 35-40 farms will
be assisted through transformation to export-level, including access to land, finance,

skills development and business training. A gender component will b e integrated into
the program.
IFC launched the first research study o n Access to Finance for women entrepreneurs.
The study, Access t o Finance for Women Entrepreneurs in South Africa: Challenges
and Opportunities, was commissioned by the South Africa Department o f Trade and
Industry and undertaken by IFC’ s Gender Entrepreneurship Market program.
In partnership with South African banks, IFC PEP Africa has launched a
comprehensive program to address M S M E lending, portfolio management, risk
assessment and management, deposit policies, marketing, new product development,
and women in banking. This program i s being linked with a forthcoming IFC
investment.

IFC’s Grassroots Business Initiative (GBI) worked with one enterprise to expand i t s
operations into the rest o f Africa, beginning with Mozambique, Swaziland, and
Uganda. GBI has also assisted Streetwires, a South African group o f poor black
entrepreneurs who create and market contemporary African wire and bead craft art

Foreign Investment Advisory Service. FIAS completed a study in 2005 o n the
Marginal Effective Tax Rates o n investments in k e y sectors o f the economy. In 2006 F I A S
started a related project to document the tax compliance costs for small businesses in South
Africa. B o t h o f these projects were requested by the National Treasury and the South African
Revenue Service. W h i l e earlier studies have shown the compliance burden (time and cost o f
preparing tax returns and related administrative procedures) to be quite heavy, the new F I A S
surveys will identify more precisely which taxes and which procedures are causing the worst
problem for small businesses. The surveys, designed jointly by FIAS, NT, SARS, and
representatives o f the private sector, include a detailed questionnaire filled by professional
accountants and bookkeepers, along with a questionnaire for small business managers and a
separate questionnaire for informal f i r m s about their perceptions o f the tax compliance
burden. T h e final report will provide an analysis o f the empirical survey evidence and
recommendations for improvement to lower the tax compliance burden for small businesses.

31.
In partnership with the Department o f Trade and Industry in 2006 F I A S also
completed a study o f the impact o f Competition L a w and Policy o n the South African
Economy. This w o r k included:

A mapping o f the international competitiveness o f South African Industry;
A categorization o f South African f i r m s in terms o f market structure, prevailing
degree o f competition and competitive pressures;
An assessment o f the degree o f concentration in identified sectors with a focus o n
anti-competitive business practices;

An assessment o f the effectiveness o f the competition authorities in dealing with
concentration;
An assessment o f the extent to which a competition culture has been embraced in
sectors that predominantly consist o f state owned enterprises; and

A focus o n the constraints to implementation o f competition l a w and policy.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. In 2002, MIGA established a regional
office in Johannesburg. In recent years, South Africa has emerged as MIGA’s most important
Category Two investor country (and 8th overall), with South African investors accounting for
about US$200 million o f MIGA’s gross exposure. From i t s Johannesburg office, MIGA has
built, and continues to deepen, strong relationships with South African banks, development
agencies and the Export Credit Insurance Corporation o f South Africa. These bonds create
on-going opportunities to assist in the economic development o f South Africa and throughout
Africa.
33.
The current portfolio o f investments sponsored by South African investors i s diverse,
consisting o f projects in the agribusiness, infrastructure, manufacturing and o i l and gas
sectors in Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Swaziland and Uganda. In terms o f MIGA
guarantees in South Africa, the outstanding portfolio consists o f one project in the financial
sector. The project, financed by a Swiss investor, has outstanding gross and net exposures o f
US$12.3 million. In terms o f technical assistance, MIGA i s working jointly with FIAS to
support the Department o f Trade and Industry in developing a strategy and structure to
promote inward investment to increase FDI flows as part o f South Africa’s growth strategy.
MIGA’s guarantees and TA activities for South Africa or South African companies are listed
in Annex B3).

Future World Bank Group Support
34.
In addition to the above activities already completed, underway or planned, there are
a number o f areas o f comparative advantage that the Bank could bring to bear. The final
selection will be made on annual basis following the coordination process described in the
Country Partnership Strategy. These areas include:
35.
Infrastructure finance. The World Bank Group could work with key infrastructure
enterprises, notably Eskom and Transnet, to develop financing options for the infrastructure
investments incorporated in the Government’s strategy. The aim would be to work on subsovereign financing solutions that would not require Government guarantees or only partial
guarantees.
Infrastructure planning. The World Bank could contribute to the formulation o f
36.
infrastructure platforms for growth, either at the regional level, or around growth poles at the
national level. This would involve multi stakeholder discussions on priorities combined with
developing a realistic financing plan.

37.
Telecommunications regulation. The World Bank could support the reform o f the
regulatory environment for telecommunications facilitating access to best practice advice on
how to develop a regulatory framework supportive o f accelerated growth in key sectors such
as tourism and business process outsourcing. If done quickly, this would also help meet the
requirements for the 2010 World Cup.
38.
Promotion of domestic and foreign direct investment. FIAS and the World Bank
could continue work o n the investment climate, both in terms o f comparative work such as
done under “Doing Business” approach and by expanding on the FIAS regulatory work and
the Bank’s Investment Climate Assessments (ICA and MICA). This work could take place at
the national, provincial and local government levels. MIGA and FIAS could also undertake

91

follow up w o r k after the current program advising the Department o f Trade and Industry o n
i t s investment promotion strategy and structure. Such w o r k might be requested either at the
national (Trade and Investment South Africa) o r provincial o r city level.
39.
Promotion o f competition in manufacturing, banking and retail. The F I A S study
o n the impact o f South Africa’s competition law-policy o n the country’s competitiveness and
investment climate could be followed up by further studies as required in priority sectoral o r
technical areas as w e l l as by institutional support for the Competition Commission and other
agencies involved in implementing competition policy.

40.
Regulatory impact assessment and reductions in r e d tape. The W o r l d Bank could
support the Government in developing a methodology for regulatory impact assessment of
(new) Government policies.
41.
Sector and regional initiatives, cluster development and firm linkages. The
W o r l d B a n k could develop more local level initiatives l i k e the City Alliance Project in
Ekurhuleni. This could involve w o r k with local a n d o r provincial governments, small and
large f i r m s , aiming both at direct impact through delivery, but also at improved market access
and skills development for SMMEs, mainly though demonstration effects and exploitation o f
opportunities for small f i r m s to enter the value chains for both established and new products.
An interesting option would be to w o r k o n more aggressive “scaling down” approaches that
w o u l d stimulate large f i r m s sourcing f r o m and providing training for small f i r m s .
42.
Business development services for SMMEs. The W o r l d Bank could work with
S E D A and other S M M E development agencies to: (i)
do baseline research for key target
help establish monitoring and impact evaluation
areas o f S M M E development activity; (ii)
systems for S E D A and other agency projects and programs; (iii)facilitate access to
worldwide best practice and experience in delivering S M M E services; and (iv) help build
delivery systems, mainly through partnerships with private providers.
43.
Training and skills development for entrepreneurs and workers. The W o r l d Bank
could facilitate partnerships with relevant Sector Education and Training Authorities
(SETAs) and private training centers to match training more closely to existing o r h t u r e j o b
opportunities. In addition, the W o r l d Bank, IFC and the Small Enterprises Development
Agency (SEDA) could support the creation o f business incubators in k e y locations for
business development.

44.
Improved access to finance for SMMEs. IFC and possibly the W o r l d Bank could
facilitate the emergence o f m u c h more aggressive second and third tier banks with a specific
S M M E focus. M o s t likely this could be done by bringing in experienced partners to team up
with emerging smaller South African banks. This would w o r k from two sides, as the
increased competition resulting f r o m this approach could increase the appetite o f the large
banks to enter this line o f business more aggressively.
45.
Institutional support for the Department o f Trade and Industry and i t s agencies.
The W o r l d Bank could continue i t s on-going relationship with the Department o f Trade and
Industry in supporting the Department o f Trade and Industry’s research and program
development agenda and especially to help the Department o f Trade and Industry and i t s
agencies set up best practice implementation mechanisms and monitoring and impact

92

evaluation systems for its programs. One area o f particular interest already requested by
Department o f Trade and Industry i s help from the Bank in assessing the impact o f BEE and
setting up an M&E system for BEE. Building on the experience with the Black Business
Supplier Development Program the World Bank could also assist the Department o f Trade
and Industry in a review o f existing programs with a view to making them more supportive o f
BEE objectives.
