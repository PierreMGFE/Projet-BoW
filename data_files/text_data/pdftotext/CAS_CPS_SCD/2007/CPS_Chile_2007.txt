EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Chile has recovered from the economic slowdown o f 1998-2003. By 2004, two years
into the last World Bank CAS, it had reestablished the robust economic growth which
since 1990 has helped double per capita GDP and cut poverty by more than half. High
copper prices have contributed significantly to the recovery. At the foundation o f Chile’s
present recovery, however, as well as o f i t s sustained record o f performance over nearly
two decades, i s the country’s determined commitment to prudent economic management,
sound, consensual governance, and proactive social investments.
Chile has a new Government which i s building on the hard-won achievements secured
since the return o f democracy in 1990, and i s articulating a new vision o f greater social
equity to prepare for the challenges ahead. The Bachelet administration i s pursuing a
coherent development program built around the theme o f equality o f opportunity. The
program aims to accelerate growth, expand global commercial linkages, improve
education, safeguard natural resources, and strengthen competitiveness while addressing
acute and longstanding social problems.
The objective o f the IBRD-IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) i s to support this
program, and in particular to help realize Chile’s goal o f convergence with OECD
income levels and living standards through faster growth and greater equality o f
opportunity. The CPS has been developed to meet the changing needs o f a highly
successful, globally integrated middle income country (MIC) committed to both growth
and social equity. As such, it presents the Bank Group with the complex set o f
challenges that confront, and will continue to confront, many o f i t s M I C clients.

The CPS i s the product o f constructive collaboration with the authorities. Productive
dialogue has yielded agreement on a select number o f projects and a rich menu o f
planned and potential analytical engagement. Areas where the authorities have either
asked for, or have indicated they may seek, Bank support include innovation,
infrastructure and public services, public sector management, the environment, education
and social protection. Engagement has also led to a mutual interest in structuring an
innovative way o f doing business centered on client demand for just-in-time knowledge
services.
The business case for continued engagement with Chile i s compelling, and begins with
development needs. Despite substantial improvements in living standards and a GNI per
capita o f US$5,870 at end-2005, some 15 percent o f Chileans live below the poverty line,
with many millions precariously just above it. Indeed, annual income for most Chileans
remains very low. The distribution o f income i s among the most unequal o f any country
in the world, and upward social mobility i s scarce. Chile has invested proactively in
social protection programs, but the middle class as well as the poor remain highly
vulnerable to shocks. Notwithstanding a significant improvement over 20 years,
infrastructure and public services s t i l l remain outside the reach many Chileans.

1

The second element o f the business case in Chile is client demand. The Government is
not reliant on external financing and has expressed i t s intention to keep borrowing from
IBRD modest. At the same time, the authorities want continued engagement with the
Bank-beginning with expanded access to Bank analytical products. The fee-for-service
joint studies program-designed to take place within a cost-sharing framework-will add
a new dimension to the fast and flexible response. There i s also clear interest for the
Bank to “un-bundle” i t s project preparation and monitoring and evaluation capacity for
use in Government-financed programs. The third basis on which to move forward with
Chile i s to improve the Bank’s ability to respond to the changing requests o f middle
income countries. The fourth and final reason for deeper and broader engagement with
Chile-and Chile’s other development partners-is for the opportunities i t presents for
knowledge sharing with Bank clients beyond Chile.
W h i l e Chile’s demand for IBRD financial support has declined in recent years, i t s
requests for IFC’s services, in targeted value-added areas, have grown, doubling during
the 2002-2006 CAS period, and are increasingly targeted to areas with high social
impact, such as infrastructure, tertiary education and low-income housing. This
represents an important change in Chile and provides the opportunity for the Bank Group
to deliver a truly integrated package o f services to one o f the L C R region’s most dynamic
and globally integrated economies. The CPS establishes the groundwork for effective
coordination in relevant areas where the I F C and IBRD strategic priorities overlap.

The CPS covers four years FY2007-FY2010, lasting through the present administration,
and envisages an indicative lending program o f up to US$250 million. Initial areas
identified include innovation, public sector management and infrastructure. I t i s unlikely
that the authorities would exceed this amount. However, given Chile’s investment grade
status and strong performance, were the Government to request it, the Bank would have
the flexibility to increase the lending envelope significantly during the course o f the CPS.
As a partnership strategy, the CPS i s the product o f outreach and consultation. First, the
Bank Group has engaged substantially with the Government. Second, the Bank and the
I F C have participated in dialogue with government officials and stakeholders on Chile’s
key development challenges. This has been especially true with respect to the Bank’s
participation in Presidential Commissions in such areas as pension reform, education, and
early childhood development, as well as with interactions with the National Innovation
Council where the Bank participated alongside a broad array o f citizens and stakeholders.
Third, Bank staff, led by the country director, travel to Chile regularly to meet with local
Government officials and civil society. Fourth, the Bank conducted a client survey.
Executive Directors may wish to discuss, among others, the following issue:

1) Chile, like other MICs, faces complex challenges and looks to many different sources
o f advice and support. The CPS proposes assistance based primarily on fast and flexible
knowledge services which will be defined as a result o f substantive dialogue with the
authorities and stakeholders. Lending i s l e f t undefined in the outer years to maintain
flexibility. I s the balance between specificity and flexibility in the CPS appropriate?

I.INTRODUCTION

1.
The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Chile was presented
to the Board in early 2002. At that time, the economy was s t i l l recovering from a
slowdown in growth precipitated in part by the global financial crises o f the late 1990s.
The 2002 CAS was successful in strengthening the Bank’s working relationship with the
Government as i t pursued proactive, counter-cyclical investments in health, education
and social protection.
Five years later, Chile i s looking to the future. Skillful economic management,
2.
high commodity prices, strategic public investment in human development, propitious
global economic conditions, effective public institutions, and stable and consensual
governance since the return to democracy in 1990 have enabled Chile to reestablish
strong growth and restore progress in key social sectors. Chile today i s well positioned
to advance i t s ambitious development agenda, including i t s goal o f convergence with
OECD income levels and living standards.
3.
Michelle Bachelet, who in March 2006 was inaugurated as Chile’s first woman
president, has recommitted Chile to this agenda, and, in particular, to the goal o f “Growth
with Equality o f Opportunity”. This bold theme-the slogan o f her successful campaign
and now the title o f her administration’s governing program-reflects
a growing
consensus within Chile that the gains that were to be w o n from earlier reforms have been
secured, and that a commensurate advance in the years to come will require a national
effort to address longstanding challenges. The sound economic management and trade
openness that have defined Chile’s policy framework remain central to the new strategy,
as do efforts to improve competitiveness through increased innovation.

4.
The social agenda i s equally clear, and in this context the administration has been
moving forward o n three priorities. First, to build a more inclusive Chile, starting with
strengthening the pension system and other social protection programs, and improving
access to infrastructure and public services in a l l parts o f the country. Second, to
improve the quality o f education available to Chilean students. And third, to confront
the stark inequalities that restrain Chile’s future growth and development. The IBRDI F C CPS has been developed to support the Government’s agenda in this regard.
Background to the CPS

5.
The CPS covers the period July 2006 to end-June 2010 (World Bank fiscal years
2007-2010). The strategy presents a new business model, but i s based o n a strong track
record o f success. Box 1 on the following page describes the Bank’s engagement with
the Chilean authorities during the CAS period 2002-2006 and before. The Bank and the
authorities have over the past 15 years developed a productive and effective partnership
which has allowed the Bank to contribute to some o f Chile’s most important public
initiatives. This engagement has in-turn provided useful experience and best practice
lessons for Bank support beyond Chile.

3

Box 1: World Bank-Chile Engagement: Building on Success
Chile Solidario i s an innovative package o f legislative and administrative reforms that significantly
improved the p o l i c y framework for poverty reduction and social protection. The reforms have extended
the coverage and effectiveness o f social protection, and have contributed to poverty reduction. The
Bank supported the Chile Solidario initiative in 2003 with a Social Protection S A L for US$200 mn. and
a Social Protection Technical Assistance Loan in the amount o f US$10.7 mn.
Chile Calijica i s a lifelong learning initiative with a special focus o n working adults who need
additional skills that would enable them to find jobs and advance in the labor force. The B a n k has
supported Chile CaliJica since i t s inception in 2002. The principal vehicle for Bank support has been a
loan in the amount o f US$75.75 mn. in support o f a Lifelong Learning and Training Project.
Higher Education. The Bank has been actively engaged in supporting the Chilean higher education
reform agenda since 1999. The Higher Education Improvement Project (1999-2005) helped introduce
quality assurance in tertiary programs and established a competitive fund for quality improvement. To
help continue this progress, the Bank i s n o w supporting the first phase o f the Tertiary Education
Finance for Results Program, which pilots multi-year performance agreements negotiated between the
Ministry o f Education and participating universities.
Integrated State Financial Management System (SIGFE). The program supports more effective
budget processes and controls. SIGFE has been adopted by some 350 out o f a total o f 389 public sector
agencies including 192 hospitals. The Bank supported SIGFE in 2002 with a loan o f US$23.2 mn. Also
in public sector management, the Bank carried out an impact assessment o f the country’s flagship
evaluation system for enhancement o f the quality o f public expenditure. A SIGFE I1project i s planned.
Transantiago, an urban transport plan designed to improve the transport system, aims to reduce
congestion and pollution and increase safety. The Bank supported TRANSANTIAGO with a US$30 mn.
D P L and a technical assistance loan to support implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Related
environmental issues are also being supported with a GEF grant.
Millennium Science Initiative i s helping streamline financial support t o the scientific community. The
project is improving productivity o f top researchers and increasing the number o f scientists necessary
for a competitive knowledge-based economy. The Bank supported the project in 1999 through a LIL,
w h i c h was followed by an A P L to Improve the Innovation System (2003-2007), which i s also funding
innovative multi-sectoral research consortia. A project o n innovation and competitiveness i s planned.
Rural Infrastructure for Territorial Development i s a program to prepare territorial development plans
in 75 territories through a highly participatory, locally based effort that complements current Ministry
o f Planning and Cooperation (MIDEPLAN) priorities for infrastructure in rural communities.
Environmental Management. The Bank has provided broad support to Chile f r o m analysis o f options
for the next generation o f environmental institutions and policies, t o finding by the GEF, Montreal
Protocol, and Carbon markets for land degradation, biodiversity conservation, renewable energy
(including three mini-hydro projects in Chacabuquito, Quilleco and Homitos), climate change
mitigation, and implementation o f the Montreal Protocol o n ozone depleting substances.
Analytical Agenda:

During the 2002 CAS, the Government demand for Bank AAA far exceeded the amount originally
envisaged. W o r k supported the Government’s S M E agenda, territorial development, household risk
protection, and managing contingent liabilities. K e y products included a poverty assessment, a gender
assessment, and a financial sector assessment. Chile has also featured prominently in recent LCR
flagships; including: From Natural Resources to the Knowledge Economy: Trade and Job Quality
(2002); Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History (2003), and Closing the Gap in Education
and Technology (2003).
A FY03-04 QAG assessment rated the AAA program as highly satisfactory in terms o f i t s strategic
relevance and l i k e l y impact. The program was characterized by close engagement with the client and
high client satisfaction. I t also noted that some o f the tasks were noteworthy for the innovative nature
o f their conceptual framework, for policy design and program implementation.

4

6.
The Bank and the Bachelet Government have continued to build on this dynamic,
productive engagement. Substantive discussions began with the Bachelet team before it
took office, and was supported by a series o f Policy Notes (No. 36583-CL). This was
followed by a Development Policy Review (No. 33501-CL). In October 2006, the Bank
and key Government officials, including ministers, held a day-long seminar in Santiago
to discuss the strategic framework o f the Bank’s program o f support. This engagement
has provided the Bank with a rich understanding o f Chile’s ambitious development
vision. I t also has allowed for a pragmatic assessment o f where the authorities are
looking to the Bank for deeper dialogue and possible hture support (see B o x 2).
Box 2: Key Areas o f Engagement with the New Government
Presidential Commissions and Reform Initiatives:
Pension Reform: The Bank has contributed actively to President Bachelet’s Council for Pension System
Reform. The Bank responded to Government requests with presentations o f i t s recent work o n pensions in
Chile, including a chapter in the DPR, and a policy note. T w o months after the Government took office,
the B a n k participated in an international seminar and workshop in Santiago, which brought together global
best practice. The Bank has subsequently remained engaged.
Quality Assurance in Education: Following the student protests in M a y 2006, the Government launched a
major review o f the educational system. A m o n g the policy proposals were a reform o f the financing
mechanism, student selection rules for schools, and the creation o f a Superintendence o f Education to
ensure quality and standards. The Bank has been engaged in this process, chiefly as a facilitator o f ideas
and best practice, bringing together world class experts and practitioners with experience o n the challenges
Chile faces and ideas o n h o w t o apply reforms to Chile’s specific social and political factors.
Infancy Commission: President Bachelet announced a n e w system o f social protection designed t o reduce
the inequalities among the nation’s children. The Bank contributed to the Council’s w o r k with international
experience o n programs targeted t o children between birth and three years, the participation o f women in
the workforce and o n the institutional development and financing o f policies developed to help infants.
Innovation: In May, President Bachelet launched the National Council o f Innovation for Competitiveness.
The Government and the Bank are moving forward with the development o f a project o n Innovation and
Competitiveness. K e y areas include enhancing the Ministry o f Economy to formulate and implement
innovation policies, strengthening o f C O W 0 and CONICYT, the key agencies responsible for executing
government policies in innovation, and supporting Innova Chile under the Government’s Economic
Development Agency (CORFO) t o promote innovative business and technology transfer.
Other Areas of Engagement:
Financial Sector: Follow-up to the FSAP with grant funding f r o m the Financial Sector R e f o r m and
Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) to support the shift to risk-based supervision in pensions, securities, and
insurance. The f i r s t report was delivered in November 2006.
Public Sector Management: Follow-up to SIGFE Public Expenditure Management Project (2002). K e y
areas include improving financial information at the national level, strengthening M&E mechanisms, and
supporting financial administration at the municipal level. Collaboration i s underway to develop a n impact
evaluation o f Chile’s Management Enhancement Program and advisory services o n the management o f i t s
public financial assets. These studies are being carried out o n a fee-for-service basis. In the area o f
regional development, the Bank i s following up the j o i n t w o r k under the last C A S o n developing Chile’s
Extreme Zones with an initiative to produce a pilot development strategy for Chile’s Region Iand XV.
Infrastructure Regulation (TAL): The authorities are committed to continued improvement in the use o f
public resources, increased efficiency in leveraging private sector participation, and strengthening
regulation. The Government has initiated an institutional strengthening program, and has asked for B a n k
support with TA. The Bank has been working closely with the Ministries o f Finance and Public Works.

5

T h e Role o f the IFC

7.
The IFC has provided support to advance the Government’s development
objectives in growth and competitiveness, and has placed greatest emphasis on projects in
which IFC’s involvement would have a powerful demonstration effect in sectors
identified as high priority by the Government, including, increasingly, energy. In recent
years, IFC’s interventions have focused on high impact areas, including infrastructure,
tertiary education and specialized financial market activity including support for SMEs
through factoring and low-income housing finance. From FY02 through FY06, I F C
committed US$371 million, including US$148 million for syndications through the Bloan program. The commitments financed nine projects in five diverse sectors spanning
education, finance, information, transportation and utilities. As o f end-February, 2007,
IFC’s committed portfolio for Chile stood at US$257 million (including syndications),
about twice the level at the beginning o f the 2002 CAS period.
8.
A key feature o f IFC’s intervention has been to focus o n areas o f high impact
characterized by a lack o f competitive long-term financing and which can play a
demonstration role to facilitate access to finance for these areas. A reflection o f IFC’s
success in doing this i s a fairly rapid turnover o f i t s portfolio, e.g. in large infrastructure
project finance that commercial banks are now more actively financing.
9.
Going forward, the I F C will continue to focus on areas where i t brings significant
additionality in line with the country’s goal o f Growth with Equality o f Opportunity with
a special initiative over the CPS period to support the Government 2010 target with
respect to increasing energy supply and, more specifically, renewable energy.

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT
Economic Developments

10.
Chile has been the fastest
growing economy in Latin America,
with an average annual per capita
growth rate o f 4.1 percent over the
fifteen years following the return o f
democracy in 1990.
Per capita
incomes have doubled in real terms,
and the relative income gap between
Chile
and high-income
OECD
countries has also been substantially
reduced. In other words, Chile has

As an open economy, Chile was hit hard by the economic and financial crises o f
the late 1990s. Growth between 1998 and 2003 decreased to an average o f only 1.3
percent per year. This slowdown revealed important external vulnerabilities and some
pressing internal rigidities and shortcomings in productivity.
12.
Chile has recovered strongly over the past four years, with growth accelerating
from 2-3 percent in 2002 to around 6 percent in each o f 2004 and 2005. High copper
prices and strengthening internal demand have played a part. Growth f e l l back to 4
percent in 2006. This i s partly attributable to transitory factors, namely higher o i l prices
and one-off shocks in the copper mining sector (accidents and strikes) and the non-copper
trade effects o f an appreciating peso. The macroeconomic policy framework also has
dampened the growth response to the copper price boom more than in the past: the
Government has run large fiscal surpluses and monetary policy has been tight-interest
rates have risen from 1.75 percent to 5.25 percent over the past two years. The growth
deceleration i s possibly also due to the natural slowing associated with an economy
exhausting the gains from earlier reforms.
13.
Chile has consolidated macroeconomic stability in part through the adoption o f a
floating exchange rate regime and full-fledged inflation-targeting. Similarly, the
development o f a sound regulatory and supervisory framework for financial markets has
reduced the vulnerability o f the financial sector. Most important has been a carefully
calibrated fiscal policy, which has balanced an expanding program o f countercyclical
investments in social programs with an unquestioned commitment to fiscal discipline.
This approach has been backed by the credibility o f a fiscal r u l e (see below).

14.
The country’s financial system i s large and well-diversified relative to i t s regional
comparators, and the system i s viewed as resilient to shocks, with a sound regulatory and
supervisory framework.’ Stress tests carried out as part o f the recent Financial Sector
7

Assessment Program (2004) indicate that the banking system could absorb sizeable
macroeconomic shocks with only moderate impacts on banks’ solvency.
15.
Fiscal Policy. Fiscal perfonnance in Chile has been strong since the late 1980s,
with an average overall fiscal surplus o f about 2 percent o f GDP per annum prior to the
slowdown in 1999. The structural fiscal balance r u l e adopted in 2000 further
strengthened fiscal policy by signaling the intent o f the Government to maintain a
structural fiscal surplus equivalent to 1 percent o f GDP on average over a medium term
horizon. The results, thanks in part to high copper prices, have been impressive. The
Central Government balance was 4.7 percent o f GDP in 2005, i t s highest since 1997 and
well above the budgeted amount.
In 2006, the overall surplus again increased well
above expectations, and i s estimated to have ended the year at 7.9 percent o f GDP.
Revenues were higher than assumed in the budget, and are estimated to have reached
about 25 percent o f GDP in 2006, with expenditures at about 15 percent o f GDP. The
fiscal r u l e has been complemented in 2006 by the passing o f the fiscal responsibility law,
which details how the surpluses should be invested and managed (see B o x 3).
Box 3: Chile’s Copper Windfall
Since 2003, copper prices have quadrupled, increasing f r o m US$O.8 a pound o n average in 2003 t o about
US$3.4 in April 2007. The rise in copper prices has been due to strong world demand (in particular f r o m
China and other East Asian countries), l o w inventories, constraints o n capacity expansion and an increase
in speculative activity. The world’s largest copper producer, Chile has a n exceptionally high export share
o f primary commodities, with copper accounting for 57 percent o f merchandise exports in 2006 and 23
percent o f GDP. The state-owned copper company, Codelco, supplies over a fifth o f the world’s copper.
Direct gains for the central government f r o m the copper price rise have been substantial, resulting in an
estimated fiscal surplus in 2006 o f 7.9 percent o f GDP.
Managing the exceptional proceeds f r o m the copper windfall has necessitated a refinement o f the fiscal
rule. In September 2006, President Bachelet promulgated the fiscal responsibility l a w to bring increased
transparency to the destination o f the copper proceeds, which are to be invested as follows:
Establishment o f a Pension Reserve Fund (Fondo de Resewa de Pensiones, FRP), into which the
Government will place fiscal surpluses o f at least 0.2 percent and at most 0.5 percent o f G D P per
annum. The fund i s to be used f r o m 2016 onwards to meet rising pension commitments, specifically to
guarantee the future payment o f minimum and assistance pensions.
Re-capitalization o f the Banco Central de Chile f r o m the remaining fiscal surplus resources, with a
transfer equal to a maximum o f 0.5 percent o f G D P per annum f r o m any resources remaining once the
contributed t o the Pension Reserve Fund has been deducted. This i s to be undertaken for the next five
years.
Establishment o f a Social and Economic Stabilization Fund (Fondo de Estabilizacidn Econdmica y
Social, FEES) to replace the Copper Stabilization Fund. All fiscal surplus resources in excess o f 1
percent o f G D P will go into the FEES. During periods o f adverse terms o f trade shocks, the resources
o f the FEES will be available to maintain fiscal spending.

16.
The fiscal risks arising from Chile’s contingent liabilities-deposit guarantees,
public concessions, and the minimum pension guarantee-are
manageable. The

8

Government’s debt position i s very strong compared to most OECD developing
countries. Fiscal surpluses have been used to reduce public debt to the extent that the
central government has become a net creditor, with debt claims equivalent to 7 percent o f
GDP at end-2006.
17. Global economic developments since 2003 have been exceptionally favorable for
Chile. The U.S. and Asia, Chile’s main trading partners, have expanded solidly, driving
continued growth in commodity prices, particularly copper.
External financing
conditions have been highly advantageous for emerging markets in general and Chile in
particular. Chile’s strong economic performance and continued favorable global
conditions are reflected in i t s investment grade bond rating. The country has been rated
“A” by S&P and Fitch since 2004 and 2005 respectively, and in July 2006 received an
upgrading from “Baal” to “A2” from Moody’s, bringing it to the levels o f new EU
members such as Poland and Slovak Republic.’ There are increasing indications from the
financial markets o f a firther differentiation o f Chile’s level o f risk from that o f the rest
o f the region.
Social Developments

18.
Since 1990, poverty has been cut by more than half, from 40 percent to a level in
2006 estimated to be between 15-18 percent. Still, some 2.5 million Chileans remain
poor. Looking at poverty in relative income terms (a measure commonly used in
Europe), poverty in Chile appears to be even more problematic: some 30 percent o f
Chileans live below 60 percent o f the median income; this is roughly twice the EU
average. Moreover, millions o f Chileans survive precariously just above the poverty
line, highly vulnerable to income or health shocks. Indeed, not counting the top income
decile, per capita GDP in Chile i s a l i t t l e over US$1,750, or less than U S $ l 5 0 per
month-US$5 per day.
19.
Chile continues to struggle with high inequality. The average income o f the
richest 20 percent o f Chileans was more than 14 times that o f the poorest 20 percent o f
the population in 2003. And inequality i s not just sharp, but sticky, with the shape o f the
income distribution having changed little over the past 15 years. Just as important as the
large differences in income between the poorest and the richest Chileans i s the relatively
small distance between the lowest and the middle income earners. At the bottom o f the
income distribution, large numbers o f people regularly move in and out o f poverty, while
at the top mobility is scarce, as income concentration becomes a barrier between the elite
and the rest o f the population. However, social expenditures go a long way toward
tackling inequity in Chile: if income from social expenditure and direct transfers i s taken
into account (rather than income derived solely from capital or labor) the ratio o f total
income o f the richest 20 percent to the poorest 20 percent falls to 7.6.2

Political Developments

20.
In March 1990, following 17 years o f military rule, Chile reestablished
democratic governance with the inauguration o f President Patricio Aylwin. The first o f
four successive presidents o f the center-left coalition o f parties known as Concertacibn
(including President Bachelet), President Aylwin's administration ushered in a
remarkable period o f cooperative, competent government, economic growth and poverty
reduction (see Figure 4). Concertacidn has played a crucial role in Chile's transition to
democracy through its effective handling o f sensitive political and human rights issues
and i t s highly consensual approach to economic management, which has yielded political
stability and respect for the legitimacy o f government institutions.

21.
In early 2005, the Government and the opposition agreed on a set o f major
constitutional reforms that had been under discussion since the early 1990s. The
presidential term was shortened from six years to four, starting in 2006, to ensure the
coincidence o f presidential and congressional elections. I t also prohibited the immediate
re-election o f a president. This means that President Bachelet came to office with a
smaller window o f opportunity than her Concertacibn predecessors to carry out her
ambitious agenda. The first year o f the Bachelet administration has demonstrated that it
recognizes that there i s little time to lose. The Government launched Presidential and
other high-level commissions (the Bank was asked to contribute to a number o f these) on
a range o f priority issues, including pension reform, innovation, childhood development,
and education, and i s moving ahead with legislation.

22.

The new Government has been tested by several domestic challenges, with many
elements o f Chilean society eager for it to deliver o n the promise o f a more equitable
nation. This is often manifested by calls to invest more o f the copper windfall in key
social services. In M a y 2006, approximately 800,000 secondary school students took to
the streets to demand better education. In August, miners at the privately owned
Escondida copper mine struck to demand a wage increase. In September, teachers and
health workers threatened to strike for pay hikes. Early 2007 has presented i t s own
obstacles: student leaders throughout the country have threatened to resume protests and
strikes to signal dissatisfaction with the Government's first year in office, the roll-out o f
the Transantiago urban transport system was met with protests and threats o f a general
strike by transit workers, and President Bachelet was compelled to carry out a major
shake-up o f her cabinet.

11

23.
Beyond wage pressures, however, social unrest, and the student strikes in
particular, reflect emerging strains as Chile continues to develop. Students from
socioeconomic classes that traditionally did not seek admission to the country’s elite
universities increasingly expect to have the same educational opportunities as those from
high-income or well-connected households; university graduates expect employment
commensurate with their education; and the middle class aspires to improved living
standards and a firmer sense o f economic and social security.
Governance Reforms: Strong macroeconomic fundamentals and outward looking
trade policies have been accompanied by reforms in governance that have progressively
increased efficiency and transparency, and have given Chile a well-deserved reputation
for “clean” and effective government. Out o f 159 countries assessed by Transparency
International in 2005, Chile was ranked twenty-first (between Ireland and Japan) with a
score o f 7.3 out o f a “clean” score o f 10. Indicators o f governance are shown in Figure 5.

Macroeconomic Outlook

25.

Looking ahead, the medium-term macroeconomic projections o f the Government
are for real GDP growth to stabilize at about 5.3 percent per annum, which the authorities
consider the country’s sustainable growth rate (Table 1). The strong macroeconomic
framework provides a solid basis for these projections, with stabilization policies having
enhanced the country’s growth prospects. Public savings have grown to the point where
the country i s a net creditor and the Government’s credibility as a debt issuer in
international markets has been further enhanced. Adverse shocks would be
counterbalanced by the Government’s ability to pursue counter-cyclical fiscal policies,
thereby reducing macroeconomic instability and ensuring the sustainability o f social
expenditures. In turn, the country i s expected to reap the socio-economic benefits o f the
increased social expenditures since the early-1990s in terms o f higher human capital and
productivity.

12

26.
Chile’s actual medium-term growth could well be higher than projected in the
authorities’ baseline scenario. The challenge now i s to foster policies, that encourage
innovation, enhance educational quality and attainment for all Chileans, and provide
adequate physical infrastructure for growth and improved competitiveness. To reap the
full benefits o f these investments in knowledge, human capital and infrastructure, further
steps may be needed to improve the functioning o f labor and capital markets, and to
strengthen the competition framework. The Bank has addressed these issues with the
authorities, first through a Chile Country Gender Assessment done with the InterAmerican Development Bank (IADB), which dealt with labor market issues, and through
the Development Policy Review, which provided the basis for discussion with the
authorities on business environment and competitiveness issues including the importance
o f strengthening capital markets and addressing labor market flexibility. In responding
to these challenges, Chile will also continue to face the tradeoffs in balancing the benefits
o f increased public spending on the one hand with avoiding the crippling effects on
competitiveness o f “Dutch disease” from the copper windfall on the other.

111. THEGOVERNMENT’S
DEVELOPMENT
VISION

The Government’s website (www.gobiemo.cl) provides a link to the Progrumu de
Gobierno. The Program describes a development agenda that was prepared by the
President-elect and her incoming team through an “intensive reflection and consultation
with thousands o f Chileans”. The description o f the program states that Chile i s entering
a “new stage o f development”, and that the success in traversing this stage will depend on
the continuation o f the strong growth, prudent macroeconomic management and outward
orientation that have come to identify Chile, President Bachelet’s administration has
elaborated on the program and specific themes during i t s first year in office. The defining
theme o f the Program i s making Chile more competitive and equitable by reducing
barriers to opportunity. The Program covers approximately 100 pages and addresses
dozens o f areas. The five elements identified below represent the core themes o f the
program as they relate to growth and equality o f opportunity. They are what the
Government sees as Chile’s most pressing development challenges.

27.

Social Policy

28.
The Bachelet administration sees social policy as “the basis for opportunity,” and
identifies a core set o f rights that together constitute i t s basic elements. The first o f these
i s education. The challenge i s to build on recent improvements in equity o f access.
Despite large increases in educational expenditures and coverage since 1990, the gap
between high and l o w income students in pre-school enrollment rates remains substantial.
Inequalities by ethnic background also persist and can determine the kind o f higher
education a young Chilean secondary school graduate can expect. W h i l e most students
attending private and traditional universities come from the highest income quintile,
youth from the lowest quintile are more likely to enroll in technical training centers; and
only 23 percent o f youth from indigenous backgrounds enroll in any type o f tertiary
education.
Educational quality also raises concerns. Chile appears to have managed a
29.
substantial increase in the number o f children in school (particularly poor children)
without a concomitant drop in quality. This i s a notable achievement. Nevertheless,
capitalizing on this success and closing the educational gap with more advanced
economies will be a challenge. National test scores in recent years show little or no
improvement. Comparing Chile’s scores with other countries reveals that much work
remains to be done. When the scores for the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA) tests are related to GDP per capita and expenditure per pupil, Chile’s
results are well below expectations. W h i l e 32 percent o f 15 year-olds in OECD countries
read at the top two levels assessed by PISA, only 6 percent o f Chilean students do. More
Chileans perform at the low end than the OECD average, and those at the high end in
Chile fare poorly when compared with similarly high-scoring-or even averagestudents from other countries.
30.
President Bachelet launched a Presidential Advisory Council on Education
Quality, which in December 2006 reported on i t s findings-key elements o f which

14

include systematic reforms o f the education ministry and the creation o f a
superintendence o f education to ensure compliance with quality standards. There are also
ambitious plans for technical training and lifelong learning to equip workers for a
changing economy. In higher education, a far-reaching reform plan has been outlined,
including the increasing use o f performance contracts and measures to determine the
allocation o f public funds.
31.
An important element o f the Government’s plans for strengthening social
protection i s improving health coverage. Despite enormous advances in health
indicators, health related expenses have contributed substantially to the impoverishment
o f Chilean households. More than 5 percent o f the total population o f the third income
quintile became poor in 2000 as a result o f health-related out-of-pocket expenses. Plan
Auge, the new health insurance package introduced in 2005 to increase effective coverage
among the most vulnerable, appears to be reducing the effects o f health costs. The
Government’s objectives are, first, to deliver on the promises o f Plan Auge, particularly
by increasing the number o f illnesses covered by the plan from 26 when the program was
started in 2005, to 56 by 2007, and 80 by 2010; and, second, to complete the institutional
reform o f the health system. Special attention will be paid to bring primary care closer to
families and communities, better coverage for the elderly, and to a public information
campaign to strengthen healthier lifestyle choices.
32.
The Government has committed to reform Chile’s innovative social security
system with the objective to broaden coverage and provide a minimum pension to all
Chileans. The system, which involves the private sector in managing pension hnds, has
reduced fiscal liabilities and helped deepen and strengthen the financial sector, but has
been less successful from a household perspective, particularly for low-income
households in which people are out o f work, self employed or work informally and thus
do not contribute to a private pension account. Over the past 15 years, the proportion o f
the labor force that contributes to the pension system in any given month has rarely been
higher than 60 percent, well below rates in the OECD. Most Chilean workers are able to
contribute only irregularly and with substantial interruptions; regulators estimate that well
over 50 percent o f participants will not be eligible for the minimum guaranteed pension.
33.
In March 2006, President Bachelet created a Pension Reform Advisory Council to
establish options for strengthening the pension system, and in December 2006 signed a
draft law to effect the far-reaching reforms identified by the Council. K e y changes
include creating a basic universal pension and a minimum pension to all Chileans aged 65
or more. Women will receive credits in their individual accounts to compensate for
childbearing years, and young poor workers will also receive a subsidy. The
participation o f independent workers will be compulsory (after a transition period o f six
years). There were proposed changes to the pension fund administrators regime (AFP),
including enabling the Superintendence o f Pensions to direct new customers to
administrators that offer the lowest commissions and allowing customers to compare bids
by Disability and Survivor’s Insurance plans, regardless o f the AFP with which they are
affiliated.

15

A Development Leap: Promoting Innovation
34.
Chile i s in a watershed period in its development history. Translating the current
fiscal, institutional and economic strength to lasting development will require greater
productivity.
The Government’s agenda begins with innovation. Chile lags
substantially behind comparator countries with respect to many indicators o f innovation.
By OECD standards, expenditure o n R&D i s l o w and the private sector’s participation
modest. Too few patents are issued and too much effort goes to basic, as opposed to
applied, research.
President Bachelet has underscored that becoming a knowledge
economy does not mean abandoning comparative advantages, but building o n them.
Chile, in other words, should not only export copper, salmon and wine, but develop the
technology used by miners, the viticultural methodologies to improve vineyard
production, and the aquaculture science to ensure the future health o f salmon stocks.

35.

In M a y 2006, President Bachelet launched a National Council o f Innovation for
Competitiveness. In January 2007, the Council delivered i t s findings and the President
highlighted k e y challenges, such as the distribution o f risks, opportunities and key
resources like human capital and financing. I t also found that connections among
educational institutions, industry and centers o f scientific research and technological
development need further development, and added that progress needs to be made on
productive decentralization, associations and collaboration among different parties
involved. The Government has launched Chile Compite to boost productivity,
competition, and innovation with an eye toward creating the conditions for higher
economic growth and employment, and in March 2007, started “Chile Invests” to focus
o n supporting entrepreneurs, globalizing Chile’s financial markets, reforming corporate
governance o f state owned enterprises, strengthening energy infrastructure, and making
Chile a more attractive tourist destination. Both programs focus o n supporting SMEs and
innovation by reducing regulation, lowering taxation, eliminating bottlenecks in
investment procedures, accelerating public spending initiatives, and supporting access to
long-term financing for SMEs.

36.
The Bachelet administration has signaled a new commitment to the environment
and to environmental management. Environmental concerns include a major industrial
spill in 2005; air pollution levels in Santiago similar to Mexico C i t y and twice as bad as
Los Angeles; and climate change impacts threatening water access in the country’s arid
and degraded regions. The OECD recently completed a review with recommendations for
elevating Chilean environmental management to OECD standards. The presidential
campaign saw widespread agreement across the political spectrum for reform. President
Bachelet has proposed to Congress the creation o f a new pollution control agency and to
elevate the country’s highest environmental official to ministerial rank. Government
priorities include protecting endangered ecosystems, developing the use o f alternative
fuels, reducing industrial emissions, cutting pollution in Santiago and other urban areas,
and expanding markets for carbon finance and ecological services. The Government has
announced an initiative dedicated to harnessing the contributions o f the public and private
lower pollution and
sectors to develop the basis for greater energy efficiency-and
greenhouse gas emissions-through conservation and greater use o f renewable sources.

16

Quality of Life: Infrastructure

37.
The Government has identified the third major area o f i t s development agenda as
“Improving the Quality o f L i f e for all Chileans”. An emphasis in this context i s
infrastructure, with the twin goals o f increasing access to public services and boosting
competitiveness and j o b creation. Chile’s commitment to public investment in
infrastructure has been impressive. The concessioning program under the Ministry o f
Public Works has risen from about 450 billion pesos in 1995 to over 1 trillion pesos in
2005 in real terms. More strikingly, the share o f private sector participation in yearly
investment levels has risen from 9 percent to 65 percent over the last decade. Altogether,
at between 5 and 7 percent o f GDP per year, Chile’s infrastructure investment levels are
similar to expenditure levels in East Asia’s high performing economies.
President Bachelet wants to build on these investments, and has identified
38.
eliminating the housing deficit as a major area o f emphasis. This initiative will not be
only about building and rehabilitating houses and apartments, but developing a housing
policy that serves to integrate Chilean society by breaking down walls between
socioeconomic classes. Another major area i s transportation, with the goal o f building a
safe, efficient and clean system. This priority has received new attention since the
difficult launching o f Transantiago in early 2007. To boost j o b creation and growth,
President Bachelet has created the Infrastructure Development for Competitiveness Plan
to ensure that public infrastructure can help different productive sectors be more efficient.
The Plan calls for a US$115 million increase in public spending on infrastructure in
2007, and it marks the first step in an ambitious program over four years, from 2007 to
2010. The Plan depends significantly o n private sector involvement, through improved
collaboration-in
announcing the Plan, the President noted that the Public Works
Ministry would be supervising infrastructure concessions worth US$2.2 billion between
2007 and 2010-and through tax incentives to stimulate private investment in public
roads. To ensure that public institutions are able to contract and deliver those
investments effectively and sustainably while protecting consumers’ interests, the “Chile
Invests’’ program specifically calls for the strengthening o f the Ministry o f Public Works.
This will entail the development o f integrated infrastructure planning; reorientation o f
contracts toward performance or service standards; greater accountability in project
management; and the strengthening o f oversight capacity for concessions and public
works alike.
New Citizen Compact

39.
The Government’s program emphasizes transparency and modernization of
government. President Bachelet underscored an active role for Government, to defend
the state, help the poor when markets fail to, and guarantee education and health. To do
this, public institutions need to be transparent and effective. One priority area in this
context i s regional development. Chile i s a highly centralized country. Local issues,
including the problems associated with wide economic and social disparities between the
country’s regions, have not received the kind o f attention they might in a more
decentralized governing structure. President Bachelet has committed to move in this

17

direction, and devolve decision-making and responsibility for public services closer to the
consumers o f those services. The Government launched the Regional Productive
Development Agencies in thirteen regions to promote sustainable development and a
more competitive Chile. It also established Chile Emprende to support small and microsized businesses throughout the country and in targeted territories.

Ending Discrimination
40.
The Government recognizes that progress in social inclusion is important not just
for moral reasons, but for the economic and social development o f the country. As
President Bachelet said in her inaugural speech, “Chile will be a more developed, just and
democratic country when powerful barriers to women and indigenous people in the
workplace, culture, economy and public sphere come down”. She underscored this point
by linking the presence o f previously excluded Chileans in the workforce as crucial to
defeating poverty and becoming a more competitive country. In this context, much
attention is being paid to incorporating more effectively the poor, particularly poor
women, into the labor market. During the fast growth years o f 1990 and 2003, the total
number o f people in the labor market increased by 28 percent, with much o f this made up
o f unskilled and semi-skilled women.

Iv. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE OF THE CPS
The objective o f the CPS i s to support Chile’s efforts to converge with OECD
income levels and living standards by (i)accelerating sustainable growth and (ii)
increasing equality o f opportunity. The subjects identified below represent areas which
Chile has identified as important for i t s development vision and where, in the context o f
productive engagement with the Bank, i t perceives the Bank Group might be well
positioned to provide assistance (see Annex I).
In many cases, they are areas where
effective cooperation i s already underway. They are grouped below for presentation
purposes around the twin objectives o f sustainable growth and equality o f opportunity.

The IFC i s well positioned to support the Government’s development vision and
complement the Bank’s interventions. Efforts will be geared toward filling the gaps in
access to long-tern financing in high impact areas, such as access to finance for SMEs
and micro-enterprises; low-income housing and education; sustainability finance; and
infrastructure. The I F C i s particularly interested in addressing high impact areas by
leveraging i t s structured finance products, providing technical assistance and advisory
services, and through i t s traditional product lines, both with direct investments and
through wholesaling. The IFC has identified infrastructure, and more specifically, energy
as the main area o f increased Bank Group coordination.

o f agri-business innovation down to the level o f medium and small farmers.
44.
Another important area for growth is infrastructure and public services. Chile
has done much to stimulate the involvement o f the private sector in infrastructure
development, and today has what may be the world’s most extensive concession
program, encompassing roads, rail, ports, bridges, tunnels, reservoirs and canals. More
can be done, however, to leverage the private sector and improve the use o f public
resources for works projects. The authorities have initiated a program to strengthen the
Ministry o f Public Works, and have asked the Bank for support to bring state-of-the-art
knowledge to achieve further efficiencies in this important area via a TAL and a DPL.
The Government remains committed to improving the performance o f the Transantiago
urban transport system, and the Bank i s providing support through a technical assistance
loan to improve implementation and evaluation. There have been useful discussions,
especially with the IFC, on a role for the Bank Group in housing. The IFC will also seek
to support IBRD’s work with the Ministry o f Public Works in areas such as innovative
public private partnerships that might need a demonstration effect to attract commercial
funding, e.g. in the area o f health and education.
45.
Finally, Chile recognizes that i t needs to accelerate steps towards greater energy
security, including by reducing i t s dependence on natural gas supplies from Argentina
(see B o x 4). As part o f the Country’s Energy Security Strategy, for which the authorities
have requested the Bank’s views, the Government i s moving forward with a program to
develop the basis for greater energy efficiency through conservation and greater use o f
renewable sources. The I F C i s also prepared to help advance Chile’s energy security by
assisting efforts to both increase and diversify supply, with a focus on renewable energy.
The IFC will work in close coordination with C O W 0 to leverage both institutions’
capacity and resources in this area.

19

Box 4: The Energy Situation in Chile
Chile faces near term energy supply risks. Respondents to a questionnaire as part o f the Bank’s Investment
Climate Survey ranked electricity restrictions as a substantial impediment t o growth in Chile. Eighteen
percent o f firms stated that they were constrained by electricity supply issues. Restrictions in gas supplies
f r o m Argentina, which started in 2004, are likely t o increase. Finding alternative supplies will be costly.
Background: Chile has undertaken systemic reform to the country’s power sector, beginning in the early
1980s t o increase competition and improve quality and service. These improvements were aided by
increasing privatization. At the same time, regulatory changes placed greater responsibility o n generators
t o improve service further, including by compensating customers in the event o f rationing, such as was
imposed during two years o f l o w precipitation in 1998 and 1999, which slowed hydro power and l e d to
rolling blackouts, and by boosting investment in n e w generation and transmission infrastructure.
Chile’s’energy m k Sixty percent o f installed capacity comes f r o m thermal generation, with a further 4 0
percent f r o m hydroelectric sources. In terms o f generation, the figures are reversed, with 44 percent f r o m
thermal sources, 52 percent f r o m hydro, and 4 percent f r o m other sources (including renewables and selfgeneration). The bulk o f Chile’s hydro capacity lies within the SIC, and thermal within the S I N G networks.
Historical Capacity Growth has been strong, averaging about 430MW, or 4 percent growth per year since
2000. Increasing conflicts with environmental permitting for hydropower sources and cuts in Argentine
gas supplies have meant that thermal capacity has had an increasingly important role in the capacity mix
over this period. However, there has been a slowdown in investment during 2005 and 2006.
Argentine Gas has also been a major fillip t o growth in thermal capacity. Introduced in the late 1990’s
through pipelines, the availability o f Argentine gas lead t o a significant drop in electricity prices in Chile,
and has helped t o dramatically reduce the air pollution in Santiago. However, high internal demand and
underinvestment led Argentina during 2005 to apply unilateral export restrictions, cutting shipments to
Chile equaling 2 0 percent o f normal consumption. Moreover, emerging concerns regarding the extent o f
Argentina’s proven gas reserves have raised doubts about Argentina’s supply over the long term.

This has l e f t Chile, which imports more than 72 percent o f i t s energy (up f r o m 48 percent in 1990), with
few options. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has so far been the dominant strategy to reduce reliance o n
Argentina. But there are demand questions, with the price for imported LNG l i k e l y to be 50 percent higher
than the price currently paid for Argentine gas. Hydropower is also crucial, and remains the provider o f the
largest share o f Chilean generation. With the low-cost hydro resources in the central part o f the country
already having been developed, the remaining significant reserves are in remote parts o f the country.
Environmental and indigenous land rights concerns have slowed development o f Chile’s energy resources.
Regulatory issues, including restrictions o n setting tariffs and the obligation o f producers t o compensate
customers for shortages, raise supply-side risks and have l e d to underinvestment. Legal reforms were made
in 2004 and 2005 t o provide incentives for investment in power generation and to promote renewable
energies. However, a gap between demand and supply i s very likely in the short term. Average demand
growth during 2000 to 2005 was 6 percent-current forecasts suggest it will be as high as 7 percent over
the coming years. This translates into a requirement for an additional 4 0 0 M W o f new capacity annually.
Outlook: The Government has advanced emergency measures for the short term to promote generation and
conservation during peak hours. Over the medium term, Chile needs to expand energy sources and
strengthen efficiency policies and incentives. With greater regional integration to tap vast natural gas
sources f r o m Bolivia unlikely, the Government can invest in LNG terminals, while making clear i t s plans
t o exit once the market i s sufficiently developed. I t will also have to consider clean coal-fired technology,
and agree o n expanded use o f hydro-power, balancing environmental and social concerns. Nuclear power
has been discussed, but nuclear plants are large for Chile’s grid and would likely face intense opposition.
Possible Role for the Bank Group: The Government has expressed interest in the Bank’s review o f i t s
long-term energy strategy. The I F C i s working with C O W 0 o n renewable energy and supply
diversification. The Bank Group i s coordinating i t s work in Chile’s energy sector.

20

46.
As indicated in surveys undertaken by the Bank and Transparency International,
Chile has established a reputation for probity and effectiveness in public sector
management. The Government continues to seek best practice for public sector
strengthening. The Bank has worked closely with the authorities in this regard with the
Integrated Financial Management System (SIGFE) project to strengthen public
expenditure management. Demand for continued support remains strong, with the
Government having requested a follow-on SIGFE project, which will focus on
modernizing the financial information system at the national level, improve monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms for the budget process, and strengthen financial
administration at the municipal level. The Government has also requested ongoing
support in the area o f decentralization and regional development; in a country with
Chile’s geography, how decision-making i s distributed among government entities can
have important implications for social inclusion (discussed below under “Equality o f
Opportunity”). Finally, the Government has requested two new products on a fee-forservice basis, including a study on the Impact o f Chile’s Management Enhancement
Program and an advisory service on the management o f Chile’s growing financial assets.
47.
Chile i s a country which depends significantly on the environment and natural
resources, including extractive industries. I t i s designated under the Bank’s Extractive
Industry policy as a “Country with Substantial Resources” generated from extractive
industries. The IFC i s a shareholder o f Escondida, one o f Chile’s largest private copper
mining companies, and the Bank Group i s engaged with the authorities on the
management o f resources derived from natural resources, particularly copper. The
request for a study, to be performed on a fee-for-service basis, o n managing i t s growing
financial assets i s an example o f engagement. More generally, Chile’s commitment to
ensure that the substantial copper export revenues benefit all Chileans, today and for
generations to come, i s evident. The authorities have taken a number o f effective and
innovative steps toward this end. The adoption o f the Fiscal Rule to further enhance
transparency to the allocation o f copper revenues, the creation o f the Pension Reserve
Fund, the recapitalization o f the Central Bank, and the Social and Economic Stabilization
Fund (see B o x 3) demonstrate the determination with which Chile has managed i t s
copper resources for the country’s long term benefit.
48.
The Bank Group i s working with the Government on key rural and
environmental issues. The Bank and the Ministry o f Agriculture and CONAMA,
Chile’s environment agency, have discussed support in a range o f areas, both separately
and in collaboration on cross-sectoral issues. The Government has set ambitious targets
for simultaneously expanding Chile’s agriculture-based exports-it aims to become one
o f the world’s top-ten exporters o f agriculture by 2010 (Chile i s now 17)-while
maximizing the participation o f small farmers in agro-processing and export chains. This
has generated engagement on helping small farmers innovate and access technology,
deliver rural productive services in the context o f local needs, and strengthen the
country’s regional collaboration on issues o f animal health, including avian flu.
C O N A M A has indicated interest in support in institutional strengthening in light o f
recently approved reform legislation-building
on the constructive policy and
institutional role the Bank played in the 1990s when C O N A M A was first created.

21

49.
The GEF pipeline includes several biodiversity and land degradation projects, as
well as technical assistance to better integrate biodiversity concerns in national
infrastructure planning. Climate change adaptation and urban air pollution are other
areas o f concern being addressed with grant financing already in place. Carbon finance
engagement ranges from hydro-power, to solid waste management, to reforestation.
Finally, both C O N A M A and the Ministry o f Agriculture are working together to
introduce concepts o f territorial development in both rural development and natural
resources management. They have expressed interest in Bank support to operationalize
this approach in two concrete areas: first, in introducing market-based instruments (Le.,
ecological service markets) for reducing resource degradation and improving water
resources management; and second, to use territorial development concepts to better
target the rural services provided by 21 different agencies in 100 o f the country’s poorest
rural communities.

50.

With respect to sustainability finance, the I F C will combine investment, technical

assistance, carbon finance facilities and, where appropriate, Global Environment Facility
(GEF) funding, to seek to support projects that result in environmental upgrades, energy
efficiency and carbon emission reductions. The priority in implementing the strategy will
be given to projects that can be scaled up or replicated, and to wholesaling in order to
extend IFC’s impact indirectly to projects that cannot benefit from i t s direct support.

Equality o f Opportunity

5 1.
The key in this context, in Chile as elsewhere, i s improving the quality and equity
o f education. The authorities have requested technical assistance in the design o f the
new superintendence o f education, which would be an independent institution charged
with quality assurance in education, from preschool through higher education. The
authorities have also expressed interest in Bank support to strengthen early childhood
education; enhance the institutional capacity o f the ministry o f education and related
agencies for education quality assurance, and address the various challenges o f raising
the quality and relevance o f technical-professional education, lifelong learning
opportunities, and tertiary education.

52.
Chile’s proactive investments in social protection programs in the years since the
down-turn o f 1998 have been effective in providing protection against severe social
dislocation and supporting economic recovery. Looking forward, the Government i s
intent o n understanding the strengths and weaknesses o f these programs, and has asked
for the Bank’s assistance in this context. Discussions are underway regarding continued
Bank support to the Ministry o f Planning and Cooperation (MIDEPLAN), importantly
including the construction o f an integrated evaluation system.
53.
A key challenge for promoting social inclusion under the public sector
strengthening framework i s regional development, particularly reducing the sharp
economic and social disparities between regions. In this context, the Government has
welcomed the recommendations in the Bank’s Zonas Extremas study, and has
incorporated the key findings in i t s 2005 budget report to Congress. The Government has

22

now asked the Bank to build on this work by preparing a regional development strategy
using region I(Tarapac6) and the newly created region XV (Arica and Parinacota) as a
pilot study for the other regions. The Government requested that this be one o f the two
AAA tasks planned for FY07. This continuing collaboration is likely to strengthen the
Bank’s relationship with Chile in this area, and might be an important entry point for
future Bank involvement in a broader discussion o f decentralization, bolstering o f the
management capacity o f regional and municipal government, and cross-sectoral
approaches to improve development planning. One way the Government is seeking to
reduce inequities in public services i s by strengthening the role o f civil society
organizations in the Government’s development agenda, though greater social
accountability, and has signaled interest in Bank support in this area. The I F C will also
seek to focus on projects that impact the frontier regions-those with a GDP per capita
below 70 percent o f the average national GDP per capita.

The activities under the program which have already been identified and

Portfolio
55.
Chile’s portfolio consists o f six investment operations and four GEF and Carbon
Finance projects. The investment projects represent U S $ l 9 0 m i l l i o n in commitments and
an undisbursed balance of US$116 million. The overall implementation o f the portfolio
i s considered satisfactory, with a strong results orientation and development focus. One
project (Infrastructure for Territorial Development), has been downgraded due largely to
the complex institutional setting that ensued following a change in the counterpart. The
Bank i s working proactively with the authorities to address outstanding concerns.

IFC
56.
The I F C i s w e l l positioned to support the Government’s development vision and
complement the Bank’s interventions. Efforts will be geared toward filling the gaps in
access to long-tern financing in high impact areas, such as access to finance for SMEs
and micro-enterprises; low-income housing and education; sustainability finance; and
infrastructure. The I F C is particularly interested in addressing high impact areas by
leveraging i t s structured finance products, providing technical assistance and advisory
services, and through i t s traditional product lines, both with direct investments and
through wholesaling.
Box 6: IBRD - IFC Coordination
The CPS seeks to establish a program o f support to Chile, which, whenever appropriate, can deliver
coordinated services in focused, sector-specific areas. Initial areas o f possible coordination have been
identified within the framework o f the institutions’ relatively selective programs in niche areas. Additional
areas will be determined o n a “real time” basis through dialogue with the authorities depending o n demand.
This i s consistent with the flexible CPS where the program will evolve based o n consultation. The key to
effective coordination for the Bank and the IFC will be to retain agility t o ensure timeliness and flexibility
in response t o client requests.
Energy Security. The Government has identified energy security as a k e y development challenge, and has
asked the Bank t o review its long term energy strategy. The Bank and the IFC have established the basis
for effective coordinated support in the context o f the implementation o f the Government’s strategy. The
IFC i s working with C O W 0 o n renewable sources and supply diversification. The Ministry o f Economy
is requesting the Bank to be the implementing agency for GEF support t o the Energy Efficiency Program.
This i s an area in which the I F C has experience and expertise in other countries. The Bank is supporting
through carbon finance three hydropower projects (Chacabuquito, Hornitos, and Quilleco) and are
appraising a fourth, Laja hydro. The IFC has developed a solid pipeline o f energy projects. Teams f r o m
the Bank and the IFC w i l l be in regular contact to ensure that the Bank Group’s contribution in the energy
sector leverages the strengths and experienced o f their respective institutions.
Possible Future Areas of Collaboration. The Bank and the IFC are either providing support to, or have
discussed with the authorities the possibility o f assisting in, the environment, tertiary education, housing
and infrastructure. Teams f r o m b o t h institutions are reviewing where there m a y be possible niche areas o f
h t u r e coordination.
Ensuring a Fast, Agile, Coordinated Response. Collaboration will be driven by client demand and the
nature o f the planned interventions. Staff at the sector and project level will be best suited t o identify and
carry out the coordinated implementation. Regional management will monitor and facilitate the overall
effort.

24

v. PRINCIPLES OF BANKENGAGEMENT
57.
The rationale for continued World Bank support to Chile i s driven, first, by
development need. As described in the CPS, despite substantial advances in economic
growth and living standards, poverty and inequality in Chile remain acute and an
important social concern. Chile has established for i t s e l f the goal o f joining the ranks
OECD countries, to compete in commercial and financial terms, and converge with
income levels and standard o f living. The Government recognizes that to make this leap
i t needs the contribution o f every single Chilean, and it has developed a coherent
development program to make this possible. The Bank believes this program merits
support.
The second basis for support i s strong client demand. Chile i s not reliant on
58.
World Bank financing; substantial fiscal surpluses and the projected continuation o f high
copper prices imply that borrowing from the Bank will remain modest. The authorities
nevertheless see the value o f continued World Bank engagement, and have requested a
flexible mix o f financial and advisory services to support the country’s development
strategy. This is based on the Bank’s o w n expertise, including the supervision and
implementation o f projects, and international experience, and also on the positive
reputational effects o f maintaining a partnership with the World Bank Group. The third
basis on which to move forward with Chile i s to test the Bank’s ability to respond to the
rapidly evolving requests o f MICs, particularly to deliver just-in-time knowledge services
and facilitate global experience and know-how within the framework o f a project or
through non-lending services. Fourth and finally, Chile’s record o f economic reform,
strong growth and poverty reduction provides valuable lessons to share with all o f the
Bank’s member countries and with the international community more broadly. Many o f
the programs that Chile has already launched to fight structural poverty and implement
anti-cyclical fiscal policy can be considered best practices around the world.
Stakeholder Consultations

59.
The CPS i s based on intensive consultation. The Bank has engaged substantially
with the Bachelet Government, through Policy Notes, a Development Policy Review and
in discussions in preparation for the CPS, including a day-long seminar in Santiago
October 2006 with key government stakeholders on the six main focus areas identified in
the CPS. Senior staff have participated in dialogue with government officials and key
stakeholders on priority issues such as pension reform, education, infancy and regional
development. In many cases, the Bank’s dialogue took place as part o f its participation in
high-level Presidential Commissions which involved substantial citizen involvement.
Senior Bank staff, led by the Country Director, travel to Chile regularly as part o f
ongoing dialogue, in a l l parts o f the country, with civil society, local government
officials, school and university officials, and other key stakeholders. The Bank has also
carried out a client survey, the results o f which are summarized in B o x 7 . The Bank
plans to follow-up on the findings o f the Client Survey for further elaboration on those
areas where the Bank may be able to strengthen its interventions in Chile.

25

Box 7: Chile Client Survey: Main Findings and Lessons
To better understand the environment in Chile and h o w the W o r l d Bank i s perceived by i t s m a i n
interlocutors and other stakeholders and opinion-makers, the Bank commissioned a client survey t o be
carried out prior to preparation o f the CPS. The survey was conducted between December 2005 and
January 2006. O f 132 persons invited to participate in the survey, 129 completed the questionnaire.
Participants were drawn f r o m the executive branch, parliament, employees o f ministries and ministerial
departments, local governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies, the private sector, NGOs, academia and
the media. Nearly a l l the respondents were located in Santiago.
Take Away Message: Education i s the “hot button” issue in Chile. Income inequality and social exclusion
are also concerns, but education emerges as the top issue which most respondents believe holds the key to
addressing long-standing social problems.
Familiarity: Respondents knew the B a n k well, with the average rating for a l l respondents at more
than 7 out o f 10 (ten being “extremely familiar with the Bank”) and nearly a l l indicating that they have
been involved with or a close observer o f the Bank for more than three years.
Where i s Chile? One notable finding, given that the survey was conducted immediately after a
national election, was the general optimism the respondents felt about Chile’s future. When asked
about perceptions about the future o f the next generation in Chile, the overall mean rating was 7.7 o n a
10 point scale, with 1 being extremely pessimistic and 10 being extremely optimistic.
Development Priorities: Respondents overwhelmingly identified poor education as the issue most
likely to affect sustainable growth and development in Chile, and that improving educational access
and quality was the most important development priority.
This was followed in b o t h cases by
concerns about social exclusion and making growth more inclusive.
Bank Involvement in Chile: Notwithstanding Chile’s long term success, high copper prices and
strong fiscal position, more than 90 percent o f respondents believed that the Bank should maintain (61
percent) o r increase (3 1 percent) i t s level o f involvement in Chile. Respondents from the private sector
and academia were more likely to say that the Bank should be more involved.
The Bank’s Role: Respondents indicated that the Bank can be most productive and valuable in
supporting education. Other areas high o n the agenda included strengthening the public sector,
ensuring the environmental health and probity o f Bank projects, and support to the health sector.
Effectiveness: Respondents gave the Bank a rating o f 6.3 out o f ten in terms o f overall effectiveness.
While this can be improved, it i s welcome that the effectiveness ratings are relatively high for top
priority areas, including, among others, education, governance, infrastructure, and natural resources
management. Indeed, there was a relatively strong convergence between those areas which the
respondents believed to be top priority and where the Bank was considered t o be effective.
Working Relations: Across a l l respondents, there was solid agreement that the Bank has established
good relationships in Chile, “treats clients and stakeholders with respect” (8.1 out o f lo), and
collaborates w e l l with the Government. Less favorable were ratings for the Bank’s record in helping
to build capacity at the community level and in supporting country ownership o f development
strategies.
Lessons: The most important signal t o come out o f the survey was t o confirm Chile’s determined
focus on education. The Government has committed t o this in rhetoric and in terms o f i t s early action.
Second, despite the fact that the Bank i s considered effective in i t s w o r k in high priority areas for
Chile, respondents do n o t consider the Bank especially relevant t o Chile’s development. This m a y
reflect a matter-of-fact understanding o f the modest amount o f financial support the Bank actually
provides Chile, and o f Chile’s strong financial position. Nevertheless, given the Government’s
continued demand for Bank engagement-particularly
i t s knowledge services-the
Bank can do a
better j o b articulating the value o f this work to Chile’s development vision.

26

Partnership

60.

The Bank Group’s program i s being coordinated with Chile’s other development
partners, notably the IMF and the
IADB. The joint World Bank-IMF FSAP was
completed in August 2004. The IMF completed the last Article I V for Chile in August
2006, when Fund Directors commended the Chilean authorities for their continued
“exemplary” implementation o f sound macroeconomic policies, strong institutions,
disciplined fiscal stance, vigilant inflation targeting, robust approach to trade, and robust
financial systems. The Bank i s working closely with the IABD on all fiduciary products,
including the last C F A A and on developing new options for country systems in
procurement. The two Banks also coordinated closely on the Country Gender Study.
The most recent IADB Country Strategy, which was presented to the IADB Board in
January 2007, envisages continued engagement with proposed lending o f approximately
US$350 million.
Country Systems

61.
The Bank’s ability to respond to Chile’s requests will require greater flexibility,
including increased use o f country systems consistent with the recent Bank efforts to
enhance engagement with middle income countries. In the past, the Bank’s reliance on
country systems has been focused on financial management. Less flexibility has been
exercised with procurement country systems, which has emerged as a concern with the
authorities. The basis for moving forward proactively in this context i s strong, as Chile’s
fiduciary country systems are highly reliable, and provide the space for expanded reliance
with no diminution o f fiduciary control.
Financial Management. As mentioned in the 2005 Country Financial
62.
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Chile scores high on financial management outputs
in fiscal discipline, transparency and supporting efficiency in operations.
This
perfonnance i s aided by strict adherence to a clear set o f rules, dedicated and qualified
staff, and strong management which ensures accountability in a system in which
substantial responsibilities are decentralized to service agencies. This solid basis o f clear
rules and strict behavior allow Chile to attain high standards o f public financial
management, such as OECD Budget Practices.
There is, however, room for
improvement and the Government i s modernizing the Integrated Financial Management
System (SIGFE) with the support o f the Bank. Chile’s strong perfonnance in public
financial management (PFM) has enabled the Bank to increase its reliance on country
systems for budget process, execution, accounting and audit; and dialogue has been
initiated with the authorities to harmonize Bank and IADB reporting requirements. Other
areas s t i l l require attention. One in particular relates to Chile’s supreme audit institution
(SAI). To remain one o f the world’s leading public audit institutions, the SA1 could
usefully review i t s wide-ranging hnctions to determine those which i t alone can fulfill
and those which can be more effectively carried out by other agencies.

63.
Procurement. The quality o f the national procurement system in Chile has
improved significantly over the past decade, thanks substantially to the Government’s

27

commitment to transparency and efficiency. As a result, Chile’s procurement system
now has the confidence o f the public, the bidding community and civil society. The
Government recognizes, however, that notwithstanding i t s high ratings in the
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index and enhanced reputation, the
conduct o f public procurement in Chile today may s t i l l retain some features that differ
from internationally recognized good procurement practice. Therefore, i t has called upon
the World Bank and the IADB for help in identifying these remaining areas through a
rigorous assessment o f i t s system, focusing on, among other things: the strength o f the
procurement regulatory framework; the ability o f Government agencies to carry out dayto-day procurement transactions and how well they achieve value for money; the capacity
o f the market to respond to public procurement opportunities; and how well the
participants in the procurement process comply with existing anti-corruption and other
control measures.

64.
The World Bank and the IADB responded with an update o f the latest Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) using the July 2006 version o f the OECD-DAC
Benchmarking and Assessment Tool for Public Procurement Systems. The assessment
involves a broad cross-section o f national agencies and the results are expected in June
2007 when the Government and the Banks will jointly review and validate them. These
results are expected to demonstrate the competitiveness, transparency and efficiency o f
the system, as well as i t s consistency with the Banks’ procurement policies. The findings
will enable the World Bank to start developing an appropriate framework for moving
towards greater reliance on the country’s capacity, consistent with the Bank’s
commitments under the Paris Declaration. The phased approach is outlined in B o x 8 o n
the next page.

28

Box 8: Procurement Arrangements to be used under Bank lending in the CPS
Phase I:The Bank will conduct an assessment o f the domestic market and, on the basis o f results, consider
raising current thresholds for use o f NCB procedures in new operations up to U S $ l O million for works and
US$500,000 for goods. This increase i s permitted under existing Bank policy. Thresholds for prior review
by the Bank will be based on the procurement risk assessed on a project-by-project basis, as per current
policy.
Phase 11: Pending presentation and discussion by the Bank’s Board o f the policy on Procurement Country
Systems, the current strategy for Phase I1 i s to be based on the results o f the market assessment, as well as
the benchmarking exercise and subsequent annual updates. If justified by the results, further incremental
changes will be introduced to reflect the specific improvements that have occurred in terms o f performance,
compliance, reduced risk and improved outcomes in the implementing entities. This process will continue
until such time as the thresholds in effect reach US$25 million (the maximum amount possible under
existing Bank policy). Prior review thresholds will continue to be determined as specified for Phase I.
Phase 111: will consist o f preparing a proposal for Bank management and the Board outlining the
achievements made during the latest annual assessment. These results will provide the basis for
recommending further reliance on the procurement system in Chile, in accordance with Bank policy.
Phase I

Phases I1 and I11

,500,000 for works;

S$5,000,000 for works

29

65.
Safeguards: Chile has a strong system o f social and environmental safeguards,
particularly in terms o f the legal and policy environment. Projects are categorized
according to potential risk, magnitude and importance o f environmental impacts, similar
to the World Bank’s approach. Two different types o f environmental assessments are
carried out, based on project category. The Bank i s prepared to work with Chile to
strengthen i t s capacity to consider social and environmental issues, particularly in terms
o f improved implementation capacity. Based on the strong legal and policy environment,
and the Government’s commitment to addressing environmental and social impacts, Chile
i s a strong candidate for making use o f the country’s own systems and gradually reducing
the prescriptive approach to safeguards in Bank-funded operations. This i s expected to
bring about a more sustainable and consistent approach to safeguards at the country level,
with reduced transaction costs and improved quality and consistency in individual
operations.
Country Financing Parameters

66.
The Country Financing Parameters (see Annex IV) were discussed with the
Government o f Chile, which welcomed the increased flexibility that the new Bank policy
provides with regard to eligible expenditures. The degree to which the Government
would l i k e to use the increased flexibility depends largely on i t s strategy for funding
development needs. The degree to which the Bank will use the increased flexibility will
in turn depend on the Bank’s overall planned country exposure, the impact on the Bank’s
ability to fund other projects under the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the
potential to reduce transaction costs.
In terms o f cost sharing, the new policy allows the Bank to finance up to 100
67.
percent o f costs o f individual projects if necessary. The proposed flexibility will be
established within the Bank’s planned exposure. N o specific sector priorities are being
established. Ownership, the impact on the Bank’s ability to fund other projects under the
CPS and the potential to reduce transaction costs will be considered in deciding the
financing share o f individual projects.

68.
With regard to financing o f recurrent costs, given Chile’s sound fiscal
management and the existence o f a very good budget system that indicates financing o f
recurrent costs would not jeopardize overall fiscal and debt sustainability, no countrylevel limit is proposed on recurrent cost financing. Recurrent expenditures may therefore
be financed as deemed necessary and appropriate in individual projects o n a case by case
basis. In determining Bank financing o f recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank
will take into account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels.
69.
In terms o f local cost financing, Bank criteria for financing o f local costs are met.
Therefore, the Bank may finance local costs in the appropriate proportion needed for each
project.

30

Financial Products

70.
The expanded array o f financing and risk management products offered by
IBRD provides an additional instrument for responding to the client under the CPS. The
Government has asked for the Bank’s advisory services related to portfolio management
and strategic asset allocation o f the large and growing reserves resulting from Chile’s
copper windfall and targeted to the Pension Reserve Fund and the Social and Economic
Stabilization Fund (see Box 3). The authorities have asked the Bank for support in (i)
instituitional strengthening, to carry out a diagnostic study on Chile’s capacity to manage
the funds; (ii)
investment policies, to review Chile’s investment portfolio in terms o f
instruments, risks, maturities, etc; and (iii)the contracting o f external investment
administrators, including advice on their selection, retention, remuneration, and
evaluation. This work would build on the Bank’s ongoing advisory service on the
management o f public financial assets. The Bank’s Latin America and Caribbean
Department and Treasury are working together to respond to this request.
71.
Over the medium term there could be additional interest in utilizing the Bank’s
Treasury Department to assist with capacity building. O n the liability management side,
IBRD’s menu o f banking products could assist Chile in managing i t s sovereign risks, in
particular commodity price volatility risks.
CAS Completion Report - 2002-2006 CAS

72.
The CAS Completion Report for the 2002 CAS identifies a number o f important
lessons that have informed the preparation o f the 2007 CPS. The first relates to the
soundness o f an approach in Chile that recognizes a strong track record and coherent
vision and delivers support to the Government’s program. The Bank was successful in
helping the Government move forward with i t s development agenda, although the
operational modalities have sometimes differed from those envisaged in the CAS. This
suggests that a flexible CPS i s an appropriate way to structure the Bank’s program in
Chile. I t has already led to innovative thinking and positive outcomes.
73.
The 2002 CAS also demonstrated the difficulty o f identifying with specificity the
contribution o f Bank interventions to overall country outcomes. The Completion Report
identifies as a key lesson that in Chile the Bank should acknowledge that country strategy
outcomes primarily reflect the efforts o f the Government and the country.
74.
A major area o f instruction from the 2002 CAS i s the value o f the analytical
engagement. This i s illustrated by the extent o f the Government’s demand, which
resulted in a program o f AAA products that in number far exceeded what had been
originally planned. I t i s also indicated by the strong relationship between the analytical
products and eventual lending. Many o f the most successful cases o f partnership with the
Government have begun with AAA on policy matters which pointed the way to
actionable reforms.

31

75.
One important lesson for the 2007 CPS remains the importance o f pushing
forward with country systems, particularly in procurement. Projects supported by Bank
lending sometimes encountered problems o f contracting and procurement which reflected
the view o f the Chilean authorities that their own procurement procedures are w e l l
developed and effective. Lesson: The Bank should focus on streamlining i t s contracting
and procurement requirements and should incorporate country systems to the extent
possible.
76.
The last lesson relates to the effectiveness o f Bank assistance in mobilizing
international expertise on key development issues o f interest to Chile. Analytic work that
has been undertaken jointly with other international organizations such as the IMF, the
IADB and the OECD has been well received in Chile. This includes a financial sector
assessment, a country financial accountability assessment and a country gender
assessment. Lesson: The Bank should continue to work closely with other international
agencies in i t s program o f assistance to Chile.

VI. STRUCTURE OF THE CPS

77.
The 2007 Chile CPS describes a flexible program approach. I t envisages an
indicative lending program o f between US$200 and US$250 million. I t i s unlikely that
the authorities would seek to exceed this amount. However, given Chile’s investment
grade status and strong performance, were the Government to request it, the Bank would
have the flexibility to increase the lending envelope significantly during the course o f the
CPS.
Results Monitoring

- 78.
.

The Chile CPS contains a strong orientation toward achieving realistic outcomes
and a results-oriented monitoring and evaluation system. However, developing a results
framework which specifies expected linkages between the Bank’s interventions and long
term development goals for a flexible program o f support such as described in the Chile
CPS i s a challenge. This i s partly because o f the relatively small scale o f the Bank’s
financial support. The CPS envisions modest IBRD lending, often to leverage Bank
expertise in areas which the Government has identified as a major priority and to which i t
i s committing substantial resources (e.g. innovation, tertiary education). I t i s also
because o f the nature o f the Bank’s evolving role as a knowledge partner. The bulk o f
the Bank’s support under the CPS will be AAA and advisory services, the evaluation o f
which presents inherent difficulties. This i s especially true in Chile, where the
Government i s requesting support on a “real-time” basis, and often for input to the policy
process, in which the authorities are drawing on multiple sources o f advice, and not, in
every case, to the formulation or implementation o f the policies themselves. This fluidity
in demand, and the fact that the program will be fully defined only in i t s later years
following ongoing dialogue, makes an ex ante identification o f inputs and results
difficult.

32

79.
In this context, the CPS seeks to meet the core objective o f a results-based
Country Strategy by presenting a results framework that establishes relationships between
interventions and outcomes; contains measurable indicators; and describes arrangements
for collection, analysis, and use o f data to monitor results, while pragmatically reflecting
the nature o f the Bank’s business in Chile. I t presents a results framework which
evaluates the CPS along three distinct dimensions. First, as the CPS i s driven by the
Government’s program, the evaluation o f the CPS will be based on how effective the
Government i s in achieving i t s development vision, as determined by a select set o f
country development goals. Second, the knowledge products-the core o f the CPS-are
designed to contribute to the policy process. These products will not be linked to country
outcomes per se, but rather be judged on criteria o f their quality, relevance and
sustainability. Third, there i s an investment component to the CPS, though o f very
limited scale. Given this, the results matrix will evaluate the investment projects
supported by the Bank by their specific project indicators and the overall portfolio
performance.
Expanded Fee-for-Service Relationship

80.

The demand by the Government for the Bank’s analytical work has been
substantial in recent years, far outstripping the scheduled products identified in the 2002
CAS. Meeting this demand going forward will require an expansion, and elaboration, o f
the existing fee-based arrangement, which over the past two years, for example, has
enabled important studies in the areas o f transport, management o f contingent liabilities,
the monitoring and evaluation o f social service programs and on the implementation o f a
risk-based supervision approach in the pension, securities and insurance areas. The Bank
proposes to build o n this record o f success, and to work with the authorities in moving
toward a more streamlined approach in developing a fee-for-service joint studies
arrangement taking into account developments in other well-performing MICs.

The goal o f a fee-for-service joint studies framework agreement will be to move
8 1.
beyond the case-by-case, ad-hoc approach toward an arrangement that would allow for
greater certainty in planning and financing, be cost effective to the client, and
administratively flexible to ensure that program aims are not frustrated by internal
accounting requirements. I t would allow both the Bank and the client to develop an
annual work program agreement detailing the products and services to be provided, and a
time-line for their delivery, while including flexibility to add and modify deliverables
during the year. Such services could include non-lending technical assistance as well as
studies. The Bank will agree with the Government on the pricing o f products, the
financing to be provided by each side, and determine what percentage o f the cost o f the
work program will be provided ex-ante and what percentage ex-post. Most important, the
arrangement will advance and support the strategic objectives o f the CPS.

82.
The analytical products can also leverage the capacity within the World Bank
Group. For example, IFC’s Advisory Services Department provides advisory assistance,
primarily to governments, o n private sector participation in infrastructure and other
public services, including concessions, privatizations, and public-private partnerships

33

(“PPPs”) in sectors such as power, transport, water, sanitation, health and education. I t s
services include transaction support, advice o n government policy and regulatory issues
(working with the World Bank), and structuring transactions in a way that maximizes
social and financial benefits for the client country while preserving necessary conditions
for attracting strong private sponsors.

Risks
Chile’s objective o f converging to OECD income levels i s ambitious and subject
to risks, albeit at reduced levels than in the past. The country’s strong record of
performance and the coherent development strategy o f the Government suggest that
progress will continue. Nevertheless, Chile does face risks which could slow the
convergence process. Successive governments have implemented policies to strengthen
social cohesion, reduce Chile’s macroeconomic vulnerability, and improve the policy
instruments available to respond to shocks. As a result, most o f the risks are currently
evaluated to be l o w or moderate. The following sections discuss each o f the main risks in
turn, including the risk to the Bank Group in responding to the challenge o f a new
partnership with Chile.

83.

Domestic Risks
84.
Political and social cohesion. M u c h o f Chile’s success over the past 15 years
can be attributed to a stable, consensual political environment and general social
cohesion. The protests by middle school students in mid-2006, the increase in labor
unrest in subsequent months, and the widespread dissatisfaction with the roll-out o f the
new urban transport system in Santiago in early 2007 reveal a society in transition.
Chileans who have lived with wealth inequities and limited public services are aware o f
the large fiscal surpluses and copper revenues and are demanding to see a rebalancing in
society.
Political tensions, including the weakening o f the cohesion within the
Concertacibn (the March 2007 cabinet shake-up i s an example), could lead to a slowing
o f the reform process and reduce trend growth. The Government i s responding to this
challenge with increasingly proactive social policies geared to broaden access to
opportunity for all classes o f society.
85.
Fiscal Pressures. Expectations are high that President Bachelet will use part o f
the copper windfall to fund new social programs. A major challenge will be to ensure the
fiscal sustainability o f the reform process and at the same time to meet societal
expectations in the years to come.

86.
Productivity and Competitiveness. Chile’s growth prospects are held back by
relatively slow productivity growth. Chile lags substantially behind O E C D economies
with respect to i t s innovation capacity, human capital, and labor force participation. The
country’s unique geography presents important challenges for infrastructure
development. W h i l e the Government’s agenda addresses all o f these issues, sustaining
high medium-term growth may prove more difficult than expected.

34

External Vulnerability

87.
The main risk factors for the economy are external, including a slowdown in
global markets, increased global risk aversion, and disruptions in the energy supply and
high o i l prices. Chile, a small open economy, remains sensitive to regional and global
developments and shifts in demand from i t s major trading partners. There i s a strong
association between GDP growth and external conditions. A slump in the market for
primary products such as copper, or an interruption in capital flows can substantially
reduce short-term growth. Out o f the last six major economic recessions in Chile, five
were precipitated by exogenous shocks. W h i l e Chile has been successful in reducing
exposure to financial contagion and diversifying i t s exports base, i t s economy remains
vulnerable to commodity price shocks and in particular to copper prices.
88.
Global slowdown combined with weak copper prices. Chile’s economy i s
highly reliant on copper. A sudden fall in prices would lead to a drop in output growth, a
weakening o f the currency and subdued capital flows. Debt indicators would likely
deteriorate and private sector profitability would decline. Mitigating factors include: the
strong liquidity positions o f the public and private sectors; their proven resilience in
previous slow growth episodes; and the potential for counter-cyclical policies provided
by the structural fiscal rule. The Government’s track record o f prudent policy
management, the strength o f public institutions, and the policy and regulatory framework
all indicate that a major crisis i s unlikely.
89.
Increased global risk aversion and/or an escalation o f regional instability.
Adverse international developments (possibly combined with a major crisis in the region)
that lead to heightened global risk aversion would have a negative impact given mainly
private sector financing needs. Chile has significant cushions to withstand such a shock.
In particular the corporate sector has shown resilience to similar shocks in the past and
leverage i s not high.
90.
Disruptions in the energy supply and further o i l price increases. Since 2004
Argentina has reduced i t s contractually agreed gas exports to Chile by at times up to 50
percent. Deeper cuts could materialize, but these risks are mitigated by the fact that
three-fourths o f Chilean f i r m s that use gas have already converted their plants to
alternative sources o f energy and new generation capacity i s coming o n stream.
The Risk to the World Bank Group

91.
M I C Strategy. Delivering on this strategy o f flexible, focused and fast support to
a sophisticated M I C l i k e Chile will put the Bank’s M I C strategy to the test. The Bank’s
technical expertise and advisory services will have to be cutting-edge, and responsive to
fast changing needs. I t will also have to establish financing arrangements-such as
reimbursable fee-for-service arrangements-which can facilitate timely negotiations and
rapid response. The Bank will need to manage the complex incentives emanating from
the twin objectives o f maintaining client demand for i t s knowledge services while

35

ensuring the highest standards in i t s analytical work with respect to quality and
objectivity.

With regard to the IFC, a challenge to the ability to deliver o n strategic focus
areas has been and may continue to be the high levels o f liquidity, generating at times
mispricing o f risks and preventing the materialization o f innovative structures, especially
in structured finance.
92.

VII. CONCLUSION
93.
Chile has a broad and ambitious development agenda. The CPS makes a limited,
well defined contribution. It presents an innovative way o f doing business to deliver justin-time knowledge services to a successful, globally integrated middle income country.
Maintaining flexibility in the financial and non-lending services will be critical to
meeting Chile’s emerging demands. Chile presents the Bank Group substantial
challenges and opportunities, and can be a model for other M I C s facing similar
challenges today and others in the future.

ANNEX 11: PROPOSED RESULTS FRAMEWORK FOR THE CHILE CPS
Introduction: As a results-based country strategy, the Chile CPS contains a strong
orientation toward achieving realistic outcomes and a results-oriented monitoring and
evaluation system. However, developing a results framework which specifies expected
linkages between the Bank’s interventions and long t e r m development goals for a flexible
program o f support such as described in the Chile CPS i s a challenge. This i s partly
because o f the relatively small scale o f the Bank’s financial support. The CPS envisions
modest IBRD lending, often to leverage Bank expertise in areas which the Government
has identified as a major priority and to which i t i s committing substantial resources (e.g.
innovation, tertiary education). I t is also because o f the nature o f the Bank’s evolving
role as a knowledge partner. The bulk o f the Bank’s support under the CPS will be AAA
and advisory services, the evaluation o f which presents inherent difficulties. This i s
especially true in Chile, where the Government i s requesting support o n a “real-time”
basis, and often for input to the policy process, in which the authorities are deciding from
multiple sources o f advice, and not, in every case, to the formulation or implementation
o f the policies themselves. This fluidity in demand, and the fact that the program will be

identification o f inputs and results difficult.

In this context, the CPS seeks to meet the core objective o f a results-based Country

results matrix will evaluate the investment projects supported by the Bank by their
specific project indicators and the overall portfolio performance.

I.

Country Development Results: The CPS i s based o n an explicit endorsement o f
the Government’s development vision and policy choices. A s such, it i s
reasonable to ask whether the Government i s achieving the goals it has clearly
established. The CPS includes under this first measurement a selected set o f goals
that the Government has indicated in the Development Program and other
The CPS has identified four country
speeches and public statements.
development goals that support the Government’s focus o n growth and equality o f
opportunity (Table A2.1). The goals have been chosen to be comprehensive in
scope and related to the areas o f emphasis for the Bank program (e.g., innovation,
education, social protection, etc.). At the end o f the CPS period, the Bank would
assess to what degree progress in each area will have been achieved.

11.

Evaluating the Bank’s Knowledge and Advisory Services. In this context, the
question is h o w effective the Bank i s in informing the policy process. Three
criteria will be used to measure the Bank’s contribution.

i)Quality:

0

0

The first level o f evaluation will be based o n feedback from the client. The
Bank will establish a periodic review with the Government and request i t s
assessment o f the engagement and the products delivered over the previous
cycle o f the joint studies program.
The Bank will seek evaluation o f a sample o f knowledge products from
outside experts, from Chile, the region, and globally.
The knowledge products will also be subject to the Bank’s internal evaluation
methods, including Q A G and peer reviews.

ii)Relevance:
0

In this context, one test will be whether the Government invites the Bank to
contribute to Chile’s high-priority policy issues. These are evident from the
Government’s Program and public statements.

41

0

A second measurement o f relevance will be whether the policies that the
Government pursues reflect the Bank’s advice. The Bank does not expect
directly attributable outcomes, but does believe that when the advice has been
useful (as has been the case with pension and education quality) the Bank’s
input will be evident in the resultingpolicy reform.

iii)Sustainability:
0

111.

The final way to ascertain the effectiveness o f the Bank’s advisory services i s
to see whether the Government’s demand continues. This was the case under
the 2002 CAS, during which the Government demanded the Bank’s AAA in a
level far in excess o f what was planned.

PROJECT RESULTS: Although lending i s expected to remain modest and the
proposed CPS program i s built around knowledge service and advice, the
Government continues to envisage a role o f the Bank in supporting
implementation o f key initiatives through investment operations. Each o f these
projects will be subject to standard Bank evaluation methodology.

At the individual project level, the Bank will track key results, including the
most important results indicators for each project (see examples o f Outcome
Indicators below). This will start with all ongoing projects and continue with
all new operations. For new projects, the Bank would add specific project
indicators to the table below, to be assessed at the end o f the CPS period.
Additionally, the Bank would emphasize for new projects that impact
evaluations be included in the project design wherever possible (see for
example the recent impact evaluation carried out for Chile Solidario by
Galasso (2006)).
At the portfolio level, only fully satisfactory performance will be acceptable
with respect to D O and IP.

ANNEX 111: ELEMENTS OF A FEE-FOR-SERVICE JOINT STUDIES
FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT

A key element o f the Chile CPS is to provide fast, flexible and focused support to a
country which has broad access to competing sources o f financing and ideas. Recent
experience demonstrates that Chile’s demand for Bank analytical services remains robust.
The requests for Bank analytical work during the 2002 CAS, which far exceeded the
number o f products scheduled, and the productive dialogue which has been developed
with the Bachelet Government, suggest that this demand i s likely to be sustained.
Successful fee-for-service products have recently been carried out in the areas o f
transport, the management o f contingent liabilities, and Chile’s monitoring and
evaluation system. New fee-for-service activities are now underway in the area o f public
administration, in support o f Chile’s Management Improvement Program, and in support
o f the financial sector in conjunction with the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening
Initiative (FIRST) initiative. As currently administered, each activity is negotiated on a
case-by-case basis, requiring substantial time and bureaucratic effort to be expended for
each product. This approach i s highly sub-optimal both with respect to the timeliness
with which the Bank can respond to requests and the planning o f the Bank and
Government o f their joint analytic agenda. A framework agreement can provide the
formal basis for this planning and help standardize procedures related to the pricing,
eligibility o f expenses and payment o f the products currently being negotiated on an
individual basis. Such an approach would yield a more streamlined, coherent foundation
on which to build a program o f activities.
Key Elements o f a Framework Agreement

The Bank has important experience in structuring fee-for-service framework
arrangements in Saudi Arabia and with the Gulf States, and recently with Kazakhstan,
countries which continue to demand Bank technical skills and analytical expertise.
Drawing on these experiences, the Bank and the Chilean authorities are discussing an
arrangement that would include a number o f elements o f these arrangements, perhaps the
most important o f which i s the ongoing dialogue that provides the basis for the
agreement. The Bank and the client would conduct an annual review o f programs,
studies and other ongoing products and think together about new studies the client might
request from the Bank. On the basis o f this review the client and the Bank would
establish, by mutual agreement and prior to the beginning o f each fiscal year, an annual
program with a related administrative budget. The review would, for example, specify
for each fiscal year:
0

The various programs, studies or other products to be undertaken or continued
during the year for which Bank support i s expected;
The estimated overall staffing requirements o f the Bank for this anticipated
support;

44

The rates at which the cost o f such assistance shall be reimbursed by the
Government to the Bank, including overhead for the Bank’s personnel and
physical infrastructure;
The modality o f financing. The existing fee-for-service framework programs
have operated on a reimbursable basis, at the rates specified in the annual
agreements, and in accordance with the Bank’s normal budgeting procedures.
However, increased consideration i s being given to prepayment by the client o f
part or all o f the projected annual work program costs. There are important
reasons for this. Prepayment can help facilitate:
o Cross-FY Costs: prepayment would help find work-in-progress that crosses
fiscal years (which the Bank’s budgeting system may not easily
accommodate);
o Country Commitment: it would signal a measure o f country commitment
which will allow, inter alia, the Bank to commit key staff and other resources
in advance to meet the projected work program.
The planning benefits that accrue from a fee-for-service framework agreement do not
come at the cost o f flexibility. In fact, at any time during the course o f each year, the
Bank and the authorities would be free to exchange views on the progress o f the program
and the administrative budget o f the year and, by mutual agreement, modify the program
as both sides determine appropriate.

Most important, work carried out under a framework agreement with Chile will be f i l l y
consistent with the CPS and underpinned by fill adherence to the Bank’s procedures.
They would also benefit from the Bank’s network o f internal services and external
partners.
The products will benefit from concept reviews to assure that the activity design
meets agreed country priorities, as well as mid-term and final reviews to assure
that the final outputs meet the requirements o f the framework agreement and
Bank best practice, including those o f corporate quality assurance processes
(QAG).
The Bank will also support the full analytical agenda with i t s dissemination and
communication capacities to ensure the highest possible level o f impact and
ownership. This includes support with seminars, book/study launches, press
outreach and workshops.
The work program will benefit from the Bank’s ability to harness the
contributions o f the entire Bank Group, including the IFC, MIGA and WBI.
Finally, the Bank has a global network o f partners in the policy, private sector and
academic communities, which, with a longer term planning horizon, can be more
effectively brought to bear to programmed studies.
IFC Advisory Services

The analytical products can also leverage the capacity within the World Bank Group. The
IFC’s Advisory Services Department provides advisory assistance, primarily to

45

governments, o n private sector participation in infrastructure and other public services,
including concessions, privatizations, and Public-Private Partnerships (or “PPPs”). The
department i s concerned primarily with expanding access to and improving the quality
and sustainability o f public services in sectors such as power, transport, water, sanitation,
health and education. To achieve this goal, the IFC provides a full range o f services,
including transaction support, advice o n government policy and regulatory issues
(working with the World Bank), and structuring o f transactions in a way that maximizes
social and financial benefits for the client country while preserving necessary conditions
for attracting strong private sponsors. The department’s primary strengths include i t s
ability to design and implement complex transactions in developing markets, and bring
best practices from over 100 projects in 67 countries to each transaction.

Mr. Paul U’otfoilyitz;

Dcar Mr. Wolfowitz

f am pleased to addrcss you on bchalf o f the Government o f the Republic o f Chile
to welcome the productive relationship we have cnjoycd with the World Bank Group and,
in particular, to endorse the Country Farmership Strategy for 2007-20IO. We have had
an exceffent consultative process and we in the Government believe that the CPS reflects
a shared undcrstmding o f Chile’s development vision.
IJnder the leadership o f Prcsident MichcIIe Bachelet, the Government has t e n
implementing a development program based on the twin goals o f strong economic growth
and equality o f opportunity for a11 Chileans. The program builds upon Chile’s significant
achievements since thc return o f democracy in 1990 and recommits the country to a
future o f greater equity and social inctusion. A s you h a w 3Chile has recorded nearly
two decades o f robust economic growth and substmtial social progress. including
reducing poverty by more than one-half. Chile ha.$ pursucd outward oriented trade and
commercial policies, a prudent fiscal position and strong, transparent public institutions,
while at the same time investing in proactive social programs aimed at reducing the
impact o f incornc and health related shacks, and providing old age security. ‘E’he Program
wc are advancing today seeks to build on this approach to ensure that Chile complctcs its
transformation to a modern, competitive, inclusive country.

The President has identified particular areas o f emphasis to advance this program,
including reforming the pension system, enhmcing the quality o f education, meeting the
challenge of innovation and competitiveness, and ensuring adequate infrastructure
resources and their management. We believe the CPS identifies a program of caefuully
targeted support to OUF Government’s development program, and leverages the Bank
Group‘s specific areas o f comparative advantage to addrcss key development challenges.

48

We arc grateful for thc productive dialogue we have shared with thc Barrk Group,
and believe the CPS reflects the aspirations and objectives delineated in thc

As was the ease under the 2002 CAS, we k l i e v c the Bank Group has a great deal to offer
with respect to i t s global bowledge and sector expertise in ~t range of‘ meus, which we
hope to festerage. We also look forward to the continued active presence of the IEC,
particularly in high impact anas where there i s strong potential for demonstration eRect,

The Government welcomes the highly flexible nature o f the CPS m d the mix o f
instruments identified to deliver support. We believe that the Bank i s of the greatest
assiscmcc to Chile when it provides knowledge services on a flexible, fast, ‘*just-in-time’B
basis. In rhis context, we are pleased to be moving forward with the formal ESW on the
lupment Stratcgy for thc northernmost regions and with the work on
QuaIity Assurance for Education, We are in productive discussion on possible future
studies in other areas.

’I’he Government’s interest in the Bank’s analytical products i s evident from our
experience during the previous CAS, during whjcfi time ow: demand for knowledge

In addition, while the interventions idcntified and contemplatedunder the CPS are
composed primarily of howfedge products. we do expect to draw on the Bank‘s project
support. Wc have idenxidied four loans to date and took forward to continued ciose
engagement with an eye toward identifying potential new projccts as we move forward

Summary
T h i s document contains an evaluation o f CAS objectives in Chile together with the respective contributions
of the Government and the Bank.
When the 2002 CAS was being prepared, Chile was exceptional within the LAC region in that, as a middle
income country with a strong external financial position, it had no need to borrow from the Bank for
purposes of resource transfer. On the other hand, Chile i s an open society that i s very receptive to ideas
from abroad and clearly wishes to forge strong ties with the international community at large. In that
respect, the Bank has been a facilitator of communication that can foster the transfer of knowledge and
experience. The 2002 CAS was prepared with that objective in mind and within the framework of the
Bank’s agenda for Middle Income Countries.
In 2002, Chile had s t i l l not fully recovered from the external shocks precipitated by the successive crises of
the late nineties in East Asia, Russia and Brazil. The East Asian crisis of 1997 was potentially much more
damaging to Chile than to most other LAC countries because a substantial share o f exports went to the
countries in crisis. A first priority of the government was to consolidate the economic recovery and set
Chile back on a path of sustained growth. The CAS aimed to support the government in that endeavor.
Chile managed to emerge from the crisis better than most other LAC countries due, in large part, to a steady
and purposeful program o f structural reform that had been put in place since the 1970s and that had resulted
in a strong institutional framework, sound fiscal fundamentals, prudent monetary policies, far-reaching
integration into the global economy and a solid and deep financial sector. Growth accelerated from 2-3
percent at the beginning of the CAS period to above 6 percent in each of 2004 and 2005. Hence the CAS
country goal o f 5 percent growth was comfortably met. Other macroeconomic indicators also demonstrate a
very good overall performance.

T h e CAS envisaged a modest Bank lending program of US600 million designed to maximize the
effectiveness o f Bank support and focusing selectively on areas where the Bank could draw upon a broad
international experience to assist the government advance i ts development agenda. Actual lending
amounted to US445 million, the difference due principally to a Watershed Management Project that was
dropped at the request o f the Government. T h e rest of the program was effectively delivered with minor
adjustments to accommodate changing country needs. T h e IFC had a strong presence in Chile throughout
the CAS period focusing on high impact areas with commitments o f US$364 million including US$148
million for syndications through the B-loan program. Global programs such as GEF, the Carbon Fund
Prototype and the Montreal Protocol were also successfully mobilized to finance projects o f environmental
significance.
The program o f AAA was particularly well tailored to the needs o f Chile in the period FY02-06 and went
far beyond the one major analysis per year envisaged in the CAS. A total o f eighteen studies were delivered
at the request o f the client during the CAS period including two undertaken on a fee-for-service basis.
Without exception these studies were well received by the client who requested additional follow-up work
in many cases. T h e program o f AAA formed the backbone o f a fruitful ongoing policy dialogue which has
focused on a wide range of issues. I t has often been delivered in parallel with technical assistance, both
formal and informal, including advice on the design o f health insurance, the delivery of rural infrastructure
services and issues o f environmental protection amongst many others. T h e Chilean authorities have, in
many instances, explicitly acknowledged the contribution o f the Bank AAA to policy reform.
From an overall perspective the 2002 CAS effectively provided the context for a successful collaboration
between the Bank and Chile as the country consolidated i ts economic recovery and reestablished sustained
growth along with effective progress towards greater equity. T h e Bank and Chile are now well placed to
move forward with a broad policy dialogue backed by selective lending operations strategically targeted at
areas where the Bank can contribute most effectively to the medium-term goal o f convergence with the
OECD economies.

Part A: Long-Term Strategic Goals
Introduction: The Bank’s M I C agenda

1.
The 2002 Chile CAS was prepared at a time when the Bank had recently reviewed
and reassessed i t s strategy o f support for middle income countries (MICs). A paper
entitled “Supporting Country Development: Strengthening the World Bank Group ’s
Support for Middle Income Countries ” was discussed at a meeting o f Executive Directors
in March 2001 and then considered by the Development Committee the following month.
The Chile CAS was based upon the strategic design proposed in the paper which had
received support from both the Executive Directors and the Development Committee.
The implementation o f the CAS, therefore, provides an informative case study o f how the
M I C agenda o f the Bank was applied in practice. The overall outcome has been both
positive and encouraging.

2.
The new Bank strategy o f support for M I C s came at a propitious moment when
the operational relationship between the Bank and Chile was itself undergoing a
~
strong external finance position had
transformation. Whereas, during the 1 9 9 0 ~Chile’s
resulted in a significant reduction o f Bank assistance, the Lagos administration which
came to office at the turn o f the new century showed an active interest in reviving the
level o f cooperation with the Bank, particularly in terms o f forging a strategic partnership
that could help with the design o f innovative programs for the achievement o f growth
with equity. At the same time, the Bank was seen as a prospective source o f contingent
finance in the event o f a global or regional crisis and new lending instruments such as the
Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) appeared to offer Chile additional modalities o f risk
management. Hence there was a harmony o f views between Chile and the Bank that
provided a favorable context for expanding the scope o f collaboration.
3.
Box 1 below i s taken directly from the Bank’s 2001 paper on MICs. It
summarizes the main proposals o f a task force whose work formed the basis o f the paper.
In keeping with the task force proposals, the Chile CAS based i t s lending and nonlending support on the development priorities and the strategic vision articulated by the
country itself. Particular attention was given to a selected number o f new government
initiatives o f the Lagos administration where the Bank was well placed to contribute by
virtue o f i t s broad international experience. Those programs included (i)
Chile Solidario,
a newly adopted approach to social protection; (ii)
TRANSANTIAGO, an ambitious plan
to improve transport and air quality in the capital city; (iii)
Chile CaZlJica, a program for
lifelong learning; and (iv) Government efforts to foster science, technology and
innovation. Each o f those initiatives i s addressed in detail in sections below.
4.
The modalities o f Bank Group support were also consistent with the task force
proposals. The program o f AAA and technical assistance set out in the CAS to help Chile
identify and implement development policies and build capacity included fiduciary
assessments and other diagnostic analytic work carried out with the client and with other
development partners including the IDB. The client response was very positive and the
demand for additional analytic work was much greater than envisaged in the CAS.

52

Specific outcomes are reviewed and assessed below in the sections that correspond to
work performed. I t i s noteworthy that an independent review o f the Chile country
program o f AAA by an internal Bank QAG panel concluded that many o f the tasks
undertaken were conceptually innovative in policy design and program implementation,
generating a high degree o f client satisfaction.
Box 1: Summary o f proposals for strengthening World Bank Group support for the M I C
Strengthen the Country Assistance Strategy as the key vehicle for agreeing o n a focused program o f
W o r l d Bank Group lending and nonlending support, based o n the country‘s development vision and
priorities, a systematic and comprehensive diagnosis, and an informed view o f support that i s o r can be
provided by others.
Encourage countries to present their vision of development as a basis for support from all development
partners and the starting point for the Bank‘s CAS. Encourage countries to set out this vision in the f o r m o f
a Letter o f Development Strategy.
Rebuild and systematize the Bank‘s economic and sector work. This i s needed if the Bank i s t o be
effective in helping countries identify and implement development priorities and build capacity. The C A S
should set out a program o f ESW, including development policy reviews, fiduciary assessments, and other
diagnostic E S W carried out wherever possible with clients and other development partners.
Develop lendingproducts that match the needs of middle-income countries. Investment lending can be a
powerful vehicle for transferring knowledge and testing n e w approaches and can be linked t o reform
programs through the CAS. But in many cases policy-based programmatic lending in support o f mediumterm reform programs, synchronized with national budget cycles, provides more effective assistance, and
i t s use i s likely to expand where there i s sufficiently strong country fiduciary and public expenditure
management capacity. Programmatic structural adjustment loans might be renamed development support
loans to better reflect their core purpose in supporting development. A n e w deferred drawdown option i s
proposed for use with policy-based loans. This would meet the needs o f countries that are currently able to
borrow f r o m the market, but are anxious both to remain more continuously engaged with the Bank and t o
enhance their debt management flexibility. I t w o u l d also help countries that wish to remain engaged with
the Bank but for the time being do not need t o borrow f r o m the Bank, although they are at a stage o f
development when experience suggests they m a y need support again in the future.
Use these enhancements and improvedprocesses to reduce the cost of doing business with the Bank and
as a basis for greater country and institutional selectivity. Tfie improved and more systematic policy
dialogue will help countries focus o n key policy priorities, and, combined with a streamlining o f Bank
internal processes, will help reduce the costs o f doing business with the Bank. I t will also allow the B a n k to
cooperate more effectively with other multilateral development banks (MDBs) and other development
partners (and better exploit synergies within the Bank Group), exercising greater selectivity at the country

level about which o f the priorities for each country the Bank itself should support. Other areas for enhanced
institutional cooperation with other MDBs should also be explored, starting with fiduciary assessments,
where there are shared institutional needs.
Strengthen collaboration with the IMF. The improved processes and strengthened analytical and
diagnostic work will help the Bank to better advise countries o n social, structural, and sectoral policies and
institutions, paralleling and complementing the w o r k o f the IMF o n macroeconomic policies and related
structural policies and institutions. They should support more structured and streamlined Bank-Fund
cooperation in the policy dialogue with middle-income countries, along the lines o f the enhanced
framework being developed for low-income countries.

5.
In addition, and also following the recommendations o f the M I C task force,
lending products were developed to match the perceived needs o f Chile consistent with
i t s strong country fiduciary and public expenditure management capacity. Policy-based
programmatic lending in support o f a medium-term reform program was used to finance
a Santiago urban transport project in support o f the TRANSANTIAGO initiative and, at the
request o f the government, the newly introduced deferred drawdown option (DDO) was
used to finance a Social Protection SAL. Although the DDO did not enhance the
financial management flexibility o f Chile in the manner anticipated, the projects and
programs supported by these loans were implemented successfully as detailed in the
sector sections that follow.

6.

Implementation o f the CAS was particularly successful in establishing an
effective working relationship with the country in many areas o f reform including health,
education, environmental protection and social protection. In many cases, the Bank
worked alongside other international financial institutions as recommended by the task
force. The sector sections o f this completion report provide details o f the close
consultation and collaboration between Bank staff and government agencies in the
development o f programs such as Chile Solidurio for social protection and Chile C u l z ~ c u
for a program o f life-long learning. In addition there was enhanced institutional
cooperation with other international financial institutions, not only in the area o f fiduciary
assessments where there are shared institutional needs, but also in other areas such as a
gender assessment done jointly with the IDB and a financial sector assessment done
jointly with the IMF. Those achievements are also examined in more detail in the
corresponding sections that follow.

The Government’s program

7.
When the 2002 CAS was being prepared, Chile had s t i l l not fully recovered from
the external shocks precipitated by the successive crises o f the late nineties in East Asia,
Russia and Brazil. The East Asian crisis o f 1997 was potentially much more damaging to
Chile than to most other L A C countries because a substantial share o f exports went to the
countries in crisis. There was a sudden stop in capital flows to Chile and, a result, annual
growth in GDP per capita slowed to an average o f only 1.3 percent in the years 19982003 - far below the performance o f Chile in the previous ten years. Nevertheless, Chile
managed to emerge from the crisis better than most other L A C countries due, in large
part, to a steady and purposeful program o f structural reform that had been put in place
since the 1970s and that had resulted in a strong institutional framework, sound fiscal
fundamentals, prudent monetary policies, far-reaching integration into the global
economy and a solid and deep financial sector.
8.
Although the government did not present to the Bank i t s vision o f development in
the form o f a letter o f development strategy, i t clearly articulated i t s vision and i t s
strategy in other contexts. When President Lagos assumed office, he outlined the program
o f his coming six-year administration in an inaugural speech to Congress o n M a y 21,
2000. A central objective was to revitalize efforts towards poverty reduction which had
been slowed although not stalled by the economic crises o f the late nineties. To secure

54

the enabling environment for further poverty reduction, his immediate goal was to
consolidate the economic recovery and set Chile once more o n a path o f sustained growth
in the order o f 6-7 percent per annum. In that context he pledged a commitment to strong
monetary and fiscal policies, including a structural fiscal surplus equivalent to 1 percent
H e also recognized the importance o f enhancing global
o f GDP o n average.
competitiveness by addressing issues o f information technology, communications,
research and innovation in Chile.

9.

In parallel with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the government sought to
continue with reforms that would improve the delivery o f social services and make the
pursuit o f economic progress more inclusive. With respect to health, the government was
to introduce comprehensive legislation that would restructure the sector and place i t on a
sound financial footing. In education, the government focused explicitly o n upgrading
secondary schooling to eliminate dropouts by the year 2010. In addition, i t envisaged a
major expansion o f preschool facilities both to improve school performance in later years
and to help more women j o i n the labor force.

A third objective was to enhance the efficiency o f government by improving
management systems, forging closer l i n k s with the private sector and increasing
transparency and accountability. Decentralization was seen as an important part o f that
endeavor and, to that end, the government aimed that, by 2006, at least h a l f o f the public
investment program should be decided and managed at the regional level.
10.

In tackling this ambitious agenda, the Lagos administration made i t clear that they
11,
would seek new ideas and innovative approaches because there was a perception that
traditional practices had exhausted their potential. In particular, a high priority was
attached to the design o f social programs that would deal proactively with the issues o f
social inclusion, drawing upon the experience and best practice o f other countries where
applicable. In that context they sought an active collaboration with the Bank as well as
other international organizations.

The Bank's program o f support
12.
A central objective o f the 2002 CAS was to seize the opportunity o f the moment
to design a program o f Bank assistance that, while modest in size, was strategically
focused o n cutting-edge, high priority initiatives where the Bank could draw upon i t s
international knowledge and experience and play a catalytic role in working across
traditional sector boundaries.
13.
The program proposed in the 2002 CAS was broadly supportive o f the
government's program and i t envisaged three pillars o f Bank support corresponding to
the stated development objectives o f the government. A m i x o f investment lending and
adjustment lending was contemplated, making use o f the newly introduced D D O lending
instrument for purposes o f r i s k management. At the same time there was to be an active
program o f eco'nomic and sector work focused selectively o n areas that offered the
prospect o f fruitful collaboration between the Bank and the government.

55

14.

Sustaining economic growth and social progress was the first pillar o f Bank
support. This i s an area in which Chile had already established a good track record o f
sustained economic growth and poverty reduction which was only temporarily
interrupted by the East Asian and Russian crises o f 1997-98. The CAS aimed at
supporting government efforts to further diversify the economy, adopt new technologies
and enhance competitiveness. In that context there was to be a sharp focus o n R&D
management, further improvements to the education system and greater participation o f
women in the labor force.

15.
Inclusion was the second pillar o f Bank support. Building upon a solid record o f
achievement in the 1990s when Chile greatly expanded access to social services, the CAS
was supportive o f government efforts to further improve the quality and coverage o f
those services. A special emphasis was placed upon reducing regional disparities in basic
infrastructure particularly with respect to rural communities.
16.
Modernization o f the State was a third pillar o f Bank support. Chile ranks high
in terms o f the institutional capability o f its public service. Other indicators o f
governance such as probity and judicial security are also favorable. The CAS sought to
support government efforts to increase s t i l l further the efficiency and effectiveness o f i t s
public service through the development o f modern, integrated management systems and
to strive for equal access to services throughout the country.
In that context,
decentralization and the strengthening o f capabilities at the municipal and regional levels
was a prominent focus.
Instruments o f Bank Group support

17.
Notwithstanding the ripple effects o f the East Asian, Russian and Argentine
crises, Chile was able to withstand the shock better than most other L A C countries and
the overall financial position o f the country remained sound. Furthermore, the countercyclical policy o f the Government was structured in such a way as to imply a progressive
reduction in the ratio o f debt to GDP. Hence, resource transfer was not a major objective
o f the Bank program. Instead, the choice o f instruments was designed to maximize the
effectiveness o f Bank support focusing selectively o n areas where the Bank could draw
upon a broad international experience to assist the government to advance i t s
development agenda.

18.
The CAS envisaged a base case lending program in the range o f about US$600
m i l l i o n for the period FY02-05. In broad terms the program was to be divided equally
between investment lending and adjustment lending. In the latter case, the newly
introduced Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) was proposed as an appropriate
instrument for enhancing the risk management capability o f Chile in the context o f an
unsettled global environment. I t was also anticipated that the I F C would have an active
role in helping the private sector respond to global and regional uncertainties. I t was
further envisaged that Chile would continue to make use o f GEF and Montreal Protocol
financing for projects addressing global environmental issues.

Part B: CAS Outcomes

The 2002 CAS was results based. Specific country performance indicators were

specified in a Program Matrix as well as “self-evaluation indicators” for the CAS. Many
o f the country performance indicators were expressed in quantitative terms that can be

always quantitative, were generally quite specific and can be readily compared with
actual outcomes in most cases. The CAS Program Matrix is duplicated in Attachment 1
along with actual outcomes. In addition to the Program Matrix, the CAS included a text
table (Table 8) which identified a smaller number o f more specific performance
indicators. That table i s duplicated in Attachment 2 along with actual outcomes.
Pillar 1: Sustaining Economic Growth and Social Progress
Overview

20.
Recent Chilean administrations have attached high priority to social progress both
in alleviating poverty and improving the quality o f l i f e for the population at large. When
the last CAS was under preparation in 2001, i t was clearly understood that social progress
would only be possible if the incipient recovery from the recession o f 1999-2000 were to
be consolidated and growth reestablished on a sustained basis. That, in turn, would
require concerted action on many fronts. Hence, the first CAS pillar was multi-faceted
and the CAS objectives were similarly diverse. The broad outcomes are summarized
below. Details are to be found in Attachment 1.
21.
Country outcomes were very good. Inthe course o f the CAS, Chile successfully
consolidated i t s recovery from the shocks o f the late nineties and, by the end o f the
period, had reestablished rates o f growth in the range o f 6 percent. The first two years of
the CAS period, 2002 and 2003, witnessed a continued transition to full recovery made
possible by a general public consensus concerning the need for disciplined fiscal and
monetary policies. That enabled the government to focus on further reforms to modernize
the state, make markets more efficient and streamline the regulatory framework while, at
the same time, increasing the equity and efficiency o f social programs.
CAS outcomes in the period 2002-05 were also positive in terms o f government
22.
action although the results o f that action f e l l short o f targets in some cases. In education,
for example, the government made good progress in the more equitable distribution o f
resources, especially to private technical schools and students from poor families. As a
result school enrollment increased substantially. However, an increase in the number o f
schoolchildren from poor families with little or no tradition o f education made it difficult
for Chile to attain higher average international education scores as targeted in the
program matrix under pillar I.Similarly, there was considerable progress in advancing
the institutional basis for gender equality but this has not resulted in greater participation
by women in the labor force. Above all, strong and sustained growth was not
accompanied by an improvement in the distribution o f income which remains among the
most unequal in the world. I t would appear that the time needed for institutional reforms

57

to work their way through the system and create more equitable socio-economic
outcomes was underestimated in the CAS.
23.
In terms o f Bank activities in support o f the government's agenda for sustained
economic growth and social progress, the program o f AAA envisaged in the CAS was
amply fulfilled and well received. The outcome o f the lending program presents a more
complex picture. Four o f the five projects contemplated in the CAS for this pillar were
effectively delivered (see Attachment 5). In dollar terms, however, total lending was
much less than programmed mainly because a large watershed management project was
dropped at the request o f the Government. In addition, a Santiago Urban Transport SAL
was structured as a two-phased programmatic DPL and only the first phase was approved
and disbursed in the CAS period. Nevertheless, the dollar shortfall is not o f great
significance because Chile has a strong external financial position and resource transfer
was not an objective o f the CAS. With the exception o f the watershed management
project, the development objectives o f the CAS lending program were fulfilled and a
tertiary education project, not explicitly included in the CAS was successfully added.
Macroeconomic performance and public sector management

24.
A s a result o f a successful economic recovery, and helped by higher prices for
copper exports, growth accelerated from 2-3 percent at the beginning o f the CAS period
to above 6 percent in each o f 2004 and 2005. Hence the CAS country goal o f 5 percent
growth was met notwithstanding an estimated slowdown in 2006.
Similarly,
unemployment, which stood at 7.6 percent in September/October 2006, i s below the 10
percent ceiling specified in the CAS. Outcomes with respect to poverty are more difficult
to determine because the latest data available i s drawn from a household survey o f 2003
when the official headcount o f poverty stood at 18.8 percent. A new household survey
was held in 2006 but results are not yet available. However, GDP growth has been strong
in recent years and, when the next official data becomes available in 2007, it i s likely to
show that poverty has fallen below the 17 percent target ceiling identified in the CAS.
Bank staff estimates suggest that urban poverty rates likely fell to 14.5 percent by end2006. Macroeconomic indicators demonstrate a very good overall performance (see
Table 1 below).

25.
Fiscal discipline has been a key factor underpinning the strong macroeconomic
performance in Chile. The Bank, jointly with the IDB undertook a country financial
accountability assessment (CFAA) in FY05 which concluded that a second generation o f
public sector reforms i s bearing fruit because i t rests on a solid existing base o f fiscal
stability, predictable financing and resource utilization consistent with budget
authorizations. Similarly, a country procurement assessment report (CPAR), published in
August 2004, concluded that Chile has adopted a well thought-out and comprehensive
strategy and action plan for the procurement o f goods and services that i s an example o f
best practice. The strength o f the strategy i s that i t openly recognizes existing
shortcomings, builds upon past experience and enjoys ownership at the highest levels o f
government. At the same time, the team responsible for implementation i s committed
and competent. The recommendations o f the CPAR for strengthening the procurement
system were welcomed by the Undersecretary o f Finance who said that the Bank’s views
would be a considerable contribution to the reform process. In the sixth meeting o f the
Latin American Corporate Governance Roundtable (sponsored jointly by the Bank, the
I F C and the OECD) which was held in Lima, Peru during September 2005, the Chilean
delegation reported that “Currently, Chile i s in the process o f adopting International
Financial Reporting Standards for listed companies. This project is a direct follow-up to
the Accounting and Auditing ROSC.”
26.
The strategy articulated in the CAS for attaining sustained economic growth and
social progress went far beyond sound macroeconomic management which was, in itself,
seen as a necessary but not sufficient requirement. During the period 2002-06 covered by
the CAS, the Bank contributed to the policy dialogue on economic growth and social
progress with two major pieces o f analytic work. The first, a study o f the “New
Economy”, focused on the role o f knowledge as a critical factor for competitiveness and
growth. I t examined the incentive framework for innovation as well as options for
fostering the development o f science and technology. Special attention was given to
information and communication technology which constitutes the infrastructure o f the
knowledge economy. The second study, a “Development Policy Review” (DPR) was
broader in scope. I t analyzed the prospects for convergence between the economy o f
Chile and other OECD countries which has been a goal o f successive administrations. I t
also selectively addressed a number o f issues that have a direct bearing upon convergence
such as innovation, education, social protection, development finance and reducing the
vulnerability o f Chile to external shocks. Within those broad rubrics, the DPR was
significant in that i t embraced themes that had become increasingly prominent in the
public forum including income distribution, pre-school education and the anti-cyclical
role o f fiscal policy. The DPR also facilitated the preparation o f Policy Notes and both
were delivered to the government o f President Bachelet who took office in March 2006.
A continuation o f the policy dialogue was thereby assured.

59

Box 2: Policy Notes on issues of priority for the incoming administration
In 2006 the Bank submitted to the incoming administration o f President Bachelet policy notes o n issues o f
importance to the Government. In contrast t o policy notes that were prepared in some other countries, the
Chile policy notes were n o t a voluminous overview o f development issues facing the country. Instead they
focused selectively o n five areas identified by the Government as high priority and they sought to identify
the principal strategic policy options in a short few pages. The brevity and sharpness o f focus o f the policy
notes helped t o advance the country dialogue.

Improving access and quality o f early childhood
The five topics covered by the policy notes were (i)
education, (ii)
Better policies for old-age income support, (iii)
Health reform, (iv) Regulation o f basic
public services and (v) Regional development and decentralization. Shortly afterwards President Bachelet,
upon assuming office, set up commissions to h o l d public hearings and make recommendations for
government action and policy reform in the two areas o f pension reform and early childhood development.
B o t h o f the commissions met with Bank staff and requested the Bank to prepare briefs in addition t o the
policy notes focusing, in particular, upon the experience o f other countries.
With respect to pension reform, the policy note o n o l d age income support summarized a deeper and more
comprehensive analysis submitted to the government separately as part o f a Development Policy Review.
Using those submissions as a point o f departure, Bank staff were invited to attend the public hearings o f the
commission o n pension reform and respond to questions. In addition, B a n k staff, along with
representatives f r o m the IDB and OECD, participated in a three-day seminar and workshop sponsored by
the commission which focused, in particular, o n international experience with pension reform.

The commission o n early childhood development requested the Bank t o prepare a further b r i e f in addition
to the policy note o n access and quality o f early childhood education and t o focus the b r i e f o n international
experience with respect t o five specific questions. Bank staff were also invited to Chile t o discuss the brief
with members o f the commission. The Bank b r i e f was posted o n the website o f the commission as a k e y
background document to the commission’s final report
B o t h o f the additional Bank briefs were w e l l received by the commissions concerned and the final reports
o f the commissions, published in mid-2006, drew upon the material contained in the Bank’s analysis.

27.
The Bank also provided operational support for fiscal management. A loan for a
Public Expenditure Management Project in the amount o f US$23.23 million was
approved in February 2002. The objective o f the project was to address challenges o f
public expenditure management in a comprehensive manner. I t aimed to establish a
modem information management system in the central government and public agencies
that would allow for operational decentralization within a framework o f normative
centralization. I t also aimed at budget reform through a medium-term expenditure
framework with multi-annual financial planning and a focus o n results oriented
budgeting. Another objective was to upgrade civil service management information
systems to enable a future linkage with performance evaluation and agency budget
results. A fourth objective was to strengthen the institutional capacity o f line agencies in
the areas o f financial and human resource management. The operation complemented
assistance furnished by the IDB for modernization o f the Contraloria and i t represents an
example o f successful collaboration between the Bank and the IDB.
28.
Progress in public management has been very good and the Government has
expressed interest in continued Bank support with a follow-up project. Project

60

implementation status reports indicate that, as o f January 2006, the integrated financial
management system (SIGFE) developed under the project had been adopted by 349 out
o f a total o f 389 public sector agencies including 192 hospitals. Standards have been
defined whereby agencies structure their financial information within SIGFE and there
were 6600 registered users o f the system in December 2005. D e s i g n o f the interface
between SIGFE and Chile Compras (an on-line information system for public sector
procurement) has been completed and i s now being implemented. At the same time, good
progress is being made with reforming the budget system. A results-oriented budget
system has been introduced and technical specifications are being designed to link the
results-based system to SIGFE. However, the project component that aims to establish
an information system for public sector personnel management (SIAPER) has been
slower in moving forward. A new civil service law o f 2004 added impetus to the
endeavor and i t i s n o w estimated that the design o f SIAPER will soon be ready.
29.
Closely related to public expenditure management were advisory services
furnished by the Bank to the government on the management o f contingent liabilities
particularly with respect to road concessions. In order to attract private capital to finance
transport infrastructure the government has, for many years, negotiated concession
contracts which transferred most o f the risks associated with road finance from the
government to the private sector. The concession agreements customarily include
government guarantees with respect to minimum revenue for the concessionaire and a
foreign exchange guarantee. The recession o f 1999-2000 raised concerns that some o f
these guarantees may be called (although, in the event, none were) and the government
invited the Bank to help assess its contingent liability more explicitly. In a first phase o f
technical assistance (provided on a fee-for-service basis) the Bank helped develop a
model to assess the potential cost o f guarantees and options for managing them. The
model i s being implemented in a second phase o f technical assistance and the annual
budget o f Chile now includes an annex on contingent liabilities. The Bank was well
placed to undertake this work because o f i t s long operational experience in the road
sector together with i t s broad international experience in issues o f financial management.
The experience demonstrates how Bank AAA can be put to practical use and
incorporated into a monitoring system which is continuously operational.
Bank support for private sector development

30.
Bank Group support for private sector development in Chile has been twofold.
The Bank has undertaken analytic work on policy and regulatory issues while the I F C has
had an active operational engagement. MIGA was not active in Chile during the CAS
period because investors judged the political risk to be minimal and the private insurance
market was able to provide coverage where required at competitive prices.
31.
In May 2004 the Bank delivered to the government a draft study entitled “A
Strategy to Promote Innovative Small and Medium Enterprises”. The study put forward
specific recommendations for streamlining the multiplicity o f government programs that
are intended to assist SMEs. The study found the programs to be poorly coordinated.
They were based on traditional approaches that too often supply resources to keep

61

companies running that may otherwise f a i l instead o f offering them incentives and
technical support to transform themselves. The study proposed a results-based tracking
system for all S M E programs, and recommended that the l i n k s between Chile’s national
innovation system and the private sector be strengthened.
32.
The draft was received with interest and the government asked that additional
analytic work be undertaken before it was finalized. A revised and expanded study was
delivered to the new administration o f President Bachelet in April 2006. The additional
time needed to satisfy the government’s interest was well spent in that i t permitted a
deeper and more fi-uitful sector dialogue. Already in 2005, before the study was
concluded, the government had issued an important policy paper on technology and
innovation which incorporated a number o f the recommendations o f the Bank study,
notably an initiative to establish an integrated information system to follow the progress
o f SMEs as well as measures to reward innovation.
The study o f SMEs fitted in with a broader program o f analytic work and
33.
technical assistance on private sector development. In FY06 the Bank delivered to the
government an “Investment Climate Assessment” based on a survey covering 1,000 f i r m s
and focusing on the microeconomic and structural dimensions o f Chile’s business
environment, viewed from an international perspective. The overall finding was that
Chile compares favorably with other countries in which the Bank has completed similar
assessments. Nevertheless, weaknesses were revealed in the investment climate that
reinforced the analysis and recommendations o f other studies including the Development
Policy Review and Policy Notes. In particular, technology, innovation and labor skills
again emerged as key areas in need o f further attention., thereby further supporting
ongoing government initiatives in that direction.

Mindful that private sector development and, indeed, the broader macroeconomic
34.
perspective are critically dependent upon a well-hnctioning financial sector, the
government requested the Bank to undertake a study within the framework o f the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The financial sector assessment was
undertaken by a team that included, in addition to staff from the Bank and the Fund,
representatives from the Bank o f Spain, the Bank o f England, the Bank o f Israel, the
European Central Bank and the U S Securities Exchange Commission. Their report, dated
August 2004, acknowledged that the financial system in Chile i s large, w e l l diversified,
sound overall and resilient to shocks. I t nevertheless came forward with numerous
recommendations to strengthen the system including the Central Bank, commercial
banks, corporate finance, insurance companies, pension funds and the securities market.
The recommendations were well received by the Chilean authorities who evidently
viewed the Bank as a useful interlocutor. In the absence o f financial sector lending, i t
was not easy for the Bank to follow up, but funding has been secured from FIRST (a
multi-donor facility established to support financial sector development in low- and
middle-income countries) for the finance o f consultants that are advising the authorities
as they move forward with pension reform as well as improved supervision o f the
insurance industry and o f the market for securities.

62

35.
The Bank also undertook a number o f reports on the observance o f standards and
codes (ROSC) which contributed significantly to the policy dialogue with respect the
enabling environment for private sector development. A ROSC on accounting and
auditing was issued in June 2004. I t found that the generally accepted accounting and
auditing standards o f Chile were well developed but it recommended the full adoption o f
international financial reporting standards (IFRS) to better integrate the Chilean economy
within the global framework.
The Chilean authorities are acting upon that
recommendation and they now plan that the IFRS will become mandatory as from
January 1, 2009. A smooth transition f i o m current standards to the IFRS i s essential and,
to assist in designing the transition, FIRST i s financing consultants who can bring to the
task a broad experience from European countries that have successfully made the change.
In addition, the IDB has mobilized funding from i t s multilateral investment fund (MIF) to
finance technical assistance as the government moves forward with other
recommendations o f the ROSC. They include the design o f simplified accounting
standards and financial reporting obligations for SMEs as well as support for the Chilean
College o f Accountants to establish a certification process for public accountants. This i s
another area where collaboration between the Bank and the IDB has been fruitful in
assisting the client more effectively.
36.
Another issue o f central importance for private sector development concerns
insolvency and the system o f creditor rights. That was the subject o f a ROSC dated June
2004. Notwithstanding a judicial framework that i s generally perceived to be
independent and reliable, the ROSC noted that the 2 to 3 years average duration o f
liquidation proceedings was excessive. I t found the provisions o f the Insolvency L a w to
be insufficiently clear in a number o f respects and it recommended that out-of-court
workouts be encouraged. Following upon the recommendations o f the ROSC the
Insolvency L a w was amended in November 2005 to facilitate pre-packaged agreements
that would provide a fast track for bankrupt f i r m s to reorganize. A second law on capital
markets is s t i l l in Congress but, if approved, i t would make the system o f creditor rights
and insolvency yet more effective. Meanwhile, the regulatory framework for the
supervision o f insolvency administrators has been improved along the lines contemplated
in the ROSC.
37.
Corporate Governance was the subject o f another ROSC dated M a y 2003. I t
found that Chile complies reasonably well with established OECD principles o f corporate
governance. I t made recommendations to further improve the situation including: (i)
legislation to increase transparency for investors, (ii)measures to increase the
accountability o f the Superintendence o f Securities and Insurance (SVS) and to enhance
the transparency o f i t s operations, (iii)
additional resources to permit the SVS to better
conduct market surveillance, (iv) the preparation o f a road map for the better enforcement
o f investor property rights and (v) the establishment o f an Institute o f Directors to provide
training for supervisory board members, disseminate best practice and foster dialogue
between the public and private sectors. In the sixth meeting o f the Latin American
Corporate Governance Roundtable, the Chilean delegation made specific reference to
new measures that were being introduced in response to the ROSC report. They included
the establishment in 2005 o f a Centro para el Gobierno de la Empresa (CGE) to promote

63

the adoption o f best practices in Chilean corporate governance. CGE seminars and
conferences have already reached a broad audience o f corporate directors and the CGE i s
actively engaged with government authorities to improve the legislative framework and
set a common agenda for the future.
IFC support f o r private sector development

38.
During the CAS period, IFC’s strategy focused on high impact areas, including
support for SMEs and specialized financial market activity including housing finance,
infrastructure, and the social sectors. The I F C engagement also responded to the
Government’s priorities on growth and competitiveness and placed greatest emphasis o n
projects where IFC’s involvement would have a high demonstration effect in sectors
identified as high priority by the government such as the energy sector. Overall, the
objectives set out in the 2002 CAS were amply fulfilled.
39.
From FY02 through FY06 the I F C committed US$364 million, including US$148
million for syndications through the B-loan program. The commitments financed nine
projects in five diverse sectors spanning education, finance, information, transportation
and utilities. As o f December 31, 2005, IFC’s portfolio for Chile stood at US$264
million (including syndications), about twice the level at the beginning o f the 2002 CAS
period.
40.
In the education sector, the I F C provided a US$7.2 million partial credit
guarantee to the University o f Diego Portales for a local currency bond. The bond
proceeds have been used to finance the University’s expansion and modernization project
aimed at consolidating the University’s market position and improving i t s overall quality.
I t i s also providing additional space needed to increase student enrollment from 9,300
students in 2003 to approximately 14,000 students by 2010 (a 50 percent increase). This
transaction was the first future cash flow securitization in Chile and the first by a Latin
American University.
41.
In the financial sector, the IFC committed US$5 million in FY05 to a leading
factoring company that offers domestic and international services to small and medium
size companies and has a portfolio o f about 1,700 clients. Inthat same year, the IFC also
invested US$11 million in a Chilean private equity fund which invests in mid-size
Chilean companies that are reorienting their business to export markets, that service
export-oriented firms, or whose long-term competitive strategies are focused on
developing economies o f scale.
42.
The I F C supported three projects in the utilities sector. In FY03, the I F C
committed US$60 million to Chile’s primary electricity transmission company. This
financing has helped the company expand and upgrade i t s network in order to provide
access to the grid to new electricity generating plants as they have been coming on line in
recent years. I t has also supported the company’s plans to develop interconnections with
other transmission systems in Chile, hence enhancing competition in the sector. In FY04,
the I F C committed US$66 million, including US$33 million in syndications, for a water

64

and sanitation concessionaire in the Maule region to support its five-year capital
expenditure program. The program primarily consists o f the construction o f wastewater
treatment facilities and operation and maintenance programs to its existing networks, and
also includes the expansion o f i t s sewerage network. With the implementation o f this
program the coverage o f water, wastewater and wastewater treatment i s expected to be
nearly 100 percent in the target region by 2007. Finally, in FY06, the IFC committed
U S 1 6 0 million (including syndication) for the construction o f a 155 megawatt
hydroelectric power plant. This project helps expand capacity for renewable generation
o f electricity in Chile thus reducing carbon emissions associated with power generation.
43.
The I F C also supported two projects in the transport sector. In FY03 the I F C
provided a US$30 million medium-term standby revolving line o f credit to one o f Latin
America’s leading airlines at a time when the airline sector was facing several challenges.
This was IFC’s first project in the airline sector. In FY04, the I F C committed US$15
million in financing to the operator o f a medium-size port in Chile for the rehabilitation,
expansion and operation o f the port. This port specializes in handling forest products in
bulk, break bulk and containers; and i t s expansion i s helping important export-oriented
users such as forest product firms, fishmeal producers, paper product f i r m s and iron and
steel plants.
In the information sector, the I F C invested US$10 million in FY04 in a leading
44.
I T services provider in Chile to support i t s expansion program in Latin America and to
enhance e-government mechanisms in the region.
Public-Private partnerships

45.
Chile has advanced much further than many other L A C countries with the private
provision o f public infrastructure. I t i s estimated that a total o f some US$8 billion in
private investment has been mobilized through concessions in ports, water supply, energy
and telecommunications. The 2002 CAS envisaged that the Bank would continue to
support public-private partnerships as it had done in the past. The operational context for
that support was provided by a development policy loan in the amount o f U S 3 0 . 1 5
million for a Santiago Urban Transport project which was approved in M a y 2005. The
project i s considered in greater detail later under the rubric o f “sustainability” because i t
has important implications for pollution control. However, an important component o f
the project i s to revamp the concession mechanism for private operators that provide
public transport services and to encourage the participation o f private investors in the
infrastructure program which i s expected to be largely financed without resort to public
finding. In that respect the project represents a continuation o f Bank support for the
private provision o f infrastructure which dates back to the late nineties with operations
such as the second and third road sector projects.
46.

The first phase o f implementing the Santiago Urban Transport project began
successfully with the corporatization o f the bus sector whereby a multiplicity o f small
informal operators have now been replaced with a much fewer number o f formally
organized companies that won concessions awarded early in 2006. While implementation

65

o f the new corporate structure has met with some resistance from some o f the previous
bus operators, once fully in place, the new corporate structure will facilitate the
development o f a rapid transit system with dedicated bus lanes and a closer integration o f
bus transport with the metro service. In parallel to the DPL, a technical assistance loan in
the amount o f US$6.1 million i s being implemented. With support from the TAL, control
mechanisms will be prepared as well as laws and norms for carrying out the technical
supervision o f concessions contracts.
Innovation

47.
Science, technology and innovation were already an important focus o f Bank
support for Chile even prior to the 2002 CAS. A Millennium Science Initiative Project
(see B o x 3 below) was brought to a successful close just as the 2002 CAS was introduced
and, consistent with i t s original objective, it led to successful follow-on activities.
Reference has already been made in an earlier section o f major analytic work on the New
Economy as well as a Development Policy Review both o f which focused on the
incentive framework for innovation as an important element o f a strategy for growth.
48.
In May, 2003 a loan was approved in the amount o f US$25.26 million for a
project entitled “Science for the Knowledge Economy”. The project was conceived as
the first phase o f a program to improve the innovation system in Chile by establishing a
strong and coherent policy framework, by promoting high-quality science and
technology, by supporting interfaces in the innovation system between the public and
private sectors and by encouraging international linkages. A secondary development
objective was to enhance the stock o f human capital with respect to science and
technology which was seen as a critical precondition for a competitive knowledge-based
economy.
49.
Project supervision reports reveal good progress during the first years o f
implementation. In particular the component designed to enhance public-private research
linkages has improved the Chilean S&T system and stimulated cross-sector cooperation
beyond expectations. The project has become a center for innovation in funding research
and there are several examples o f major government institutions adjusting their
procedures to emulate advances made under the project. All triggers for moving to the
second phase - originally programmed for March 2007 - were met in the first quarter o f
2006.
50.
Likewise, there has been notable progress in meeting the specific performance
indicators targeted at appraisal. The annual number o f PhD graduates has risen from 144
in 2003 to 238 in 2005 which i s well on the way to the 300 project target for 2007. The
number o f patents filed with the patent office has risen from 33 in 2003 to 51 in 2005
which i s also well on the way to the project target o f 60 by 2007. Under the project some
34 researchers have been placed in assignments with industry and 9 research consortia
have been formed which i s in excess o f the target o f 5 by 2007. Other specific
performance indicators are also well on track or exceeding expectations. However,
placing the program within the Science Council (CONICYT)has not proved to be optimal

66

and, for the second phase, the Government i s seeking to locate the project more centrally
within the redesigned institutional structure o f the innovation system.
Box 3: Support for Government initiatives in science, technology and innovation
A M i l l e n n i u m Science Initiative (MSI) was supported by a learning and innovation loan (LIL),approved in
1999, and was important in laying the foundation for further collaboration between the Bank and the
Chilean authorities in matters o f science, technology and innovation. The project succeeded in meeting a l l
its development objectives and demonstrated a new way o f supporting scientific research in a cost effective
manner and in ways that strengthened Chile’s National Innovation System.
An implementation completion report in 2002 concluded that the M S I is having an important impact in
Chile and beyond. Chile’s example has been followed by three other L a t i n American countries that have
established M S I s with Bank support and several others have expressed interest in developing their own
M S I . Chile has taken the lead in initiating cooperation with these partner countries under the auspices o f
the M S I program.
The project established a fair, open, and merit-based process for financial support which has been
acknowledged and accepted by the scientific research community. In addition to assuring that grants go to
the most qualified researchers, the selection process has influenced other scientific funding mechanisms in
Chile, prompting them to conform more closely to international best practice.
The project has improved the productivity o f top researchers in Chile. The number o f w e l l trained scientists
i s increasing in Chile which i s an important f i r s t step in reaching a critical mass o f w e l l qualified human
capital needed for a knowledge-based economy. In the context o f the 2005 Development Policy Review the
Bank assembled data which indicates that the number o f scientific articles published by Chilean researchers
i s greater than their counterparts in other L a t i n American countries and compares favorably with Canada
and Spain.
Independent external reviewers have remarked o n the significant increase in collaborative efforts under the
auspices o f the M S I project. Numerous centers have established closer linkages between basic science and
strategic and applied sciences. Linkages have also been established between institutions and scientists at a
national, regional and international level involving both North-South and South-South cooperation.
Of particular significance is the base o f monitoring and evaluation that has been built and that can serve to
improve S&T policy. Panels o f independent expert scientists have helped establish comprehensive baseline
performance indicators for M S I and non-MSI researchers alike.
The success o f the M S I l e d directly to a follow-up project, Science for the Knowledge Economy, which
was supported by a Bank loan in the amount o f US$25.26 m i l l i o n approved in M a y 2003. Progress under
the project i s detailed in paragraphs 47-50. The Bank also undertook major analytic w o r k o n innovation in
a report o n the N e w Economy and also as part o f the Development Policy Review.

Education

51.
The special emphasis o n science technology and innovation needs to be viewed
within the context o f a broader program o f Bank support for education and human
development. A Higher Education Improvement Project was successfully completed in
2004 and an implementation completion report dated December 2005 concluded that the
overall achievement o f the project development objectives was highly satisfactory.
Indeed, the project significantly exceeded i t s objectives in many areas. The scope and
acceptance o f university program accreditation went far beyond what was foreseen in the

67

design phase. A new instrument - institutional accreditation - was added during project
implementation, thereby further consolidating quality assurance in Chile.

The Higher Education Improvement Project also helped achieve a better balance
52.
between regions by improving quality in some o f Chile’s smallest universities. With
finance provided under the project, these institutions were able to address problems such
as a lack o f qualified staff, inadequate facilities and outdated curricula. An analysis of
public funding for recurrent expenditure (Aporte Fiscal Directo, A F D ) from 1999 to 2005
reveals that funding per student was directly related to university size. By contrast, the
competitive fund supported by the project allocated on average 63 percent more per
student to universities with less than 5,000 students than to universities with more than
5,000 students (US$194 for small universities vs. US$119 for large universities).
Moreover, the competitive fund was successful in redirecting resources to universities
outside the capital area and the central regions o f Chile. Universities in the capital area
received 47 percent o f AFD between 1999 and 2003 but only 32 percent o f resources
allocated through the competitive fund. Additional resources for investment gave an
important boost to regional universities. For example, the University o f Magallanes, a
small university located in the extreme South o f Chile, increased enrollment by 18
percent between 1999 and 2004 in part due to investments in classrooms and laboratories
made through the project.
53.
The Higher Education Improvement Project also paved the way for several
reforms o f student aid in Chile by providing technical assistance and financing key
studies on policy options and best practice. Although not foreseen in the design phase, the
project contributed to the formulation o f a new law on student aid that opened financial
assistance to students in private universities, professional institutes and centers for
technical education. Initiatives to improve coverage were successful in increasing public
funding for student aid by 50 percent in real terms between 1999 and 2005. Moreover,
the project supported system design for targeting financial assistance to talented students
with the greatest need by funding the establishment o f a new information system in the
Ministry o f Education. This system improved the socio-economic profiling o f students by
consolidating income data from several databases. Household data show that, between
1996 and 2003, Chile made steady progress in improving access to tertiary education for
students from low income families. In this period enrollment increased by 6.0 percent for
students from the first income quintile and by 6.1 percent for students from the second
income quintile.
54.
The success o f the Higher Education Improvement Project paved the way for an
APL in the amount o f US$25.13 which was approved in 2006 for a project entitled
“Tertiary Education Finance for Results”. The choice o f an adaptable program loan as
the appropriate lending instrument in this case reflected the sentiment shared by the
Government and the Bank alike that a long-term partnership best serves the interest o f
Chile in implementing i t s development strategy for tertiary education. Specific objectives
o f the project, which i s viewed as the first phase o f an extended program, are to (i)
enhance the quality and relevance o f tertiary education in Chile through curricula
ensure access to tertiary education for all talented
redesign and upgrading o f faculty, (ii)

68

individuals and, (iii)
improve internal efficiency and accountability for results through
performance agreements with tertiary education institutions. Indeed, the new higher
education program i s built around performance agreements. The project has been
successfully launched and i s on track.
Box 4: Chile CaliJica - Support for adult and technical education
In 2002 the government introduced a multifaceted program o f lifelong learning known as Chile Califica.
The program i s a j o i n t initiative o f the Ministry o f Education, the Ministry o f Economy and the Ministry o f
Labor and Social Security and i t aims t o fill a number o f gaps in the traditional system o f education with a
special focus o n working adults whose basic education i s less than complete o r w h o need additional skills
that would enable them t o advance in the labor force.

Another objective o f Chile Calijka i s to set the ground for a National System o f Skills Standards to
facilitate workforce development, employment and productivity. In addition, the project i s fostering
networks between the corporate sector and technical education and training institutions, so that they can
better serve the needs o f a rapidly changing economy. In that context, information systems are being
developed to monitor the demand for different skills, to ensure that the system o f technical education i s
responsive t o the needs o f the labor market, to develop a certification system based o n assessed standards o f
labor competency and t o introduce a system o f labor intermediation that can effectively match the demand
for labor skills with the available supply. At the same time, efforts are being made to improve the quality o f
technical education with programs o f teacher training, curriculum development and the networking o f
technical education establishments.
The target beneficiaries o f Chile CaliJica are the poorest members o f the population, many o f w h o m are
currently working or seeking work and who need t o upgrade their level o f basic education or their
vocational skills in order to improve their employment prospects. The program also targets youth and
workers w h o could benefit f r o m technical education at an intermediate or higher level. M o r e broadly, it
seeks to make the entire system o f skills certification more flexible so that qualifications can receive
recognition even though they m a y have been acquired through different non-traditional routes.
The Bank has supported Chile Califica since its inception and has worked closely with the Chilean
authorities t o assist in getting the program launched and on-track. The principal vehicle for Bank support
has been a loan in the amount o f US$75.75 that was approved in M a r c h 2002 in support o f a Lifelong
Learning and Training Project.

55.
T o complement i t s support for higher education, the Bank is also assisting Chile
to implement the program o f Chile Calzjka (see B o x 4). A loan o f US$75.75 m i l l i o n was
approved in March 2002 for a Lifelong Learning and Training Project with the following
multiple objectives: (i)
to provide new opportunities for lifelong learning and training, (ii)
to improve the quality and increase the coverage o f technical-professional education, (iii)
establish instruments to support the provision o f lifelong learning and training services
and (iv) to strengthen institutions and thereby ensure the effective and efficient
coordination o f project implementation at the national and regional levels. Project
implementation reports indicate that the financial and physical progress o f this project has
been satisfactory with measurable progress in outcome indicators. Enrollment in tertiary
technical education institutions increased from 54 thousand students in 2001 to 62
thousand at end o f school-year 2003. In 2001 only 9.3 percent o f SMEs made use o f tax
rebates or other public financial mechanisms to finance in-house training programs. By
2004 that percentage had risen to 18 percent for SMEs in agriculture, 14 percent for
69

manufacturing and 12.7 percent for construction. An important project objective was to
establish a labor intermediation information system. The labor information system is
now operating in 152 municipal labor offices covering some 90 percent o f the country.

56.
Notwithstanding good progress in higher education and some other areas, Chile i s
making insufficient headway in improving the quality o f education in primary and
secondary schools. Dissatisfaction with the quality o f general education and the
perceived persistent inequality o f educational opportunities were important factors
leading to widespread student strikes in 2006 which were o f serious concern to the
incoming Bachelet administration.
The Bank’s country dialogue on education goes beyond specific project support
57.
and has focused on the achievements o f the education system overall. In terms o f analytic
work and policy advice, the Bank contributed to the education sector dialogue with a
comprehensive analysis o f sector issues in the Development Policy Review and a more
selective focus on pre-school child care in Policy Notes submitted to the incoming
Bachelet administration in 2006. This i s an area in which the new administration has
expressed keen interest and initial discussions o f the policy notes indicate that they have
been well received. In addition, the Bank has been collaborating with the Ministry o f
Education to strengthen i t s capacity to evaluate the impact o f policies and programs.
Within the context o f i t s AAA program, the Bank is currently supporting the Ministry in
i t s deliberations with respect to setting up a superintendency o f education.
Sustainability

58.
A major strategic focus o f Pillar 1 was to develop sustainable approaches for the
management o f natural resources, especially watershed and forestry, and to support
efforts for the reduction o f pollution. To that end, and in addition to the Bank’s own
resources, the Bank was to mobilize resources from the GEF, the Prototype Carbon Fund
and the Montreal Protocol which aimed at eliminating the production and consumption o f
ozone-depleting substances (ODs), specifically CFCs, halen and methyl bromide.

59.
The base-case lending program proposed in the 2002 CAS included an APL in the
amount o f U S $ l 5 0 million for a Water Resource Management Project which was already
in an advanced stage o f preparation. I t was envisaged that the project would help develop
a decentralized institutional framework to improve water resource management and
protect freshwater biodiversity. A proposed loan was prepared and pre-appraised by
Bank staff but was not taken to appraisal, in part because the Government was facing
budget constraints as a result o f the Asian crisis. The preparatory work was nevertheless
fruitful in assisting the Government on i t s own account to proceed at a later date with
several o f the components identified and studied. The Ministry o f Public Works has
financed works on targeted watersheds. The transfer o f infrastructure to user
organizations, a key action contemplated during project preparation, was completed for
the Puciaro dam and users now have full control over the management and administration
o f the dam and i t s irrigation infrastructure. Discussions with the Ministry o f Works

70

reveal that i t i s considering additional investments in infrastructure identified during
project preparation.
60.
Global programs, on the other hand, delivered more than was envisaged in the
CAS, in many cases continuing with initiatives that were begun in the decade o f the
nineties. In 1993 a GEF grant had been approved in the amount o f US$6.46 million to
assist Chile to comply with the 1987 Montreal Protocol Treaty. The project was
structured in two phases. The overall objective o f the first phase was to achieve a 63
percent reduction in the consumption o f ODS by Chile. The second phase aimed at (i)
completely phasing out by 2010 the remaining 37 percent (approximately 400 tons) and
(b) developing by 2006 a regulatory framework for complete phase out and consolidating
the institutional capacity gained by Chile in the execution o f the Montreal Protocol
program. By end-2003, Chile had already eliminated 380 metric tons o f ODS which put
i t well ahead o f schedule. In October 2005, Congress enacted legislation to place caps on
the import o f controlled substances and the Environmental Authority, C O N A M A , issued
implementing regulations in early 2006. A Bank mission in April 2006 concluded that
the project had achieved or surpassed all i t s objectives.
61.
The Bank was also actively supportive o f projects sponsored by the Prototype
Carbon Fund as envisaged in the CAS Program Matrix. The Chacabuquito Hydropower
project that had been prepared and appraised by the Bank became operational in 2002 and
i s functioning well. The 25 M W plant has resulted in emission reductions equivalent to
80,000 tons o f C02 per year. Another 50 MW Hydropower plant at Homitos i s presently
under construction. W h e n i t comes on stream in 2007, i t will result in emission
reductions estimated at 180,000 tons o f C02 equivalent per year. A third 7 0 M W project
at Quilleco has been prepared and i s ready for appraisal. The annual carbon emission
reductions resulting from that plant are estimated at 200,000 tons o f C02 equivalent. All
these projects are run-of-the-river and they contribute to the country objectives o f Chile
in mitigating climate change and pursuing energy self-sufficiency.
An even more direct initiative to reduce pollution, specifically in the Santiago
62.
metropolitan area, i s the already mentioned Santiago Urban Transport Project for which a
DPL in the amount o f US$30.16 million was approved in July 2005. The loan was made
in support o f the government’s 2000-2010 Urban Transport Plan for Santiago
(TRANSANTIAGO) which aims to redesign the transport system o f the metropolitan
region through better traffic flows, reduced travel time, improved air quality from a
reduction in air pollutants, better access to public transport and improved mobility. N o t
only will the project greatly improve transport efficiency but, by reconfiguring bus routes
i t aims to reduce the number o f bus-kilometers by 30 percent. That reduction, together
with a bus fleet that has been re-equipped with improved vehicles, will cut-back particle
contamination from buses by an estimated 75 percent. Since buses alone account for 40
percent o f a l l particle contamination in Santiago, the upgrading o f the bus fleet will
contribute significantly to an improvement in air quality. I t i s likely that air pollution has
already been reduced with the partial reconfiguration o f bus routes although this has not
yet been confirmed by testing. There have been set-backs in making the transition to the
new system, particularly with regard to introducing a new smartcard ticketing system that

71

will permit the integration o f metro fares and bus fares. As a result, the full
implementation o f TRANSANTIAGO has been delayed. However, the authorities are
fully committed to full implementation and progress i s steadily being made.

63.
Alongside the DPL, the Bank also approved a loan o f US$6.1 million for a
Santiago Urban Transport Technical Assistance project with the primary objective o f
supporting the implementation, monitoring, evaluation and continuous planning o f the
urban transport reform program. Within that broad objective, specific provision was
made for supporting the monitoring o f air quality and strengthening environmental
guidelines for the management o f public works. In 2005 a PHRD grant was furnished to
analyze in greater depth the effect on climate change o f improved bus fuels and
technologies.
BOX5: TMNSANTIAGO Support for more efficient and less pollutingtransport in the capital city
Twenty years o f sustained economic growth has placed a great strain o n the transport system o f Santiago, a
city that contains more than one third o f the country’s population and produces almost h a l f o f i t s GDP.
With the a i m o f making Santiago into a world-class competitive city, the government introduced a ten year
(2000-2010) urban transport plan, known as TRANSANTIAGO, to improve the transport system, reduce
congestion and pollution and increase safety.
K e y reforms introduced by the TRANSANTIAGOprogram are as follows:
Introduce traffic management schemes giving priority t o public transport vehicles, such as
exclusive public transport axes during rush hours and physically segregated lanes reserved for
public transport vehicles.
Replace the many less-than-formal operators that previously tendered bus services with 15
concessions contracted by competitive bidding.
Replace the o l d inefficient and highly-polluting bus fleet with high-standard vehicles that have
improved fuel efficiency together with greater passenger comfort and safety.
Reconfigure the bus routes into a two-tier system with trunk lines operating as m u c h as possible
o n segregated bus lanes and a secondary system o f collection and distribution lines.
Introduce a unified fare system for bus and metro services with fare collection managed separately
by a competitively awarded concession.
Establish a public transport management and information center t o control the system-wide bus
flow. All buses are to be equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System) so that compliance with
concession contracts can be checked as far as levels o f service are concerned.
Establish coordinated transport and infrastructure planning mechanisms at the metropolitan level.
Improve conditions for cyclists and pedestrians.
The plan has been widely acclaimed for i t s technical excellence and visionary design. However, start-up
difficulties have delayed full implementation o f the program. Traditional and informal bus operators have
resisted the corporatization o f bus services, and there have been difficulties in designing and introducing a
unified fare system for buses and the metro.
The Bank i s supporting the implementation o f TRANSANTIAGO with a US$30.16 m i l l i o n Santiago Urban
Transport D P L to be followed by a second US$70 m i l l i o n D P L if the program continues to progress
satisfactorily. In addition there i s a US$6.1 m i l l i o n technical assistance loan to support implementation,
monitoring and evaluation. Related environmental issues are being addressed with support from a GEF
grant in the amount o f US$6.98.

72

64.
The two Bank loans for TRANSANTIAGOwere complemented by a GEF grant in
the amount o f US$6.98 million which was approved in November 2003 for a project
entitled “Sustainable Transport and Air Quality for Santiago”. The overall objective o f
the project i s to help reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) from ground transport in Santiago
through a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms o f transport
and the adoption o f sustainable low-GHG transport measures. Most project components
have advanced satisfactorily in tandem with the progress o f TRANSANTIAGO. However,
there have been some procurement delays with the component that seeks to encourage the
use o f bicycles possibly because the procurement packages are too small to attract bids
from suppliers.
65.
Bank support for environmental protection also extended to a Valdivia Forest
Zone Project which aimed at the conservation o f biodiversity and for which a GEF grant
had been approved in 2000 prior to the CAS. That project was brought to closure
successfully in 2004 with all performance indicators fully achieved. The aim o f the
project was to enhance the conservation o f the Valdivian temperate forests by increasing
the role o f the private sector in protected area management. An explicit performance
indicator was to increase the number o f private protected areas (PPAs) within the
Valdivian temperate forests. That objective was amply achieved and, at the end o f the
project there were 163 PPAs in the region compared with only 26 at the start. Training in
the management o f protected areas was provided to 210 beneficiaries compared with a
target o f 160. Technical assistance was provided to 38 owners and managers o f PPAs
compared with a target o f 30. Information was disseminated to 800 individual and
institutions compared with a target o f 400. The achievements o f the project are judged to
be sustainable and, at the national level, i t had a significant effect on shaping a new
institutional and regulatory framework for PPAs that was promulgated by presidential
decree in June 2003.
66.
Another Bank-supported initiative o f significant environmental importance was a
Santiago Foothills Project for which a GEF grant was approved in 2001 shortly prior to
the CAS. That project was successfully implemented throughout the CAS period and
closed in June 2006. I t s overall goal was to protect, conserve, and restore in-situ a 12,900
hectare area that i s located in the proximity o f Santiago (the Santiago Foothills) and that
i s representative o f a mediterranean-mountainous ecosystem. To that end, i t aimed to
improve the legal, institutional and political framework needed to create a conservation
area, foster among the urban population an enhanced appreciation o f this ecosystem and
promote the mainstreaming o f efforts to conserve mountainous ecosystems into the urban
planning process. The completion report documents that, o f the 45 institutional and
organizational objectives targeted by the project, 42 o f them were 100 percent achieved,
two o f them were 200 percent over-achieved and one was over-achieved fourfold.

73

Pillar 2: Inclusion
Overview

67.
The three pillars o f Bank support that were articulated in the 2002 CAS are not
independent o f each other. There are important components o f Pillar 1 (Sustaining
Economic Growth and Social Progress) that have a direct bearing upon the issue o f
inclusion. In particular, the expansion o f education opportunities for the poor i s a
fundamental consideration for inclusion. Similarly, some components o f Pillar 3
(Modernization o f the State) directly facilitate inclusion, particularly as they relate to
decentralization and the ability o f local authorities to respond to the needs o f local
communities. However, the principal explicit focus o f Pillar 2 in the 2002 CAS was the
delivery o f health and other social services to the population at large, as well as the
provision o f basic infrastructure to poor rural communities in remote regions.
Country outcomes were mixed. As with outcomes under Pillar I,results were
68.
generally good when they were dependent upon direct government action. A new and
improved health care system (Plan A UGE) was effectively introduced. The provision o f
infrastructure was extended to greater numbers o f the rural poor and local governments
were given progressively more authority to handle local services. However, the indirect
results anticipated as a result o f government actions were not always forthcoming within
the time frame envisaged. The targeted increase o f participation in private pension plans
did not materialize, school test scores did not improve as expected and participation o f
women in the labor force did not increase as targeted.

CAS outcomes were generally very good. The program o f lending operations
69.
was delivered in full as indicated in Attachment 5. Lending effectively supported the
introduction o f the Chile Solidurio program, a major new initiative in social protection
and it also assisted with the extension o f infrastructure to greater numbers o f the rural
poor. The technical assistance and AAA furnished by the Bank was well received and
put to effective use in designing new initiatives for the management o f social risks, health
reform and the more effective incorporation o f gender considerations into local and
national programs.
Health

70.
Health insurance issues were the subject o f a major flagship study that was
undertaken by the Bank prior to the 2002 CAS. The study focused, in particular, on old
age and catastrophic health costs. I t was an explicit performance indicator o f the 2002
CAS that advice offered in the study be reflected in the recommendations o f a health
reform commission and subsequently incorporated into a new legal framework for health
care.
71.
In 2004 and 2005 Chile introduced a major structural reform to the country’s
health system which incorporated many o f the recommendations o f the health reform
commission. This was a third generation o f reforms, the most extensive and complex

74

since the creation o f a National Health Service in 1952, i t s subsequent reform and the
establishment o f a National Health Fund and private health insurance institutions in 1982.
The results from a steady improvement in health services have been impressive. Over the
last 15 years Chile has made notable improvements in health indicators, including a 50
percent reduction in child mortality, an increase in life expectancy to 78, and an extension
o f health insurance coverage to over 90 percent o f the population.
72.
The new health insurance package (Plan o f Universal Access with Explicit
Guarantees-A UGE) aims to increase effective access to health services. Rather than
continuing to offer unrealistic promises to cover all health needs, AUGE establishes a
guaranteed minimum basic package o f health services for all Chileans, along with
guarantees o f medical attention within specified time periods, explicit ceilings on copayments and full subsidies for the poorest households. The new system aims to
eliminate rationing and improve service. Since January 1, 2004, AUGE has been
mandatory for all citizens and all public and private providers o f health insurers. In
policy notes to the incoming Bachelet administration, the Bank indicated that successful
implementation o f the new plan would depend critically upon a well-functioning
monitoring system which needs to be designed and put in place.
Social protection

73.
The broader system o f social protection was a major focus o f Bank support
envisaged in the 2002 CAS. In FY04 the Bank delivered a study entitled “Household
Risk Management and Social Protection” which was much wider in scope than the earlier
study on catastrophic health costs. I t examined the entire range o f social protection
instruments for managing household financial r i s k s associated with j o b loss, sickness or
injury, old age and “residual” or structural poverty. I t sought to determine the extent to
which the many public programs and policies in Chile added up to a comprehensive and
coherent system o f social protection. I t found that, o n the whole, Chile succeeds in
providing qufficient instruments to mitigate shocks to income but, too many households even among the non-poor - do not have access to the sophisticated social protection
instruments that are in place. The study recommended that, for purposes o f access to
social protection programs, the government should not make so sharp a distinction
between workers in formal employment and those in the informal sector. The recently
introduced Chile Solidurio program was seen as an important first step towards a better
coordination and integration o f social protection policies.
74.
Social protection was also the main operational focus o f Bank lending in the
period covered by the 2002 CAS. The principal instrument mobilized by the Bank in
support o f government efforts towards greater inclusion was a Social Protection Sector
Adjustment Loan in the amount o f US$200 million which was accompanied by a Social
Protection Technical Assistance Loan in the amount o f US$10.71 million. These loans,
both o f which were approved in December 2003, accounted for almost half o f Bank
lending during the CAS period. At the government’s request the S A L was structured as a
Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) which had recently been introduced as a loan
instrument that offered the opportunity o f not tapping into the resources until there was a

75

need. The intention was for the operation to fulfill the dual purpose o f supporting social
sector reform while, at the same time, furnishing the Government with a risk-hedging
instrument that could facilitate macroeconomic management.

With respect to social sector reform the loans supported government actions in
75.
four key areas. First, they supported the Chile Solidario initiative (see B o x 6 below)
which aimed to reform the poverty reduction and social protection policies o f Chile.
Second, they aimed to improve the efficiency and efficacy o f social policies with
improved targeting and by establishing a national information system that would
integrate household data from public and private sources that are relevant to social policy.
Third they aimed to strengthen the regular monitoring o f social programs and policies
with a view to evaluating their impact. Fourth, they aimed to support the government in
its efforts to ensure the sustainability o f reforms in social protection policies and poverty
reduction by clearly defining the division o f responsibilities between central government,
municipal authorities and civil society.
76.
Based upon a three-year prospective drawdown period under the DDO financial
arrangement, the closing date for the Social Protection SAL was originally targeted for
January 2007. However, almost immediately after loan effectiveness, the Government
decided to draw down the entire loan amount and the loan was closed in April 2004.
Shortly after the proceeds o f the loan were drawn down, Chile prepaid a number o f
earlier Bank loans for an equivalent total amount. I t would appear, therefore, that the
DDO arrangement did not fulfill the intended risk hedging objectives. In comments that
were attached to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Social Protection
SAL, the Government explained that the commitment fee charged by the Bank on
undisbursed loan amounts was a strong incentive to rapid drawdown which influenced
their decision.

76

Box 6: Chile Solidario - Support for the r e f o r m of social protection
In M a y 2002 the government announced the Chile Solidario initiative, a package o f legislative and
admmistrative reforms that significantly improved the policy framework for poverty reduction and social
protection. The reforms have significantly extended the coverage and effectiveness o f social protection,
thereby directly contributing t o poverty reduction. The central principles governing the reforms are as
follows:
Institute a proactive outreach t o the neediest, many o f w h o m were previously unable to access the
social protection system.
Focus o n the family as the beneficiary unit rather than o n the individual.
Shift f r o m the previous piecemeal approach o f separate, targeted social assistance and social
insurance programs by combining multiple services and cash transfers into a n e w conditional cash
transfer t o poor families that choose to participate.
Eliminate quotas and the rationing o f benefits and services for the neediest.
Connect previously excluded groups to the network o f public and private services.
Reduce the number o f intermediaries between the providers and the beneficiaries o f social
protection services.
A c t as a catalyst for targeted interventions in other social sectors.
Under the Chile Solidario initiative social workers go door t o door and invite indigent families to
participate in a two-year program o f social support. Once enrolled, the families are assisted in defining a
strategy for meeting their needs in critical areas such as health, education, employment and housing. Their
progress in implementing the strategy i s monitored over the two year duration o f the program.
Participating households receive a conditional cash transfer as an incentive to stay in the program and, upon
graduation, they are granted preferential access to other social services in their areas o f need.
The Bank supported the Chile Solidario initiative with a Social Protection Sector Adjustment L o a n in the
amount o f U S 2 0 0 m i l l i o n and a Social Protection Technical Assistance L o a n in the amount o f US$10.71
million.

77.
The I C R for the SAL concluded that the achievement o f objectives and outputs
was satisfactory although, since very little time had passed loan approval and drawdown,
it was not yet possible to see major expected outcomes. Nevertheless, the reform
program supported by the loan i s on-track and, based o n information currently available,
it would appear that i t has provided a sound basis for establishing a modem social
protection system in Chile within an environment o f sound macroeconomic management.
In March 2004, a law governing the Chile Solidario program was approved by Congress
and enacted two months later. Funding for this and other critical social programs was
included in the budget. The number o f families participating in Chile Solidario increased
from 80,000 cited in the Program Document to 224 thousand in mid-2006. A further 10
thousand families were invited to join the program but declined. Hence, the target o f
inviting 225 thousand families to participate by 2006 was more than fulfilled.
Gender Issues

78.
A Country Gender Assessment was completed in FY06 at the request o f the
Chilean authorities although it was not anticipated in the 2002 CAS. This was a joint

77

product with the IDB and i t was delivered at a time when the incoming administration o f
President Bachelet expressed heightened interest in the issue. Using cross-country
evidence and micro data simulations for Chile, the joint IBRD-IDB study concluded that
an increase in female labor’force participation from the present l o w level o f 37 percent to
around the L A C region average o f 50 percent could increase growth significantly and
have a sizable effect on poverty reduction. Key recommendations were to adapt current
policies for the expansion o f childcare to better accommodate the needs o f women
workers, especially those from low income households, and to design new training and
life-long learning programs or modify existing ones to better facilitate women’s entry
into the labor markets or reentry after child rearing. Female participation in the labor
force i s a critical issue o f public policy in Chile today, and the Country Gender
Assessment constitutes an important contribution to the policy debate.

79.
The Country Gender Assessment complemented a collaborative effort between
the Bank and SERNAM, the government department for women’s affairs, to evaluate the
first five-year phase o f a government plan entitled “Equal Opportunities between Men
and Women 2000-2010”. The evaluation was issued in December 2005 and i t concluded
that the plan has led to major achievements institutionalizing a gender approach in public
sector management as well as in final public service delivery. Gender concerns have been
effectively introduced into programs at the level o f the central government, the regions
and the municipalities thereby fulfilling an explicit self-evaluation indicator o f the 2002
CAS. Progress has been particularly impressive in advancing women’s rights and in
combating domestic violence. For the remaining five years the evaluation identifies two
priority areas o f action as: (i)consolidating achievements in the fight against domestic
increasing female participation in the political arena. To those two
violence and (ii)
priorities a third should be added from the Country Gender Assessment namely: (iii)
increasing female participation in the labor force.
Rural Infrastructure

80.
The more extensive provision o f infrastructure to the rural poor was another focus
o f Pillar 2 relating to the overall objective o f inclusion. During preparation o f the 2002
CAS, the Government expressed particular interest in an integrated approach to
delivering rural infrastructure that would have a greater impact on poverty alleviation and
economic development for the rural poor. The Bank-Government dialogue and
infrastructure research program culminated in two regional workshops and one national
cross-sector workshops in Chile in June 2003. The outcome o f the workshops was
incorporated into the Study o f Rural Infrastructure and into the design o f a new Banksupported regional infrastructure project.
8 1.
Chile i s generally well supplied with infrastructure. Extending the system to the
last two or three percent o f the population in locations that are often remote and difficult
to access poses very special problems. Although the Study o f Rural Infrastructure made
sector-specific recommendations for the better provision o f water and sanitation, rural
roads, power (including off-grid electricity service) and telecommunications, it was the
cross-sector recommendations that pointed the way to a new approach for the provision

78

o f rural infrastructure. The study proposed a “territorial development model” as key to
developing an efficient strategy for reaching the unserved population. I t recognized that,
to address the needs o f this largely poor and dispersed rural population requires
innovative new methodologies for project design, financing, implementation and
evaluation. I t recommended increased community participation in design and
implementation, specifically the participation o f indigenous peoples and women, so that
projects would better meet local demands and achieve sustainability through improved
maintenance and community support.
82.
In parallel, but separate from the rural infrastructure study, the Bank undertook a
study entitled “Bringing Broadband Internet to Chile’s Rural Areas” which was dated
M a y 2003, The study examined technical options for extending broadband connectivity
to rural communities taking into account their geographical location, their distance from
telecommunications infrastructure and line o f sight characteristics. I t also explored
possible business models bearing in mind that (i)since i t i s more expensive to provide
broadband services to rural areas, operators would need to charge higher prices to rural
consumers, and (ii)
broadband take-up i s quite price sensitive and, with lower incomes in
rural areas, higher prices may stifle demand. Accordingly, the study concluded that the
Chilean Telecommunications Development Fund (FDT) would need to use i t s subsidy
mechanism if the equal opportunity objectives o f the Government are to be met.
83.
The rural infrastructure study was followed by a Bank supported “Infrastructure
for Territorial Development Project” for which a loan o f US$50.26 million was approved
in December 2004. The project incorporates participatory approaches to the design and
implementation o f rural infrastructure projects as a means to enhance ownership, tailor
the investment to local demands and improve the sustainability o f investments. I t
introduced a territorial approach with a focus on cohesive communities that cut across
administrative boundaries. I t also embraced the principle that, when several infrastructure
services are made available simultaneously in the same rural area, the impact can be
greater than the sum o f the individual effects. Some twenty territorial locations were
selected in four o f the poorest regions o f Chile to develop infrastructure plans on a
ground-up basis. During the first year o f implementation, project supervision missions
found that the key concept o f territorial development had become well understood and
internalized by the various stakeholders at both central and local levels. Meanwhile,
some initial investments have already taken place in cases where they had been preidentified when testing the territorial planning process during project preparation.

A separate yet related issue that has a direct bearing upon issues o f inclusion i s
84.
the reform o f government policy with respect to the zones o f Chile that are in the extreme
north and the extreme south o f the country, far from the political and economic center.
To assist in that endeavor, the Bank undertook a study entitled “Zonas Extremas Policies
and Beyond” which was published in October 2005. The study concluded that
government policies for the Extreme Zones (ZE) are diffused and fragmented, making
monitoring and evaluation difficult. The ZEs are, in comparison to other regions, small
in population and large in territory. Contrary to expectations and to the popular image,
they are highly urbanized, above average in terms o f regional GDP and even more so

79

with respect to household income. They are also among the best performers in terms o f
social indicators. Unlike many other regions the ZEs have not experienced out-migration,
significant income differentials or unemployment differentials commonly associated with
disadvantaged regions.

85.
Notwithstanding there advantages the ZEs are the recipients o f very generous
allocations for social expenditures and for public investment. That follows a pattern seen
in many other countries, including developed countries, that possess geographically
extreme regions and i t may be related to strategic objectives o f national security. The
study recommended that the entire range o f ZE policies be reexamined to improve
efficiency and to ensure that they resonate collectively with the challenges and
opportunities facing Chile in the 21Stcentury. The study has been received with interest
by the government and, even before publication the government proposed to change
some o f the special tax incentives enjoyed by the ZEs in order to make them less prone to
tax evasion or tax fraud, as the study had recommended.
Pillar 3: Modernization of the State

Overview

86.

Consistent with i t s medium-term objective whereby Chile would converge with
OECD countries in terms o f per capita income, the government has given a high priority
to modernizing the state. In support o f that endeavor the CAS identified four broad areas
where the Bank could focus i t s assistance most productively. The first related to
improving the core management functions o f the public sector with an emphasis o n
developing a modem, integrated management system to better address the needs o f
decentralized agencies. A second area o f endeavor related to the further expansion o f
public-private participation where Chile had already made considerable advances and
where the Bank had a long been supportive o f those efforts. Third, the CAS focused on
decentralization, especially with respect to defining a role for regional governments and
strengthening the capacity o f municipalities to carry out their functions. Transparency
and accountability was a fourth aspect o f state modernization supported by the CAS, with
a special focus on the better public provision o f information by electronic means.

87.
Country outcomes were very good. State modernization i s an area over which
the government has considerable control and country outcomes directly reflected the
many purposeful actions o f the government. Chile i s a leader in Latin America with
respect to the application o f information technology and i t has made ample use o f the
internet to improve transparency accountability and efficiency. E-government i s widely
practiced to the point where over 90 percent o f tax returns are filed electronically.
Meaningful progress has been made in extending decentralization to the regions and to
municipalities and public-private partnerships are widespread. However, Chile s t i l l has
some way to go before the regions are truly autonomous. Most program and project
decisions made at the regional level originate in the regional offices o f central
government ministries and agencies.

80

88.
CAS outcomes were also very good, reflecting a productive collaborative
relationship between the Bank and the client. Within the context o f AAA, including feefor-service consultancies, the Bank was able to mobilize a broad range o f international
expertise which the government perceived as helpful in enabling i t to move forward
towards i t s declared goal o f convergence with O E C D economies. M a n y o f the studies
reviewed above in the section concerning Pillar I had a direct bearing upon state
modernization. In the area o f local government, where a programmed Bank loan was
dropped, the government continued to move forward with the program without Bank
assistance having fully internalized the approach adopted in earlier Bank-assisted
projects. Lending operations in support o f public expenditure management and social
protection have already been reviewed in the context o f other pillars o f Bank support and
they also successfully contributed to the modernization o f the state.
Core management functions o f the state

89.
M u c h o f the Bank lending and AAA already discussed in the context o f Pillar I
has a direct bearing upon modernization o f the state. The information management
system (SIGFE) that i s being introduced with Bank support in the context o f a Public
Expenditure Management Project will be central to improving the core management
functions o f the state, particularly as they relate to the interface between the central
government and decentralized agencies. Similarly, improvements in the preparation and
implementation o f the budget - specifically the introduction o f results-oriented budgeting
- w i l l improve the overall management o f the state.
90.
Bank analytic work, particularly with respect to fiduciary issues, has also been
very relevant to state modernization as has been the work done o n technology and
innovation. Likewise, major studies o f the N e w Economy and the Development Policy
Review addressed many issues relating to the modernization o f the state.

At the request o f the Budget Directorate o f the Ministry o f Finance, and on a fee91.
for-service basis, the Bank undertook an assessment o f the Directorate’s o w n system for
evaluating government programs. The Evaluation Program (PE) o f the Directorate i s an
integral part o f budget preparation in Chile. I t forms part o f the analytic basis for budget
formulation and it provides valuable background for reviewing the budget both within the
Executive and within Congress. The Bank assessment was delivered to the government
in FY05 and entitled “Chile: Estudio de Evaluacidn de Impact0 del Programa de
Evaluacidn de Programas”. I t concluded that, overall, the PE was well structured and
well managed by the Budget Directorate. I t follows procedures and employs
methodologies that are commendably straightforward. Nevertheless the study put
forward a number o f recommendations that would h r t h e r strengthen the already
impressive achievements o f the PE. I t recommended that program evaluations should
indicate more explicitly the extent to which program results advance the strategic
objectives o f the government. I t also suggested that the ministries and agencies whose
programs are being evaluated should be more closely involved in the process so that they
may internalize the results o f the evaluations more readily. I t also proposed that, from
time to time, there should be spot checks o f specific program evaluations by external

81

consultants. In undertaking this task, the Bank was able to draw upon i t s o w n broad and
deep experience o f program and project evaluation, as well as i t s intimate knowledge o f
the Chilean budgetary system. The report was received with great interest by the Chilean
authorities who agreed to i t s publication. It i s s t i l l too early to see adjustments made as a
result o f the Bank study. The government has indicated its intention to associate
ministries and agencies more closely with the PE through a system o f certification
whereby ministries and agencies that follow sound procedures will be able to undertake
program evaluations o n their o w n account. The government has also acknowledged the
need to better integrate the PE system o f the Ministry o f Finance ‘with policy and
program evaluations undertaken by the Presidency itself, although the modalities o f that
integration are s t i l l to be determined. Lastly, the government i s moving forward to
extend the PE system to the regional and municipal levels.

Modernization o f the justice system

92.
Reference has already been made under Pillar I1 o f the C A S program to analytic
work undertaken by the Bank o n issues o f gender. Complementary to that analytic work
finance was mobilized in 2003 f i o m the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) in support
o f capacity building for legal practitioners in gender equality. Working with SERNAM,
the government department for women’s affairs, and with the University o f Chile, the
aim o f this ongoing initiative i s to strengthen the r u l e o f law and address issues o f access
to justice in Chile by: (i)
enhancing skills through clinical programs for practitioners and
policy makers, including training institutes, law schools, NGOs and representatives o f
SERNAM, the judiciary and other state agencies; (ii)
helping integrate international law
into domestic legal practice and law enforcement; and (iii)establish a national
community o f practice for the promotion and defense o f women’s human rights.
Supervision reports indicate that progress with all these activities i s highly satisfactory.
The curriculum and the clinical program have been completed and the establishment o f a
network o f practitioners i s under implementation and proceeding well. Overall, this
initiative is contributing significantly to the modernization o f the state. In addition,
gender concerns are being effectively introduced into municipal programs, thereby
fulfilling an explicit performance indicator o f the 2002 CAS. The Bank’s assessment o f
the government’s plan for equal opportunities between women and men directly assisted
in that respect.
Decentralization

93.

Municipal government was a major focus o f the 2002 CAS in terms o f
modernizing the state. In that context, an important instrument o f Bank support was a
Second Municipal Development Project (PROFIM-II) for which a U S $ 10.1 m i l l i o n loan
had been approved prior to the CAS. The closing date for this loan had originally been
designated as June 2002, but the government requested an extension so that the program
could be expanded to the 100 poorest municipalities in Chile and seventeen additional
municipal associations in addition to the original five. During the last two years o f
project implementation, particularly important advances were made towards achieving
and consolidating project objectives. Those objectives were to improve local governance

82

and efficiency in the provision o f public services by strengthening the capacity o f (i)
the
central government to formulate, implement and monitor decentralization policies and
programs; and (ii)municipalities in such areas as municipal planning, financial and
human resource management, and the management o f health and education services.
94.
The operation had wide coverage, reaching 125 municipalities and 22 municipal
associations. That i s equivalent to 37 percent o f all municipalities in the country and to
the totality o f municipal associations. Many more municipalities benefited indirectly
through sub-projects implemented by municipal associations - affecting close to 200
municipalities in all. There were innovative nation-wide competitions for some subprojects which attracted submissions from 271 municipalities. The overall project
experience clearly demonstrated that there is a strong interest for institutional
development at the local level.
The national component o f PROFIM-II amply achieved all i t s objectives. Major
95.
milestones included the implantation o f a National Municipal Information System
(SINIM) which now incorporates data from all 341 municipalities compared with the
original goal o f 21 selected municipalities. A municipal budgetary manual has been
prepared together with corresponding software and training has been given to 87 percent
o f all municipalities compared with the original goal o f 85 percent. Several studies were
successfully concluded including an assessment o f the equity and efficiency o f municipal
transfers for health, education and infrastructure which resulted in a plan o f action being
agreed between the Ministries o f Health and Education.
Progress o f the municipal component was also satisfactory particularly with
96.
respect to the poorest municipalities. Some 7 19 sub-projects were implemented during
the extension phase o f the project and they are already showing an impact by
strengthening municipal capacity in key areas such as planning, budgeting, human
resource management and customer service as well as the provision o f services by the
100 poorest municipalities. As a result o f the extension phase, there i s now one computer
for every two employees in the 100 poorest municipalities compared with a ratio o f 1:3
for the country as a whole. On average nine out o f every ten municipalities have
effectively incorporated information technology into the day-to-day operations compared
with only two municipalities before the extension phase o f the program was
implemented. There i s also an improvement in the provision o f social programs and
subsidies being administered by municipalities in terms o f both time savings and lower
operating costs.

97.
A separate component o f the project (financed with a US$200,000 grant from a
Japanese trust fund) was an initiative focusing on family, community and municipal
strengthening in areas with a focus on gender. Implementation was judged to be highly
satisfactory in the I C R and i t had a substantial impact on the three pilot municipalities,
Talcahuano, San Bemardo and Punta Arenas. I t was a catalyst for the collaboration o f
key government and non-government agencies which led to family services being
modified to make them more client-oriented and responsive to the needs o f beneficiaries.

83

98.
The base-case lending program in the 2002 CAS envisaged a Bank-supported
operation in FY05 for local service delivery that would follow-up on the previous
experience. Meanwhile, however, the government has now fully internalized PROFIM
and continues to carry i t forward as an integral part o f i t s ordinary operations. Additional
Bank support was, therefore, no longer sought in that area.
Information Technology

99.
Chile i s widely acknowledged as a leader in Latin America with respect to the
adoption o f information technology. The Bank has been supportive with analytic work in
such areas as extending broadband connectivity to rural areas. In an operational context
i t has also supported the design and implementation o f systems such as the Integrated
Financial Management System (SIGFE) and the above mentioned National Municipal
Information System (SINIM). Significant progress has been made towards meeting many
o f the performance indicators specified in the 2002 CAS. Information i s made available
to the Executive and to Congress o n budget execution every thirty days. Significant
progress has been made with e-government and an estimated 90 percent o f tax returns are
filed on-line.
Chile i s a very active participant in the Bank-sponsored Global
Development Learning Network (GDLN) with the University o f Chile as the country
hub. Some 260 tertiary level education institutions in Chile participate in the GDLN.
Through the GDLN participating institutions have access to many programs structured
for distance learning. As far as primary and secondary education are concerned, as early
as the mid-nineties the Ministry o f Education introduced a program known as Enlaces
whereby every school throughout Chile i s supplied with computers, an internet
connection and teacher training to effectively integrate I C T into the educational process.
The only schools that are not yet served by Enlaces are those in remote rural areas which
still lack adequate power and telephone infrastructure. The government i s aiming at
universal coverage for all schools in Chile and the Bank i s supporting that objective
through an Infrastructure for Territorial Development project. In 2002, the government
broadened the outreach o f Enlaces by making the hardware, software and instruction
facilities available to the general public outside o f school hours.

84

Part C: Overall Bank Performance and Lessons Learned
The Bank Contribution

100. The considerable advances in growth and equity achieved during the CAS period
were clearly attributable to the diligent implementation by the Government o f a well
structured program o f policy reform. The contribution o f the Bank was to be supportive
o f the Government’s program in selective areas where the broad international experience
o f the Bank could usefully be harnessed in a supportive role.
101. In broad terms the Bank was successful in helping the government move forward
with i t s development agenda although the operational modalities have sometimes differed
from those envisaged in the CAS. That, however, does not reflect negatively on either
the Bank or the client. In the final paragraph o f the 2002 CAS it was noted that “One o f
the lessons from the past i s that there should be flexibility in responding to changing
country needs”. The experience o f the Bank in Chile since then reconfirms that lesson
and it reflects well upon the Bank and the client that both were able to adopt a flexible
approach while keeping broad development objectives clearly in sight.
102. In Attachment 1, outcomes are summarized for each o f the three pillars o f Bank
assistance, using as a template the Program Matrix o f the 2002 CAS. Attachment 3
contains a comparison o f programmed and actual AAA, while Attachment 4 contains a
similar comparison o f programmed lending with actual lending.
103. Table 2 below on portfolio performance and management reveals an excellent
record o f project execution with no problem projects registered throughout the entire
CAS period. The program was small but strategically focused on selected areas where
the Bank could maximize i t s contribution. Only one o f the major operations planned in
the CAS, a Watershed Management Project, was prepared but not appraised and the
government implemented many o f the proposed components o n i t s own account. A
planned Local Service Delivery Project was implemented without Bank assistance.
Consistent with the flexible approach adopted in the CAS, additional projects in science
and education were included in the program in accordance with country requirements.
104. The program o f AAA delivered was much more extensive than envisaged in the
CAS. That reflected the dynamic nature o f the Bank’s dialogue with the government in
which new ideas would emerge and be acted upon. The Policy Notes that were delivered
to the incoming Bachelet administration in March 2006 incorporated many o f the main
messages from previous analytic work, particularly the two volume Development Policy
Review o f 2005. Some o f the analytic work undertaken by the Bank has been pathbreaking as in the “Management o f Contingency Liabilities from Transport
Concessions”. In other cases the Bank was in a unique position to assemble a wide
spectrum o f international expertise as in the Financial Sector Assessment which was a
joint product o f the Bank and the IMF.

105. An internal Bank assessment o f country AAA undertaken in Chile focused mainly
o n the FY03-04 period under the 2002 CAS, paying special attention to effectiveness and
quality within the context o f the country program. That assessment by the QAG unit o f
the Bank rated the AAA program as highly satisfactory in terms o f i t s strategic relevance
and likely impact. I t noted that the program was characterized by a close engagement
with the client and a high degree o f client satisfaction. I t also noted that some o f the
tasks were noteworthy for the innovative nature o f their conceptual framework, for policy
design and program implementation.

106. I t i s noteworthy that the high quality o f AAA was accomplished without undue
cost to the Bank. The data in table 3 below indicates that the average cost o f AAA was in
line with other comparator countries.

Lessons learned

107. Reference has already been made to the final paragraph o f the 2002 CAS where i t
i s stated that “One o f the lessons from the past i s that there should be flexibility in
responding to changing country needs”. Experience from the 2002 CAS confirms that
lesson and indicates that there are multiple facets to the principle o f flexibility that should
be applied. Recently, the Bank has adopted guidelines for increased CAS flexibility for
well-performing middle income countries.
Lesson: The experience o f implementing the 2002 CAS suggests that a flexible
CAS i s an appropriate way to structure the Bank’s program in Chile. I t has
already led to positive outcomes. Innovative thinking i s an important facet o f
flexibility.
108. I t has proven very difficult to separate out clearly the contribution o f the Bank to
overall country outcomes. Indicators the attribute results to the Bank program o f support
are difficult to design and monitor.
0

Lesson: In middle income countries such as Chile, the Bank should acknowledge
that CAS outcomes primarily reflect the efforts o f the Government and the
country.

The relationship between AAA and Bank lending has followed a clear path in
109.
Chile. Many o f the most successhl cases o f partnership with the Government have
begun with AAA on policy matters which pointed the way to actionable reforms. A
convenient way to take the reform program forward has been for the Bank and the
Government to structure a project with Bank finance which then serves as a framework
for implementation. The project structure and the disciplined procedures associated with

87

that structure have been helpful to the Government even though i t had no need to borrow
for purposes o f resource transfer.
0

Lesson: The symbiotic role o f AAA and lending should continue to be used as a
framework for developing a program o f Bank support in Chile.

110. Some o f the most successful AAA has been innovative in its conceptual
framework and methodology. Examples are the work done o n contingent liabilities and
on policies for the Zonas Extremas.
0

Lesson: The Bank should be open to new ideas and new approaches for AAA and
for lending operations corresponding to the needs o f a middle income country that
aspires to convergence with the OECD in the medium-term.

111. Projects supported by Bank lending sometimes encountered problems o f
contracting and procurement which reflected the view o f the Chilean authorities that their
own procurement procedures are well developed and effective.
0

Lesson: The Bank should focus on streamlining i t s contracting and procurement
requirements and should incorporate country systems to the extent possible.

112. In many cases Bank assistance has effectively mobilized international expertise
on key development issues o f interest to Chile. Analytic work that has been undertaken
jointly with other international organizations such as the IMF, the IDB and the OECD has
been well received in Chile. That includes a financial sector assessment, a country
financial accountability assessment and a country gender assessment.
0

Lesson: The Bank should continue to work closely with other international
agencies in i t s program o f assistance to Chile.

113. In several instances country outcomes f e l l short o f the country performance
indicators set out in the 2002 CAS. In retrospect, it would appear that the country
performance indicators were overly ambitious in that they did not allow sufficient time
for government action to work i t s way through the system before producing results on the
ground.
0

Lesson: Country performance indicators should be readily measurable and based
upon a realistic assessment o f likely outcomes taking explicit account o f lags
between action and measurable results. More frequent household surveys would
allow for a better evaluation o f social programs.
