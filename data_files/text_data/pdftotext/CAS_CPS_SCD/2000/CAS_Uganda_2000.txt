INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION

TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP FOR
THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Over a decade ago, PresidentMuseveni's Government inherited a country in economic and
social shambles, with practically all economic and social indicators portraying an abysmal
picture. Given this background, Uganda's economic performance over the last decade has been
impressive. The average real rate of GDP growth has been about 6.9 percent per annum,
resulting in an annual 3.7 percent increase in real GDP per capita. Consumer price inflation has
fallen from 24.6 percent in 1990/91 to -0.2 percent in 1998/99. The Government's reform
program has had considerable success in establishing fiscal discipline, restructuring public
expenditure, opening up the economy and anchoring its reliance on market forces. Also, there
has been a significant reduction in the country's debt overhang, as a result of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Uganda was the first country to reach a completion
point and to access the original HIPC initiative in April 1998 and the enhanced HIPC initiative in
May 2000, respectively. More significantly, there is clear evidence that the country's high
economic growth and poverty reduction efforts have yielded positive results. According to the
Government's household surveys, there has been a clear and impressive decline in poverty
(headcount index) of more than 20 percent over the five years since 1992.
2.
This impressive progress notwithstanding, with 44 percent of the population remaining
below the poverty line, poverty remains a major issue; its eradication is the number one priority
on the country's development agenda. Maintaining growth at levels sufficient to reduce poverty
will require addressing the remaining constraints to growth, especially, impediments to private
sector development. Moreover, despite the substantial increase in the government's resources
allocated for social services, there has been less than commensurate progress in social and human
development. Though most key education and health indicators have improved in the past
decade, almost all the social indicators are still worse than average in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
main challenge in the education sector is quality. In health, the major issues are limited
availability and poor quality of health services, adult mortality and life expectancy which are
adversely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, Uganda is one of the first countries in
Africa where the incidence of HIWV/AIDS is declining as a result of the country's aggressive
response to the epidemic.
3.
The previous country assistance strategy (CAS) was considered by the Board in April
1997. It focused on poverty reduction through accelerated growth, and emphasized continued
macroeconomic stability and increased analytic work to facilitate policy formulation and
determine investment priorities. This CAS for FY01 -03 seeks to build on the previous CAS by
reinforcing its focus on poverty reduction through sustained growth. The CAS was developed in
consultation with the Government, private sector, civil society and other donors. Its over-arching
objective is to support Uganda's economic transformation and poverty reduction strategy spelled
out in the Governrnrnt's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)/Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). While the work to maintain macroeconomic stability will continue, in the period
ahead emphasis in assistance will shift to the sector level and cross-cutting public sector
management issues. Effectively addressing these issues and facilitating economic transformation

i

calls for broadening of the decision-making process to involve all key stakeholders, particularly
the sector ministries and civil society. Secondly, it calls for a change in the Bank's lending
modalities. This would entail moving away from the traditional combination of adjustment
operations with discrete investment projects, to supporting a comprehensive reform program
through the government's budget, via a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). In
addition to PRSCs, the Bank would continue supporting some self-standing projects for capacity
building and infrastructure investments directly targeted to poverty alleviation and private sector
development. IFC expects to increase substantially its support for Uganda's private sector
development agenda through increased investments focusing on infrastructure, SMEs, and
agriculture/agribusiness advisory assistance and capacity building.
4.
Only two economic scenarios are considered in the Bank Group's strategy over the next
three years: the high case and low case. Based on Uganda's track record, the Bank and
Government consider the assumption of Uganda continuing in the high case scenario realistic.
This scenario is consistent with the Government's program supported by the IMF's Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Moreover, if the Government is to achieve its poverty
reduction objective, it has to continue operating in this scenario. Under this scenario, GDP is
projected to grow up to seven percent per annum with annual inflation rates of about five percent.
International reserves would be maintained at a level equivalent to about five months of imports
of goods and services. Under the scenario, IDA commitments during the three-year CAS period
would total about US$ 1.I billion.
5.
Falling to the low case could result from a deteriorated intemal security situation and/or
the country being drawn deeper into regional conflicts, leading to diversion of public funds for
defense purposes and decline in growth. It could also occur if government pursued adverse
economic policies, pushing the macroeconomic program off track. Under this scenario, GDP
would grow between 3-4 percent with an annual inflation of between 6-15 percent. Foreign
reserves would be drawn down to 2.5 to 4.0 months of imports. IDA lending program would be
reduced to a total commitment of US$300 million over the CAS period. The probability for this
case is low.
6.
There are several risks which threaten Uganda's ability to achieve its set goals. The
country is vulnerable to exogenous shocks, especially droughts, plant diseases and commodity
price changes which could affect rural incomes and export earnings. However, Uganda is
progressively diversifying its export base. In addition, the projected level of international
reserves together with the HJPC debt relief increase the country's abilities to absorb the shocks.
Other risks include institutional capacity weaknesses, corruption, HIV/AIDS and political
transition. In practically all these areas, actions are under way and/or planned to mitigate the
risks. For the Bank, the highest risk is a possible overestimation of the Government's capacity to
implement the PEAP/PRSP. However, the Bank's three-year work program is designed to help
overcome these constraints and minimize the risk. Finally, a deterioration in the security situation
is possible with attendant pressures to increase military expenditures.
7.

The following issues were suggested for Board discussion:
*

Does the Board consider that the Bank Group's proposed assistance Strategy
adequately addresses the development challenges facing Uganda?

*

Does the Board consider the Bank Group's proposed instruments, including a shift to
providing support through PRSCs, appropriate?

ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT

1.
Over the period 1971-85 both the Ugandan economy and society collapsed. By 1986, when
the National Resistance Movement (NRM) captured Kampala and formed a government, Uganda
had suffered the mismanagement of previous governments, including civil wars, mass emigration
of the skilled, and mass murder. The performance of the Ugandan economy needs to be reviewed
against this background, keeping in mind that Uganda has been and still is recovering from an
extended period of instability and disastrous economic policies.
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

A.

2.
Given the above context, Uganda's economic performance has been impressive. The
average real rate of GDP growth has been about 6.9 percent per annum since 1990/91, resulting in
an annual 3.7 percent increase in real GDP per capita (see Figure 1) and over a 20 percent decline
in poverty (headcount index) from 1992 to 1997. The annual average consumer price inflation has
fallen from 24.6 percent in 1990/91 to -0.2 percent in 1998/99 (see Figure 2). The reform program
implemented since President Museveni came to power in 1986 has aimed at establishing fiscal
discipline, opening up the economy and promoting reliance on market forces. It has been
successful in establishing fiscal discipline and restructuring public expenditure. Progress has been

made on trade liberalization, privatization, civil service and financial sector reforms and an
impressive decentralization effort is ongoing. Further, the high stock of debt that constrained
economic development in Uganda has become a smaller obstacle as a result of Uganda's
participation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative. By end-June 1997,
Uganda's net present value (NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio was 243 percent. As debt sustainability
analysis concluded that this was unsustainable, the IMF and World Bank agreed in 1997 to support
a debt reduction package under the HIPC. Uganda was the first country to reach the completion
point in April 1998. After the Interim and Development Committees endorsed enhanced relief to

HIPCs in 1999, Uganda was again the first to begin receiving additional assistance' 2 The
estimated NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is currently about 150 percent. Key macroeconomic
indicators for 1990-99 are presented in Table 1.
3.
Uganda was also the first country to present a full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
to the Boards of the Bank and IMF in May 2000.2 A summary of the Government's Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), a home-grown medium-term development plan, was used for this
purpose since the objectives and content of the PRSP and PEAP are consistent.
4.
The sustainability of high economic growth in Uganda is, however, an issue. First, the
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture (currently accounting for about 44 percent of GDP
and employing about 80 percent of the labor force) which leaves Uganda vulnerable to droughts
and plant diseases. Second, the economy is subject to comnmodity price fluctuations since
agricultural products account for nearly 100 percent of the country's merchandise exports. In
12 Total relief provided to Uganda under the original HIPC framework was about US$650 million (or
US$347 million in NPV terms). The completion point under the enhanced framework was reached in May
2000, and it is expected that assistance under the enhanced initiative will be about US$1.3 billion (or
US$656 million in NPV terms), or total relief of almost US$2 billion from the two operations.

particular, changes in coffee prices are a cause of concem because over half of Uganda's export
revenues come from coffee and Uganda's high economic growth rates in the past decade were
partially driven by high international coffee prices.3 Third, the potential for growth from
macroeconomic reforms has now been largely exploited, and therefore further economic growth
requires a broader reform agenda. Specifically, there are sectoral and difficult governance issues
which need to be effectively addressed.
An overarching consideration is that development and growth must occur in an
5.
environmentally sustainable manner, given that 90 percent of Uganda's population is directly
dependent on the country's natural resource base. Due to lack of awareness of the longer term
implications of current resource use for sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation,
economic expansion poses a threat to the integrity of Uganda's rich and diverse natural resource
base. The key environmental concerns are deforestation, soil erosion, loss of wildlife and habitat,
and the degradation and loss of prime agricultural land and wetlands through poor land
management practices. The Government has in place a legislative framework and regulatory
system to facilitate environmentally sound development and to govern the use of natural resources.
However, institutional weaknesses and governance problems have so far undernined their
enforcement.
B.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT FOR EcoNoMIc GROWTH

6.
To ensure continued high economic growth and to mitigate vulnerability to exogenous
shocks, an economic transformation is needed in Uganda. Specificaly, as underlined in the PRSP,
the modernization of agriculture and diversification into non-farm private sector activities are
critical.

There has been progress: the Govermment is pursuing a comprehensive privatization

program and has already successfully liberalized marketing of Uganda's coffee. Uganda has been
lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers to regional trade, removed all restrictions on intemational
capital transactions, and about two-thirds of Uganda's public enterprises have been privatized in the
past decade. A recent noteworthy success was the privatization of the telecommunications utility in
the spring of 2000 and the accompanying sector reform which have brought in a second national
operator and a second cellular licensee, expanding service options and lowering prices. In addition,
reforms of the power utility, airline, railways, water, and other public enterprises are ongoing.
Overall, private investment as a share of GDP has increased from 7.8 percent in 1990/91 to 11.7
percent in 1998/99.
7.
Inefficiencies in public service delivery and markets are hindering both growth and
diversification to non-farm activities. According to 1998 surveys of domestic and foreign
investors, there are four key impediments to the development of Uganda's private sector: (i)
inadequate and poor infrastructure; (ii) an underdeveloped financial sector; (iii) high levels of
corruption; and (iv) restrictive regulations, red tape and a lack of business services. In addition,
the availability of skilled labor is constraining development. The Bank Group has supported
government efforts to address critical constraints in these areas through Bank projects, IFC
advisory and technical assistance on privatization and regulatory reform in key sectors, and FIAS
work on the investment environment. However, given the complexity of these issues, progress has
been slow and further work on each area is needed.
Infrastructure. Inadequate and unreliable electricity is ranked as the most binding
8.
infrastructure constraint to growth by most domestic and foreign firms. Frequent load shedding,
However, the role of coffee in the country's export earnings has decreased from 72 percent in 1990/91 to
56 percent in 1998/99, as non-traditional agricultural exports (fish, horticultural and other agricultural
products) have grown from US$49 million in 1990/91 to US$242 million in 1998/99.

power failures and voltage fluctuations complicate production and force firms to invest in private
generators and voltage stabilizers. In addition to power, surveys indicate that the state of the
transport network, including roads and railways, poses a considerable burden on business activities
in Uganda.
Financialsector: The performance of the financial sector has improved, but access to
9.
financial services remains a problem. In 1993, the Government launched a financial sector reform
program. Under this program, weak banks were restructured, insolvent banks closed, and banking
supervision strengthened at the Bank of Uganda (BOU). The new Financial Institutions Statute
increased the capital requirements for all banks, and included provisions for prompt corrective
action by BOU for noncompliance. The reform did suffer a setback, however, when the
privatization of the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) was reversed owing to breach of contract
and other questionable practices on the part of the investor. Since then, UCB has been operating
under BOU appointed management; the Government is considering options for its re-privatization.
Given UCB's dominance in the financial sector, privatization and improved management of this
Bank is key to overall financial sector performance. As a result of reforms carried out and more
aggressive banking supervision by BOU, the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets has
fallen. However, the ratio of credit to GDP is still low: 5.6 percent of GDP, while the average for
Sub-Saharan Africa is 14 percent.

11. Legal and regulatory environment: Survey
data for foreign investors in Uganda show that
weak governance, including ineffective enforcement of laws and contracts and excessive red tape,
also seriously limits private sector growth.
Ineffective law enforcement and outdated laws,
regulations and practices in many areas create
unproductive administrative burdens on the private

sector, in addition to multiplying opportunities for
corruption. There are some signs of improvement
in these areas. Efforts to reduce "red tape" have
been partially successful, but further reforms are
still required. Indexes of the ICRG, presented in
Figure 4, suggest that the quality of bureaucracy

especially the rule of law, has been steadily improving in the past nine years.'
12. Labor markets and standards: Firms also consider lack of skilled labor to be a constraint to
their activities in Uganda. Moreover, the health status of the work force is a concern for investors:
absences from work due to prolonged illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS and malaria) or mourning are
common and have a negative effect on firm operations. Uganda has labor laws and regulations,
but their enforcement has been weak and inconsistent due to capacity constraints at different levels
of Government. The Constitution of Uganda provides for the right of every person to join
workers' associations or trade unions, and the law allows unionization if the majority of the work
force supports it. Further, the law prohibits forced or bonded labor, but the lack of resources has
prevented the Government from enforcing this prohibition effectively. Also, the law prohibits
employers from hiring workers below the age of 18. However, due to weak enforcement, child
labor is common. Most working children are employed in the informal sector, often on the
subsistence farms of extended family members or as domestic servants. Uganda is a signatory to
the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
and to the Vocational Rehabilitation Employment (Disabled Persons) Convention of 1983, though
it has not ratified yet the relevant ILO Conventions. Finally, minimum wage legislation exists, but
the minimum wage rate has not been adjusted since the 1960s.
C.

POVERTY REDUCTION

13. High economic growth in the 1990s has translated into substantial increases in the living
standards of Uganda's poor. Since 1992, the Government has been monitoring living standards
through annual household surveys. 6 The Bank and Government have cooperated in analyzing the
results of these surveys and, as noted in the PRSP, this analysis confirms that there has been a
clear and impressive decline in poverty (headcount index) of over 20 percent over the five-year
period from 1992.7 Average real household income has risen by 17 percent over the period and
expenditures of the bottom 10 percent have risen even more (by 29 percent). The income group
which has benefited most is cash crop farmers: the incidence of poverty in this group fell from 60
percent to 44 percent between 1992 and 1997. The reduction in poverty can be traced to two
factors. First, liberalization of coffee has had a fundamental impact on small-holder coffee
farmers who have directly benefited from the removal of market controls and the emergence of a
dynamic group of private traders. Second, the international coffee prices soared in the mid-1990s
and remained high for several years. The resulting increase in the returns to coffee farmers has led
to a significant number of small-holder producers moving out of poverty.
14.
In spite of this progress, poverty remains a major issue in Uganda. About 44 percent of the
population still lives below the poverty line, and the average per capita income in Uganda is only
now approaching the level achieved in 1970. The significant regional disparities in poverty are of
concern: in the central region, the incidence of poverty is 20 percent compared to 59 percent in the
northern region. Further, as pointed out in the PRSP, poverty among the largest group of the poor
in Uganda - subsistence food crop producers' - declined only marginally during the five year
period: from 64 percent in 1992 to 62 percent in 1997.

The indexes reflect the perceptions of banks, multinational companies and other institutional investors. The
quality of bureaucracy and rule of law indexes range between one and six, the higher number hidicating
better quality bureaucracy and sounder legal institutions.
6 As an exception, in 1998, the survey was not conducted due to lack of funds.
7 The poverty lines were calculated as expenditures required in order to obtain specified amounts of calories
(depending on sex and age) and to meet minimum non-food requirements.
8 In 1996, subsistence food crop producers represented 44 percent of the total population and 57 percent of
the poor population.

15. To better understand what poverty means in Uganda, the Government has supplemented
household surveys by participatory poverty assessments over the past three years. The
participatory work demonstrates that, in addition to material or income poverty, there are noneconomic dimensions to poverty that need to be addressed (see Box 1). Specifically, the poor in
Uganda are concerned with the lack of access to basic services (health care, education, safe water),
land, and production inputs. Further, they are particularly concerned about insecurity (in terms of
the presence of wars, rebel activity, cattle raiding and theft) and corruption. The comments made
by the poor clearly highlight that corruption does not only increase the cost of doing business, but
has a broader detrimental effect by constraining the access of the poor to public services.

PROGRESS IN SOCLAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

D.

16. Despite the macroeconomic success and significant increases in government resources
devoted to social services, progress in social and human development in Uganda has been
relatively modest (see Annex B5). Though most education and health indicators have improved in
the past decade, almost all Uganda's social indicators, except primary school enrollment rates,
remain worse than average in Sub-Saharan Africa.
17. Education: The government policy of Universal Primary Education (UPE) that was
initiated in 1997 has more than doubled the number of children in primary schools, to over six
million. The policy has been successful in providing primary education throughout the country
and reaching the poorest groups. However, as the PRSP made clear, the Government recognizes
that the quality of education remains an acute problem: pupil-teacher, pupil-classroom ratios and
dropout rates are high in government-aided primary schools. While past public expenditure
tracking surveys indicated that a relatively small portion of non-wage funding reached schools,
this situation has dramatically improved in recent years. Budgeted fumds reaching schools have
increased from 20 percent in 1995 to over 90 percent in 2000. This was a result of, among other
things, Government using media and notice boards at schools. Reform in the tertiary education
sector has led to increased enrollment and dramatically increased resource mobilization, reestablishing the Makerere University as a leading institution in the region.
18. Health and HIV/AIDS: Adult mortality rates and life expectancy, have been adversely
affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 9 Uganda's aggressive response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic
has, however, resulted in Uganda being one of the first countries in Africa where national HIV
prevalence is declining. At the end of 1999, HIV prevalence in the adult population (age 15-49)
was 8.3 percent; this proportion was as high as 15 percent in 1993. The largest decline is in the

HIV prevalence among young people (age 15-19) which dropped from 32 percent in 1992 to 10
percent in 1998. Once number one in the world for HIV infection, Uganda has today dropped to
number 14. This success in reducing HIV prevalence clearly reflects the impact of Government
policy and its commitment to fight the epidemic (see Box 2). Despite this progress, however, the
number of people infected with HIV/AIDS is still high (802,000 people) and the number of
H1V/AIDS orphans remains a staggering 1.1 million.
19.
Other health indicators have improved. As detailed in the PRSP, infant mortality rates have
fallen; the decline has been particularly rapid among the poorest quintile of the population.
Immunization rates have also improved: for instance, rates for measles and DPT have jumped to
60 percent and 58 percent of children under one year of age, compared to 17 percent and 14
percent, respectively, in the mid-1980s.' 0 The percentage of the population with access to safe
water has risen from 16 to 41. However, child mortality among the poorest quintile of the
population has persisted at high levels.
20. Gender: Gender disparities in participation in policy-making and in access to services have
also decreased. The Government has implemented a far-reaching affirmative action program to
promote women's political participation. National and local elective offices have been reserved
for women, and the number of women holding seats in Parliament has risen. A woman is now the
Vice President of Uganda and about 30 percent of ministerial posts are currently held by women.
The UPE initiative has corrected the gender disparities in primary school enrollment: primary
school enrollments are currently divided almost equally between boys and girls. The existing
statistics indicate that there is no striking gender disparity in the access to basic health services.
21. However, other gender inequalities remain. The subsistence food crop farmers that
constitute the largest group of the poor in Uganda are predominantly women. Women provide in
aggregate 75 percent of total agricultural labor and over 80 percent of labor in food crop and nontraditional export sectors. Even though the farmer in Uganda is typically a woman, the current
legal framework constrains women's access to land: when husbands die, the wife often looses the
rights to the land. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, by increasing adult mortality rates, has made this
problem particularly acute. In addition, the spread of HIV/AIDS has placed particularly heavy
burden on women who are typically responsible for caring for the sick.
E.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

22. The 1996 Presidential election came one decade afterMuseveni rose to leadership. In that
election, which observers confirmed was fair and open, he received almost 75 percent of the votes.
The 1996 Parliamentary election ushered in a very active Parliament determined to play its
legislative role and more effectively exert executive oversight. In particular, Parliament is now
taking a more active role in scrutinizing proposed foreign borrowing.
23. Uganda continues to operate under a "movement system", where people compete for
election as individuals under the umbrella of the National Resistance Movement (NRM);
traditional parties have been banned from operating, even though many in the political leadership
have been associated with parties in the past. A Referendum on whether multiparty democracy
should be allowed or whether the present system should be maintained was provided for under the
1995 Constitution and held in June 2000. An overwhelming majority of nearly 90 percent

supported the continuation of the "movement system." Although there was some criticism about
the Government's management of the Referendum and participation was lower than in the 1996
elections, Uganda's development partners have generally accepted its constitutionality and results.
The traditional political parties, including the Democratic Party (DP) and the Uganda People's
Congress (UPC), boycotted the Referendum and do not recognize its results. Both parties have
sued the Government and are challenging the legitimacy of both the Referendum and the enabling
legislation. The important question which will continue to be an issue during the CAS period is
whether and how the political system will evolve. PresidentMuseveni has indicated that the issue
of opening up the system to political parties can be reconsidered in the future. It is likely that this
issue will re-emerge after the Presidential and Parliamentary elections next year.
24. Security remains a serious development constraint, as the participatory poverty work has
demonstrated. The strife in Northern Uganda has continued. An opposition group, the Lord's
Resistance Army, continues to attack civilian targets from bases in Southern Sudan and conflicts
have occurred in Western Uganda between government forces and opposition groups. Insecurity
constrains economic activities in both of these areas. In an effort to address the internal security
issues, Parliament has passed amnesty legislation, which provides for forgiveness for all rebels
who agree to lay down their arms and abjure future violence. In addition, PresideniMuseveni and
President Bashir of Sudan signed a peace accord in late 1998, brokered by former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter. Progress in implementing the accord has, however, been slow.
25. In addition, Uganda's involvement in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) has emerged as an issue. The original justifications for Uganda's and Rwanda's
involvement were security concerns and threats against minority groups, but the issue has become
more complex with the entry of other regional powers into the conflict. Donors have become
increasingly concerned that increased defense spending will divert resources from the
development effort, that Uganda's involvement in the DRC will not be easy to bring to closure,
and that the aftermath could be difficult to manage. Uganda has committed itself to enforcing the
Lusaka Peace Agreement withdrawing some 5,000 troops and accepting international
peacekeepers. However, the recent clashes with its erstwhile ally, Rwanda, and the lack of a
commitment to the Lusaka Agreement by some participants are of concern.

2. THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY
A.

THE POVERTY ERADICATION ACTION PLAN AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
PAPER

26.
Government's strategy for economic transformation is spelled out in the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The PEAP is a medium-term development plan to guide
government policy and the development of detailed sector and district plans. The initial PEAP,
which was a result of an 18-month long participatory process involving all key stakeholders, was
prepared in 1997. A revised PEAP was finalized in the spring 2000.
27. The overarching goal of the PEAP is to develop policies and resource allocations aimed at
reducing the incidence of poverty (headcount index) in Uganda from 44 percent in 1997 to 10
percent or less by the year 2017. In addition, the PEAP sets forth the specific goals of achieving
universal access to primary education, primary health care, safe drinking water, guaranteeing
political freedom and human rights and establishing an effective disaster relief system targeted
principally at the poor.

9

28. As noted earlier, because thePEAP's objectives are fully consistent with those of the PRSP
process, a summary of the revised PEAP was used as a basis for Uganda's PRSP that was
presented to the Boards of the Bank and IMF in May 2000. According to the PRSP analysis, the
Govermment's goal to reduce poverty to ten percent or less by 2017 can be achieved if the real
GDP grows at seven percent per annum and the growth is equally distlibuted. As will be
discussed later in Section 4, this growth rate, though high, is attainable in Uganda. The joint staff
assessment of the PRSP underlined that it provides an excellent framework for the Government's
attack on poverty, though it did point out that further work on monitoring indicators and costing of
activities is needed. Since then output targets for education, health, agricultural extension and
water have been defined and preliminary costing estimates of activities to reach the targets have
been prepared. Further work in these areas is, however, needed.
29.
Government's strategy for economic transformation and poverty eradication is based on
four key pillars: (i) directly increasing the ability of the poor to raise their incomes; (ii) directly
increasing the quality of life of the poor; (iii) creating an enabling environment for economic
growth and structural transformation; and (iv) ensuring good govemance and security. The
specific actions to be taken under each pillar are as follows:
(i)

Directly increasingthe ability of the poor to raisetheir incomes

30. As most Ugandans live in rural areas and earn their living from agriculture, increasing
agricultural growth rates, diversifying agricultural production and expanding non-farm
employment in rural areas are essential for poverty reduction. The first pillar therefore focuses on
actions to promote ruraldevelopment. As detailed in the PEAP/PRSP, the Government's Plan for
Modemization of Agriculture (PMA) provides the strategic and operational framework for
environmentally sustainable rural development and agricultural transformation from subsistence to
commercial agriculture. Although it does not provide a detailed plan of action, it does describe the
types of interventions required to promote rural development (including rural roads, markets, and
water), define the responsibilities of the public sector, private sector and civil society in this effort
and outline participatory processes through which packages of interventions will be designed. The
vision of the PMA is of a competitive, dynamic and sustainable agricultural and agro-industrial
sector. The PMA aims to increase incomes and improve the quality of life of subsistence food
crop producers that are mostly women and form the largest group of the poor as well as ensure
food security and create gainful employment. Accordingly, the PMA identifies six core areas for
public action in agriculture and rural development: research and technology, advisory services,
education for agriculture, providing a framework for rural finance, access to markets and
sustainable natural resource utilization and management. It includes further strengthening of land
rights and land administration to ensure equal access to land.
(ii)

Directly increasingthe quality of life of the poor

31. As the participatory poverty work indicates (see Box 1 in Section 1), public services, in
particularprimary education, health care and potable water and sanitation,have a direct impact
on the quality of life of the poor. Consequently, their delivery is a central element of the
PEAP/PRSP. In the education sector, the Government plans to continue emphasizing the delivery
of quality universal primary education (UPE) by providing the necessary infrastructure and
teachers, while also developing a strategy for post-primary education. Government's National
Health Policy and Heaith Sector Strategic Plan (HS SP) will continue guiding the delivery of public
health care. At the heart of this plan is the minimum health package which includes the most
important and most easily treatable diseases. The plan also attempts to strengthen health care
delivery and ensure equal access to health services. The National Strategic Framework for
HIV/AIDS Activities (2000/1-2005/6) will guide the work to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, to
10

mitigate its effects on households and communities and to strengthen the national capacity to
respond to it. According to the results of the participatory poverty work, one of the key
development priorities of the poor is to increase the access to safe water. Responding to this need,
the PEAP/PRSP sets as a goal sustainable provision of accessible, safe water and sanitation
facilities to the entire rural population.
(iii)

Creatingan enabling environmentfor economic growth and structuraltransformation

32. As emphasized above, continued high economic growth in Uganda requires aframework
within which the private sector can expand Actions listed under this pillar aim to provide that
framework. Specifically, the Government intends to address three key elements: (i)
macroeconomic stability, without which economic growth will not be sustainable; (ii) the removal
of constraints on private sector competitiveness. Government's "Medium-Term Competitive
Strategy for the Private Sector (2000-2004)" guides action in this area" (see Box 3 for further
details); and (iii) equitable and efficient collection and use ofpublic resources,involving further
strengthening of budget processes, a review of the local taxation to make it more progressive, and
gradual introduction of equalization grants to make the delivery of public services more balanced
across the country.

Ensuringgood governance and security

33.
Finally, good governance and security are essential for making progress in the first three
pillars. Actions detailed under the fourth pillar focus onimproving public service delivery and
decentralization; reducing corruption; ensuring law and order and security; and providing
disaster management. To improve the service delivery on the ground, Government has
decentralized the delivery of health, education, water and agricultural extension services to local
11 Uganda is not yet fully integrated into the multilateral trading system. Further work to harmonize the
country's trade policy and regulatory framework with WTO agreements is needed. To facilitate that work,
the Government has developed an integrated framework for trade related technical assistance to coordinate
donor assistance.

governments. The key challenge facing this effort is improving the capacities of local
governments for effective planning, management, and implementation of related policies and
programs. The Government plans to address these concerns by the introduction of results-oriented
management, pay reform and by strengthening bottom-up accountability. Some of these actions
are expected to address the pervasive corruption plaguing public service delivery by diminishing
opportunities for misconduct. To reduce corruption, the Government also plans to implement the
revised Plan of Action (Government Strategy and Plan of Action to Fight Corruption and Build
Ethics and Integrity in Public Office 2000-2002). Actions to be undertaken under that plan include
the implementation of public procurement reform, enforcement of the Leadership Code,
strengthening the role of the Auditor General and other enforcement agencies, a review of the legal
framework relating to corruption, and nurturing and empowering civil society to monitor and hold
Government accountable. Further, to improve law and order and security, the Government plans
to launch a criminal justice sector reform; seek a resolution of the remaining internal and regional
conflicts; and develop a national strategy to improve the country's ability to respond to disasters
(such as drought, floods and conflict).

B.

PEAP/PRSP IMPLEMENTATION, MEDIUM TERM EXPENDITURE FRAMEWORK AND
COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

34. The PEAP/PRSP is the Government's overall development strategy and elaborates the
Ugandan Government's approach to the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF). This
approach is then articulated in more detail in sector and district plans (see Figure in Annex 1 for a
summary of the planning process). These plans are prepared by sector and district working groups
that convene regularly to discuss actions and set priorities within the sector or district over the
medium term in the context of the PEAP/PRSP. In addition to government officials, donors,
NGOs and private sector representatives participate regularly and actively in these groups. The
sector and district plans prepared will guide the sectoral and district expenditure allocations.
35. Since 1997/98, the Government has utilized the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) to allocate resources and better align the spending priorities articulated in the
PEAP/PRSP and in sector and district plans. Another key objective of the MTEF is to ensure
medium-term financial stability by coordinating the allocation of all public expenditure in a
framework that ensures consistency with overall resource constraints. The MTEF sets sector and
district spending ceilings within a rolling three-year framework (the first year being the annual
budget), taking into consideration the macroeconomic environment and prospects for revenue
mobilization. Subsequently the sector and district working groups discuss budget options within
these expenditure ceilings to meet sector and district priorities. This process culminates in
working groups preparing sectoral and district Budget Framework Papers (BFP) that are ultimately
consolidated into the MTEF.
36. The MTEF is intended to guide all public expenditure decisions, including the use of
resources committed by donors. For this reason, the Government is introducing a sector-wide
approach, wherever feasible, under which Government and donors contribute to a common pool of
resources used to achieve sector objectives. Sector-wide plans/strategies have already been
developed in education, health, rural development, and main roads. Annex 2 summarizes the
status of different sector plans.
37. Within the MTEF, the Government has created a Poverty Action Fund (PAF) to ensure that
increased funds are allocated to poverty reducing services specified in the PEAP/PRSP. Initially,
the PAF was created to "ring-fence" HIPC debt relief for basic services in 1998. Subsequently,
the PAF has attracted additional donor funding and has in practice become a mechanism for
ensuring the reallocation of the incremental expenditures directly to poverty reducing services
12

including primary education, primary health care, agricultural extension, feeder roads,
water/sanitation, and law and order. About five percent of PAF resources are used for monitoring
and evaluation purposes. Overall, the budget and planning process in Uganda has improved
considerably over the past five years.
38. As noted above, the implementation of the PEAP/PRSP (and related PAF) provides the
central mechanism to operationalize Uganda's approach to the CDF. Work on the CDF in Uganda
has focused on three issues: (i) providing a govermment-led and owned comprehensive framework
for donor intervention; (ii) improving partnerships among the Government, donors, civil society
and private sector; and (iii) addressing capacity constraints. More specifically, the PEAP/PRSP
provides a framework for government actions and donor interventions towards common goals, and
specifies the actions that Government and donors have agreed to take. Box 4 discusses further the
CDF approach in Uganda.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP'S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

39. The previous CAS of 1997 for Uganda focused on poverty reduction and the importance of
continued work on the macroeconomic front. In addition, it sought to increase the emphasis on
analytic work to guide policies and investment priorities. As a result, a fair amount of analytic
work has been carried out and the Bank Group's assistance program has been increasingly
focusing on poverty reduction over the last three years.
A.

OBJECTIVE OF THE 2000 CAS

40. This CAS for FYO1-03 seeks to build on the previous CAS by emphasizing poverty
reduction and high-quality analytic work. Reflecting this, the CAS is the Bank Group's business
plan to support Uganda's economic transformation and poverty reduction strategy as spelled out in
the PEAP/PRSP. To achieve this objective, work to maintain macroeconomic stability will
continue, but in the period ahead the focus of Bank's assistance will increasingly shift to the sector
level and to cross-cutting public sector management issues. In parallel, IFC will support key
private sector initiatives which can reduce poverty. Over this CAS period, the key challenge in
13

Uganda will be to replicate the excellent policy and implementation record on the macroeconomic
front at the sector level to facilitate economic transformation and poverty eradication.
B.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST BANK GROUP ACTWITIES

41. This CAS builds on analysis of recent economic developments, and on the lessons learned
from the implementation of the past Bank Group activities in Uganda. Specifically, the CAS is
shaped by: (i) lessons learned from the implementation of the past Bank assistance strategy and
IFC's experience as an investor and advisor; (ii) the results of the 1999 Client Survey and (iii) the
results of OED's recently completed Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE). Annex 3 provides a
detailed discussion of the results of the Client Survey and CAE.
What worked:
*

The Bank's emphasis on poverty and related analytic work has greatly enhanced
understanding of poverty in Uganda and supported other donors' increased emphasis on
poverty reduction in their assistance strategies. The PEAP/PRSP, which involved close
interaction between Government, civil society, donors and the Bank during its preparation,
has emerged as a central strategy document in Uganda. At the same time, the results of
the Client Survey propose even greater focus on poverty in future Bank assistance.

*

Macroeconomic work has paid significant dividends and economic growth has resulted in
a significant reduction in poverty. Both the Client Survey and CAE rate the Bank's
assistance in this area as highly effective.

*

Bank's support to the government's budget process has strengthened the MTEF process
which is now central to govemment resource allocation decisions. Moreover, the Bank
has worked very closely with the Government in opening up the budget process to civil
society and the donor community. As a result, budgetary decisions are made in an
increasingly participatory manner and budgetary allocations to poverty-reducing activities
have increased significantly.

*

The donor community has worked together to build a more open CG process and
improved coordination has led to improved cooperation among Uganda's development
partners. The Govemnment has been able to draw on this partnership in its formulation of
plans.

*

Bank Group support for private sector development has had some successes. In particular,
IFC played a key role in the transformation of the telecommunications sector by
supporting the first cellular operator and advising the Govemnment on sector reforms and
privatization, which have contributed to an expansion of services in the sector.

What did not work:
*

As discussed earlier, though improving, most social indicators (except primary school
enrollments) in Uganda are lower than average in Sub-Saharan Africa. The impact of
increased spending on social and human development has been less than anticipated partly
due to problems in public service delivery. The Bank's assistance must continue to focus
on addressing these inefficiencies.

*

With hindsight, the Bank should have pushed the work on rural development and on the
PMA further upstream in the reform/assistance process. As discussed in previous
sections, given that the majority of Uganda's poor are rural and work in agriculture,
increased focus on rural development is central to sustained poverty reduction.
Implementation of the PMA is now urgent.
14

C.

•

Both the CAE and the Client Survey call for increased anti-corruption efforts by the Bank
given that corruption is constraining private sector development and undermining the
access of the poor to social and other services. Though Govemment's actions on
increasing transparency in fiscal management, enhancing accountability and combating
corruption have been impressive, the continuing corruption and other govemance
problems are keeping intemal and external partners dissatisfied.

*

Despite explicit Bank Group support, several key reforms related to private sector
development remain incomplete. These include the privatization of UCB and sector
reform and private participation in key infrastructure sectors, such as power. Both these
areas did not reach critical milestones in the past CAS period and thus need to be further
addressed during this CAS period.
STRATEGIC ELEMENTS OF THE CAS

42. The lessons learned - specifically the substantial progress in macroeconomic policy and
weaker policy and implementation performance at the sector level - point to the need to refocus
the Bank's assistance on sectoral and cross-cutting public sector management issues. Weaknesses
in service delivery are among the key constraints to economic transformation and poverty
reduction in Uganda. Basic services (such as electricity, roads, health care) that are critical inputs
to development are inadequate. In addition, the services delivered, in particular by the public
sector, are of poor quality due to various governance problems and capacity constraints.
Addressing these problems effectively requires interventions at the sector level (including
privatization) so that sector-specific constraints can be addressed. It also requires public sector
management reforms to address problems that cut across sectors, such as corruption, ineffective
contract enforcement and weak personnel management. Bank Group's assistance in these areas
will be provided in the context of the PEAP/PRSP pillars described in Section 2.
43. Looking to the future, the required assistance cannot be delivered by "business as usual"
modalities. Shifting the focus to the sector level and to public sector management issues means
that key decision-making can no longer be limited to the Ministry of Finance; sector ministries and
civil society need to be more effectively engaged in the development effort. Further, the shift in
focus requires a change in the Bank's lending modalities. Specifically, the shift would entail a
move away from supporting the traditional combination of structural adjustment operations and
discrete investment projects, to one of supporting a comprehensive reform program through a
series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) over the PRSP period, disbursed against
progress in policy and institutional reforms.12 Such a shift to programmatic development support
would be justified on four grounds: (i) the progress on macroeconomic reform has lessened the
need for traditional structural adjustment lending; (ii) the proposed PRSC instrument's focus on
sectoral policies would provide a more effective mechanism to address constraints at the sector
level than discrete investment projects; (iii) the PRSC instrumentwould provide a mechanism to
focus on cross-cutting reforms in public sector management, such as strengthening public
procurement, auditing, financial management and overall performance of the civil servicde and
(iv) the instrument would be valuable for donor support of a country-owned program. These
issues could not be as effectively addressed by a series of traditional, sector-specific projects. The
PRSC will be prepared within the PSAC framework as discussed in Programmatic and Emergency
Adjustment Lending: World Bank Guidelines (R98-249), October 2, 1998 and Operational Memorandum
Guidelines for Programmatic Adjustment Loans/Credits, Februay 11, 2000. See also Supporting Country
development: World Bank Role and Instruments in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (DC/2000-19),
September 8, 2000.
13 Details of the sequencing and complementarity of cross-cutting reforms will be provided in the context of
the PRSC that is currently being designed.
12

15

shift to PRSCs is also attractive in that it can provide direct support for the Bank work (as well as
other interested donors) on implementing the CDF and the PEAP/PRSP in Uganda. Indeed, the
PRSC instrument is opportune and is intended to support, over time, the implementation of a subset of reforms critical for poverty reduction, which are covered byUgandas well articulated
PEAP/PRSP. The shift to PRSC approach would be effectively underpinned by the broad and indepth ESW already carried out on Uganda (see para. 48). Overall, channeling IDA resources
through the budget, and thereby reducing the number of IDA interventions, would conserve the
Government's limited administrative resources. It is important to note, however, that in addition
to PRSCs, the Bank expects to continue with stand alone projects for capacity building and
infrastructure investments directly targeted to poverty alleviation and private sector development,
Where
and where institutional strengthening is required for improved service delivery.
appropriate, as in power, these projects will also explicitly support private participation, with the
Bank supporting regulatory reform and institutional development and IFC providing financing and
technical assistance for the private investors entering the sectors.
44. The shift to PRSCs is a feasible strategy, given Uganda's advanced budget process. The
Government's PEAP/PRSP and sector programs provide clear policy objectives and the MTEF
ensures consistency between public spending allocations and policy priorities, as discussed in
Section 2. Significant improvements in budget management have raised confidence that budget
resources will be used for intended purposes. Moreover, CAS-based program support has already
proven effective in Uganda: since 1997/98 the Bank has successfully been providing programs
support for the Government's UPE initiative through an Education Sector Adjustment Credit
(ESAC). In less than three years, the implementation of the UPE has almost tripled primary
school enrollments.
45. There are transitional challenges. Specifically, there are two areas where progress will be
essential to support movement to PRSCs. First, continued progress in the area of financial
management will be necessary. Second, sector strategies must be prepared for those sectors such
as water where it has not been done yet in order to deepen the policy dialogue with the Bank and
other development partners on sectoral issues. The assistance program proposed under this CAS
has been designed to address these challenges. Moreover, the transition to the PRSC instrument
will be carefully phased.
46. Assuming continued progress, two PRSCs are planned for the CAS period. PRSC I is
scheduled for FY01 and will focus on the delivery of basic services in education, health and water
and sanitation and cross-cutting reforms in public sector management, particularly procurement
and financial management. PRSC II will concentrate on rural development (including rural roads,
water, markets, environment, etc.) and continue cross-cutting public sector reforms. It is planned
for FY03, since the Government needs to operationalize the PMA - that is, develop structures
and capacities at local levels, and test/pilot some of key approaches - before PRSC II can be
effective.
D.
47.

SELECTIVITY iN BANK GRoup's PROGRAM

The Bank Group's assistance program is selective in two ways:
(a) selectivity is exercised in the activities being pursued:The Bank Group assistance
will concentrate on the key areas covered by the PEAP/PRSP but, within each area,
the Bank will provide support only to a sub-set of activities specified. In the spirit of
both selectivity and the Bank's desire to facilitate improved donor cooperation, a
consistent effort will be made to ensure that other donors take the lead in some
activities. For example, the USAID will take the lead in rural/micro-credit, while the
16

Bank will merely continue the dialogue with the Government on best practices in that
area. More broadly, Bank activities in the area of private sector development, in
addition to the support to privatization, will be limited to ESW only as other donors
(notably USAID, the EU, DflD and Austria) are providing significant capacity
building assistance in this area. Similarly, the Bank is not envisioning any financial
support for the development of a sector-wide approach in the legal sector as support
for this is already being provided byDflD, Norway and the Netherlands. In addition,
in all areas of Bank involvement, the Bank will be tailoring its support to take into
account other donor activities. For example, in the health sector, the Bank's
assistance will concentrate on the provision of primary health care and prevention of
HIV/AIDS, leaving hospitals or tertiary care to the Govemnuent and other donors. In
education sector, the Bank's efforts will focus on primary and secondary education,
while vocational and tertiary education will be taken care of by others. Finally, no
IDA investments will be made in Government parastatals after the Power IV project.
(b) selectivity is exercised in the instruments for providing assistance: As discussed
earlier, the Bank is moving toward mainstreaming its financing for various sectors via
budget support in lieu of specific investment requiring a multiplicity of
When appropriate, the Bank will explore the

possibility of using guarantees in place of lending so as to catalyze private
investments in infrastructure.
E.

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

48. Due Diligence Economic and Sector Work (ESW): The Bank Group has, in cooperation
with the Government of Uganda and other donors, established a broad-based information and
analytic base which provides the underpinnings for its policy dialogue and operations.
Participatory annual reviews of Public Expenditure have been carried out successfully since
1997/98, in the context of Uganda's MTEF exercise, and this work will continue to be undertaken
annually. As discussed earlier, poverty analysis in Uganda is breaking new grounds through
annual participatory poverty assessments, which are helping Uganda to develop and monitor the
progress in reducing poverty levels via a broad set of indicators and lessons of experience. In this
regard, Uganda's work on the PEAP, which served as its PRSP, is noteworthy. A CEM on the
"Challenge of Growth and Poverty Reduction" has subsequently been supplemented by a series of
in-depth strategic plans in the key sectors (see Annex 2), prepared by Government, with assistance
from donors including the Bank Group. Fiduciary/institutional assessments in, inter alia, the
financial and health sectors, have been carried out and service delivery survey/expenditure
tracking work is planned to gauge the quality and adequacy of public services in various areas,
such as health, education and agriculture. Significant work on the external debt and related
sustainability analysis has also been carried out in the context of the HIPC initiatives. Diagnostic
work in the areas of private sector development, governance and public sector management, has
been completed; further work, particularly in the area of accountability/anti-corruption, is planned.
The planned non-lending work in the Bank's Uganda program is designed to expand on and update
the rich analytical work already done, with a view to further improving the quality of the policy
dialogue and enhancing the impact of the Bank's lending interventions.
49. The Bank Group's proposed assistance program is fully consistent with and supports the
four pillars of the PEAP/PRSP. Under each pillar, the Bank is going to selectively support reforms
at the sector level and in governance. These activities will complement the existing portfolio (see
Annex 4 and Annex B8). Table 2 summarizes the proposed activities by fiscal year. The lending
and non-lending activities under each pillar will be as follows:

Directly increasingthe ability of the poor to raise their incomes

50.
Given the dominant role of agriculture in Uganda's economy and as the majority of the poor
live in rural areas, the Bank Group will assist a number of activities that aim to enhance
environmentally sustainable rural development and reduce regional disparities. Specifically, the
Bank will help the Government to identify interventions to be carried out under the PMA to
promote agricultural diversification and modernization and expansion of non-farm activities in
rural areas with two goals: (i) reducing poverty among subsistence food crop producers who are
predominantly women; and (ii) reducing economy's vulnerability to exogenous shocks caused by
commodity price changes, droughts and plant diseases. PRSC II will provide support to the
Government to carry out these interventions. Parallel with this work, analytic work on poverty
will continue. This work will examine progress on poverty reduction, identify regional and
sectoral disparities in poverty, and assess the benefit-incidence of public services to allow better
targeting of interventions. The specific lending and non-lending activities to be undertaken
include the following:
*

Lending/lnvestment:

-

Agricultural extension: The Bank Group will continue working with the Government
and donors to revitalize the agricultural extension system. This is expected to result in
a free standing agricultural extension project in this fiscal year.

18

Rural development: PRSC *I will focus on rural development (including rural roads,
rural water, rural finance and rural markets). The Bank Group will continue to work
with the Govermment and key donors to support strengthening of environmental
management capacity at the national and local levels, through an Environmental
Management Capacity Building II project. The Bank will also continue to support the
conservation and sustainable use of nationally and globally significant ecological and
biological resources. Also, PRSC II will build on PRSC I in addressing cross-cutting
public sector management issues.
Commercial agriculture and agribusiness: IFC will continue to focus on both large
scale and SME projects in non-traditional commercial agriculture and agribusiness.
Alleviation of regional disparities: The Second Northern Uganda Reconstruction
Project (NURP II) will target the relatively poor districts of Northern and Eastern
regions in the country that have not benefited proportionately from economic reform
and liberalization. Building on an earlier operation, the project will include a social fund
element to engage local communities in the development effort.
Non-lending:
Rural development studies: In preparation for PRSC II, the Bank Group will support
analytic work on rural development to identify interventions to be carried out under the
PMA to promote agricultural diversification, modernization and expansion of non-farm
activities in rural areas and reduction of poverty among subsistence food crop fanners.
Ruralfinance: While bilateral donors are taking the lead on funding rural finance, the
Bank will continue its dialogue with the Govemment on policy and on best practices in
rural micro-finance.
Piloton commodity risk management: As a part of an international pilot, a test of a new,
market-based approach to manage commodity price risk will be carried out in the coffee
sector in Uganda. The pilot introduces a price insurance program which will give
small-holder coffee farmers in Uganda access to risk management tools widely used in
intemational markets.
Workshop on Policy and InstitutionalReform for Sustainable Rural Development: The
World Bank Institute (WBI) will offer a course onPolicy and InstitutionalReform for
Sustainable Rural Development to address Uganda's training needs in this area. The
course focuses on the latest thinking and good practice in rural development and
sustainable natural resource management. WBI will also offer a distance learning
version of the course through the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN).
Poverty overview: Joint analytic work with the Government and other donors on
poverty will continue. This will include assessments of the incidence, and regional and
sectoral differences in poverty and the benefit-incidence of public services.
PRSP: In collaboration with the IMF and other donors, the Bank Group will assist
Government's efforts to implement its PEAP/PRSP. This will involve more robust
costing of the poverty programs and development of improved impact and outcome
indicators and monitoring systems. Further, effort will be made to improve local
capacity to undertake poverty analysis.
19

-

(ii)

Regional workshop on poverty reduction strategies: WBI will organize a distance
learning version of its regional workshop on Poverty Reduction Strategies. The purpose
of the workshop will be to encourage and empower all stakeholders to seek
participatory and sustainable solutions for the poverty and underdevelopment in the
national, regional, and global setting. It will allow Uganda to consolidate its early gains
from the PRSP process by exchanging lessons of experience with countries that are also
pursuing participatory development.

Directly increasing the quality of life of the poor

51.
As the participatory assessment work on poverty indicates, the poor in Uganda are
particularly concerned about their lack of access to basic services, such as health care, clean water
and the quality of pri-mary education. Given that these services have a major impact on the quality
of life of the poor, the Bank Group will assist activities that improve the delivery of these basic
public services. The specific lending and non-lending activities will be as follows:
*

Lending/Investment:

Delivery of education, health, water and sanitationservices: PRSC I will focus on the
delivery of education, health and water and sanitation services and on cross-cutting
reforms in public sector management. The specific actions to be taken to improve
service delivery will be specified during the program preparation.
HIV/AIDS: The HIV/AIDS ControlProject will support Uganda's effort in combating
the HIV/AIDS epidemic by attempting to alleviate its impact, increase access to
treatment and care by those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS and strengthen the
national capacity to respond to the epidemic. The project will provide HIV/AIDS
prevention, care and treatment services at all levels and in a number of sectors and
provide support for community-driven initiatives.
IFC investments in social sectors: IFC will build on its existing investments in
education and will support private initiatives in health and education which can have
broad impact. This work will be supported by IFC's newly established Social
Services Department.
*

Non-lending:

-

Education sector studies: An ESW task will be undertaken to review progress on UPE,
assess the impact of UPE on the demand for post-primary education, and examine
financially sustainable altematives to increase access to post-primary education.

-

Health sector studies: In the health sector, the impact of government health programs
will be reviewed, the role of the NGOs and the private sector will be assessed. There
will be an assessment of decentralization's impact on health services and an expenditure
tracking study.

-

Water sector studies: In the water sector, studies which have just been completed will
be followed up by further analytic work.

-

Workshops on health: WBI will work with the Institute of Public Health (IPH),
Makerere University, on adapting its course on Adapting to Change: Population,
Reproductive Health and Health Sector Reformto Uganda's specific needs. The long-

20

term aim of the course is to improve the population and reproductive health outcomes in
Uganda. In addition, WBI will organize a training-of-trainers workshop in Uganda on
Gender, Health and Poverty Reduction. The workshop will explore the relationships
between gender, health, education, and poverty.
-

(iii)

World Links for Development: WBI's World Links for Development (WorLD) program
provides Internet connectivity and computer integration training for teachers, teacher
trainers and students in Uganda. In 1999, 22 schools in Uganda were connected to the
program via Internet. Ten additional schools will be added in FYO1. It is estimated that
300 teachers and 1,200 students will participate in activities organized by the program.
Additionally, WBI will continue to support public and private partnerships designed to
help Ugandan schools experiment with various connectivity solutions to the Internet.

Creating an enabling environmentfor economic growth and structural transformation

52. To promote economic growth and development of the private sector in Uganda, the World
Bank Group will support activities that focus on removing the constraints to private sector
competitiveness, in particular infrastructure constraints, including inadequate and unreliable power
and roads. The Bank Group will also continue to support the privatization process and particularly
the utility reforms. These efforts will address the main constraints on new investment, in
particular foreign investment. IFC will directly support foreign investment in telecommunications,
power and other key sectors. In addition, the Bank's work to ensure macroeconomic stability will
continue and support will be given to further strengthen the budget process. Different lending and
non-lending activities will be as follows:
Lending/Investment:
-

Infrastructure. A number of projects will be undertaken to alleviate the key
infrastructure constraints to development. The Power IV project will aim to increase
the power generation capacity and support reforms to promote private participation in
the power sector in Uganda. Also, the project will support the establishment of a simple
regulatory framework for the petroleum sector that has been liberalized but is currently
operating unchecked. IFC is considering financing theBujagali Hydropower project
under IFC A loan and IFC B loan, while IDA will catalyze the participation of
commercial banks under an IDA partial risk guarantee. TheBujagali Hydropower
project is tied to milestones in the sector reforms, including progress towards the
privatization of the Uganda Electricity Board. Completion of this initiative will double
the country's power capacity and ensure that the transmission and distribution networks,
both in terms of physical and institutional capacity, can deliver the power. IDA and IFC
are also supporting the rural electrification effort to improve access to electricity and
thereby increase the quality of life in rural areas where the bulk of Ugandans live. IFC
will continue its support to the telecommunications sector and seek to support other
private infrastructure initiatives with financing and advisory assistance as appropriate.
Roads II and III will complete IDA's contribution towards the Government's 10-year
roads sector development and investment program. Rural roads are expected to be a
major component in PRSC II.

-

Privatization: IDA's recently approvedPrivatizationand Utility Sector Reform Project
will support the reform of key utilities and complete the divestiture of the remaining
public enterprises slated for privatization. lFC will seek to finance key investments
arising from the Govemnment's privatization program.

21

Financialsector development: During the CAS period, IFC will seek to take on a more
significant role with direct financial and technical support for financial institutions.
building on existing investments in development finance, leasing, insurance and on
advisory work with the Govermment on the stock exchange. This will complement the
already approved FinancialMarkets Assistance Project. Under this project, the Bank is
promoting the financial sector reform agenda by supporting the restructuring and reprivatization of UCB, further strengthening regulation and supervision both in banking
and the other sub-sectors and by initiating reform of the National Social Security Fund.
SME support: IFC will build on its strong portfolio of direct SME investments to
provide additional financial support to key private initiatives.
Regional integration: The Bank is considering support for a Regional Trade
FacilitationProject which is scheduled for Board consideration in FY01. In addition, it
is planned to undertake the second phase of the Lake Victoria project to sustain the
effort to protect Lake Victoria's ecosystem.
Non-lending:
Private sector advisory services: The new joint Bank/IFC Private Sector Advisory
Services Department will continue its support for improving the private sector enabling
environment in Uganda. FIAS will work with the Government and the Investment
Authority in particular, on reducing investment related bureaucracy and improving
investment regulations and promotion. Specifically, an assessment of the progress on
reducing investment red tape will be carried out and assistance on implementation of
further reforms will be given. Corporate Finance Services division will seek to support
other government privatization initiatives with advisory services, as with
telecommunications.
Private sector studies: Successful implementation of the Government's Medium Term
Competitive Strategy for the Private Sector (2000-2005) will require support from the
donor community, including the World Bank Group. The formulation of the strategy is
a significant step forward, the challenge now is to translate its broad agenda into
actions. Additional analytical work will be carried out to help the Government to
formulate a specific set of policy measures and to help the Government to finalize and
implement the key measures according to an agreed timetable.
SME capacity building and technicalsupport: In addition, the Bank Group will provide
capacity building and technical support to SMEs through the Africa Project
Development Facility and the African Management Services Company. Other services
will be developed under the management of the new joint IFC/Bank SME Department
which manages these facilities. This will include advocacy work with the Government
to support reforms critical to SMEs.
Financialsector: Together with the IMF, the Bank is planning to carry out a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission to Uganda in FY01. The FASP analyzes
the sensitivity of financial institutions to macroeconomic shocks; measures the depth,
development and diversity of the parts of the financial system; evaluates the adequacy
of legal and institutional infrastructure; assesses compliance with selected intemational
standards; and proposes priorities for work to strengthen the financial sector. The
ongoing Financial Markets Assistance Project will play an important role in supporting

22

follow-up actions agreed with the Ugandan authorities that arise out of the FSAP
findings and recommendations.

(iv)

-

Strengthening of public expenditure management: To strengthen further the budget
processes, annual Public Expenditure Reviews (PER) will be carried out. These will be
complemented as needed by expenditure tracking studies that focus on the utilization
and cost efficiency of government expenditures in selected areas.

-

Debt sustainability: Analytic work will be carried out on long term debt sustainability
under current IDA and donor funding scenarios.

-

MIGA guarantees: To date MIGA has issued a total of 16 guarantees for 10 projects in
the agribusiness, manufacturing, mining and telecommunications sectors, and has held a
number of regional events relating to investment promotion, trade and financing
strategies. MIGA stands ready to expand its portfolio in the country over the CAS
period, as Uganda offers good opportunities for foreign investment in a number of
sectors.

-

Information and communication strategy andpolicy: It is recognized that the use of
information and communication technologies (ICTs) and modern information
management systems can increase the credibility and effectiveness of efforts to improve
access to information, transparency in public sector decision-making and build private
and public sector capabilities. To promote the use ofICTs in Uganda, the Bank will
support the Government's efforts to (i) develop a National Information and
Communication Strategy to establish a national ICT policy framework to promote the
use of information and communication technologies for development; (ii) implement an
integrated Public Sector Management Information System to promote fiscal oversight,
transparency and accountability; and (iii) provide support for the establishment of the
Uganda Country Gateway web-site.

-

Regional integration: Uganda is a member of the East African Community (EAC)
which aims to create a common market for the three member countries (Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania). The Bank Group will arrange workshops and provide technical
assistance to address key economic and social development issues of interest to the
three member countries. In addition, the Bank Group will continue to provide advisory
support to the ongoing Nile Basin Initiative, in which nine riparian countries of the Nile
River basin are cooperatively seeking to harness the potential of the Nile in
environmentally sustainable ways.

Ensuring good governance and security

53. Corruption remains a serious issue in Uganda and considerable effort has been made to
ensure that Bank investments meet the highest test of propriety. Nevertheless, given the
prevalence of corruption, fiduciary considerations and vigilance are critical. The importance of
addressing the issue is heightened by the focus of the proposed PRSC instrument.
Since poor governance compromises the effect of the Government's, Bank Group's and
54.
other donors' interventions, support will be given to selected public sector management reforms
and analytic work will be conducted in this area. Improving governance and combating corruption
that is systemic requires strengthening of institutions in particular, institutions promoting
accountability and transparency in Government. In Uganda the Bank's work will focus on (but not
limited to) the strengthening of the offices of the Inspector General of Government, the Minister of
23

the Ethics and the Accountant General. Other donors are working with the Judiciary and the
Accountant General. In addition, making progress requires a strong political commitment to
reform: the anti-corruption efforts need to be strongly grounded in the political system, and the
system needs to ensure that corruption will not be tolerated. The Bank Group's approach is to
provide a coherent set of interventions designed to address both of these concerns and to work
closely with the Government, donor community and civil society in ensuring their implementation.
Specific tasks to be undertaken are as follows:
•

Lending/Investment:
-

Public sector reforms to promote accountability and reduce corruption: PRSC I and II
will provide a framework for addressing various cross-cutting public sector
management reforms, in particular at the central level, to increase accountability, reduce
corruption and thereby improve public service delivery. These will include reforms in
public procurement, public sector pay, monitoring and evaluation, personnel
management and accountability. These institutional reforms will complement the ongoing work on financial accountability (on accounting, auditing, and inspection
functions) and public sector management delivered through the Second Economic and
FinancialManagement Project and Local Government Development Project.

-

Public sector capacity building: In order to improve the performance of public service
delivery, the Bank will support a Capacity Building/Civil Service Reform project that
assists institutional development in Uganda. The project will aim to strengthen the
analytic, managerial and implementation capacity at different levels of government.

•

Non-lending:
-

Decentralization: Analytic work will focus on assessing the performance and impact of
decentralization on public service delivery. Specifically, the work will attempt to
identify the constraints to effective decentralized public service delivery and provide
guidance for further reform. A conference is proposed to be held in Kampala in 2002 to
assess the first five years of decentralization in Uganda. All levels of Government,
Parliament, civil society and donors will be involved in this event. Also, WBI will
provide a course on Decentralization:Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Local
FinancialManagement that will continue to be open to Ugandan participants. A special
effort will also be made to work with local partner institutions to adapt the course to
Uganda's specific needs and incorporate it into their curriculum. Finally, an effort is
being made with the Rockefeller Foundation to develop a set of courses devoted to
capacity building at the district level.

-

Accountability and corruption: Improving accountability and tackling corruption will
be given high priority in the work program. While the Government has taken many
steps in establishing public institutions and has successfully pursued a number of high
level investigations into corruption, the general view is that corruption remains too high
and that the Government needs to take bolder measures to improve transparency and
accountability to address the problem. Analytic work on corruption in Uganda has
moved beyond anecdotal evidence to a more robust assessment of the cost of
corruption. An effort to build on and continue this work will be sustained. For
example, expenditure tracking studies will be conducted to assess possible leakage of
funds. To enhance Government's awareness of corruption and its commitment to
address the problem, a high-level conference on corruption is planned to be held in
Kampala in early 2001. This event will bring together recent analytic work, an
24

assessment of the Government's efforts to curb corruption and, hopefully, conclude
with agreement and commitment to the way forward. The World Bank Group will also
continue to support Government's efforts to reduce corruption through its anticorruption Plan of Action.
F.

MANAGING THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO

55. With 24 ongoing projects in various sectors, and commitments totaling about US$1.1
billion, the IDA's Uganda portfolio is one of largest in the region. Sustaining and introducing
further improvements in the implementation of this portfolio is a key component of the CAS.
Considerable efforts on improving implementation over the past three years have had a dramatic
and positive impact on disbursements. The disbursement ratio in the past two years has been
above 25 percent - a superior performance on both regional and Bank-wide basis. Furthermore,
the implementation quality of the program, as measured by pro-activity and realism ratings, has
improved as well. Presently less than ten percent of the Uganda portfolio is rated as unsatisfactory
on the basis of implementation performance and development impact. Overall, the Uganda
program is deemed to be substantively achieving its development objectives (DO) and contributing
toward the achievement of Government's key priorities. The DO ofall active projects is currently
rated satisfactory or highly satisfactory. However, the relative performance (and related
development impact) of certain sectors, and of selected projects within each sector (for example,
the education sector and the Education Sector Adjustment Credit), is stronger than that of other
areas within the portfolio, such as agriculture and roads. The Bank will continue to conduct
annual portfolio reviews in order to identify and address portfolio-wide bottlenecks. A more
extensive discussion of the portfolio is provided in Annex 4.
56. IFC's portfolio (as of July 2000) remains modest at US$4 lmillion in a total of 25 projects.
Portfolio performance has been reasonably good and no systemic problems have emerged at the
country level in IFC's investments. The US$75 million under consideration for theBujagali
Hydropower project would increase this total exposure substantially.
G.

DONOR COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION

57. The Bank's work in Uganda has become increasingly participatory in the past few years.
Civil society has been fully involved in the PER discussions, and the Consultative Group (CG)
meetings have been moved to Kampala and opened to the public and press (see Box 5).
Participation will continue to be central in the implementation of this CAS in Uganda.

58. Facilitating partnerships and donor coordination will be an increasingly important
component of the Bank's work in Uganda, given that the Bank is the country's largest donor. A
25

wide range of donors, both multilateral and bilateral, are active in the country. For many years,
these donors pursued their programs in relative isolation from one another. The pressures and
distortions to government capacity that resulted from this past behavior is, however, no longer
manageable or sustainable. There has been significant progress in donor coordination over the
past years, the PEAP/PRSP and the CDF processes have intensified this effort. All key bilateral
donors, the United Nations and multilateral agencies are supporting Uganda's PEAP/PRSP/CDF
with interventions across most sectors (see Table 3, the partnership matrix), with some overlap
therefore inevitable across sectors. While duplication and overlap remains, it is clearly at a lower
level than in the past.

Significant Focus

High Focus

59. Over the CAS period, two donor coordination areas will receive attention. First, the
strengthening of donor coordination at the sector level will be emphasized as a key component of
the PRSCs. Considerable donor interest has emerged in respect to this instrument and substantial
co-financing is likely. Second, while there is already close collaboration on Uganda within the
World Bank Group (IDA, IFC, MIGA, FIAS and WBI), and between the Bank and the IMF, these
relations are being reinforced as new efforts, including the PRSP and Enhanced HIPC, will require
even closer collaboration within the World Bank Group, and between the Bank Group and the
IMF.

H.

BANK GROUP DECENTRALIZATION

60. The Bank's Uganda program is now led by the Country Director (CD) stationed in Dar es
Salaam. A 30 person mission in Kampala is visited at least monthly by the CD. The mission
plays a leading role in the macroeconomic dialogue and is staffed to support key sectors. Looking
to the future, IDA anticipates moving some social sector capacity from the headquarters to the
field and expects to strengthen the macroeconomic team in Kampala. IFC also has a country
office in Kampala, located in the joint Bank office. IFC's local presence has proven very useful to
the Bank Group's work on private sector development.
26

I.

RESOURCE REQUIREMENT

61. It is estimated that there will be a modest increase in resource requirements to deliver the
proposed program. As indicated above, the shift from the traditional project approach to the PRSC
instrument is expected over time to free up some resources which will be applied to more analytic
work and improving supervision. Poverty and sector analysis in particular will require incremental
resources.
J.

CAS CONSULTATIONS

62. This CAS reflects the consultations that the Bank staff held with the Government and the
civil society at the beginning of the CAS preparatory process. Subsequently, the Bank circulated
and discussed a draft CAS document with the Government, donors, parliamentarians, NGOs,
private sector as well as other civil society representatives in April/May 2000. Box 6 summarizes
the comments received on the draft CAS.

4. MACROECONOMIC PROSPECTS FOR CONTINUED POVERTY REDUCTION
A.

MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS

63. Only two economic scenarios are considered inthe Bank Group's strategy for the next three
years: the high case and low case. The high case scenario is treated as the most likely case, as in
the previous CAS. Given Uganda's track record in maintaining macroeconomic stability and its
27

demonstrated ability to live up to its commitments, the Bank and the Govemment consider the
assumptions set out below to be realistic with Uganda continuing in a high case scenario. Also, for
the Govemment to achieve its poverty reduction objective, it has to continue operating in the high
case.
(i)

The High Case:

64. The high case framework is consistent with the Govemment's program supported by the
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program and assumes that the reform
program will be sustained, vital extemal support will continue, normal weather pattems will
prevail and the security situation remains under control. It also assumes that the identified
constraints to private sector growth will be effectively addressed. Under this scenario it is
expected that there will be: (i) sustained growth in the agriculture sector as a result of the PMA
implementation effort; (ii) improvement in efficiency of capital and capacity utilization resulting
from ongoing and planned structural reforms (including privatization) and investments addressing
infrastructure constraints, particularly in the power and transport sectors and (iii) aggregate fiscal
discipline with efficient allocation and use of public resources. The proposed CAS activities are
precisely aimed at alleviating existing constraints and facilitating the realization of these
assumptions.
65.
Consequently, private investment is assumed to increase from about 10 percent of GDP to
nearly 12 percent of GDP by 2002/03. The agricultural sector is assumed to grow by between 4
and 4.5 percent per annum. On this basis, GDP is projected to grow up to seven percent per annum
with annual inflation rates of about five percent. International reserves will be maintained at a
level equivalent to about five months of imports of goods and services (see Table 4). This
performance assumes that the industrial sector will grow at about 10 to 12 percent a year and the
service sector will increase by between 6 and 7 percent per annum.
66. The analysis carried out for the PRSP indicates that although seven percent real GDP
growth per annum is difficult, it is attainable, provided action is taken to improve contract
enforcement and reduce risks (in terms of reducing the risk of expropriation and contract
repudiation by Government and improving bureaucratic quality and the rule of law). If the real
GDP grows at seven percent per annum, Government's objective to reduce poverty (headcount
index) to ten percent by 2017 will be achieved, if the growth is broadly distributed (that is, no
sector lags behind). Since agricultural incomes are projected to grow at only between 4 and 4.5
percent per annum in the next three years, to ensure that poor rural households do not lag behind,
Government's and Bank's strategies need to target these households through agricultural
modernization and by switching to non-farm private sector activities.
67. FinancialRequirement: To implement the PEAP/PRSP program through the MTEF under
the high case scenario, Uganda's total external financing requirements are estimated at US$7.3
billion for the three-year period. Of this amount, about US$5 billion are expected to be generated
from Uganda's own resources, leaving a gap of about US$2.3 billion to be financed from external
sources including debt relief. According to the outcome of the CG meeting held in Kampala in
March 2000, donors pledged adequate resources to cover Uganda's external financing gap over the
next three years (2000/01 to 2002/03) which coincide with the CAS period. The prospects for
disbursements of that high level of donor financing, particularly for social sector and other priority
areas, appear favorable. Consequently, the targeted level of donor financing is a reasonable
expectation, provided Uganda sustains its high level of performance and lives up to its
commitments to the CG.

68. IDA commitments during the three-year CAS period would total approximately US$1.1
billion (consistent with IDA allocation for Uganda), almost half of the external financing
requirements. About 40 percent of the IDA funding would be provided in the form of budget
support. IFC support to Uganda, driven by the US$75 million anticipated for the Bujagali
Hydropower project. would substantially increase over the CAS period reflecting increased
investment levels as well as other opportunities in infrastructure requiring intemational project
finance.
29

(ii)

The Low Case:

69. Falling to the low case would result from a deterioration in the internal security situation
leading to declining growth and/or Uganda being drawn deeper into regional conflicts resulting in
increased military spending. The low case could also occur, if the Presidential and general
elections scheduled for 2001 result in a government less committed to reform and subsequently,
pursues inappropriate economic policies. The low case scenario presented in Table 4 is built
around the assumption that the macroeconomic program goes off track in 2000/01. This scenario is
characterized by GDP growth rates of between 3-4 percent, with agricultural and industrial output
decreasing respectively to about 2.5 to 3 percent and 5 to 7.8 percent per annum and an annual
inflation of between 6-15 percent. Foreign reserves would be drawn down to 2.5 to 4.0 months of
imports and the fiscal deficit would be covered by a greater share of domestic bank financing and
non-concessional external borrowing.
70. FinancingImplications under the Low Case: Under this scenario, the IDA lending program
would be reduced to total commitments of US$300 million over the next three years, and would
result in the formulation of a new CAS with Bank support focusing primarily on key infrastructure
investments. At present the Bank sees the probability for this case as low. For IFC, such a case
would also mean lower investment levels. Specifically, a low case for IFC implies a series of
events in which the government's support for power sector can not sustain the Bujagali
Hydropower project or in which there are intrinsic issues arising during appraisal which preclude
IFC investment.
B.

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

71. Several external and exogenous factors will influence Uganda's economic prospects. First,
as discussed in Section 1, because the economy is dependent on agriculture, the country is
vulnerable to droughts and plant diseases that could decrease agricultural outputs and rural
incomes. Second, the economy is subject to terms of trade shocks. In particular, changes in
international coffee prices are a cause of concern because over half of Uganda's export revenues
come from coffee. Declining coffee prices could result in sharp reduction in export revenues and
rural incomes. Also, recent increases in international oil prices are negatively affecting the
economy by increasing the cost of imports. Third, internal and external security situation
discussed in Section 1 poses a serious risk to the economy and could result in diversion of
resources to defense expenditures and undermine the investor confidence in the economy. The
current level of international reserves together with the HIPC debt relief increase, however, the
country's ability to absorb temporary external shocks. Also, the proposed assistance program is
addressing the issue of further diversification of agricultural production to mitigate the
vulnerability to the shocks.
C.

TRIGGERS

72. The regular consultations which take place during the MTEF process andsector reviews
with key stakeholders will provide the framework within which judgments will be formed on
whether the Bank's program should shift to the low case scenario. Three sets of triggers are
proposed for this move (see Box 7). First, deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as
evidenced by weakened fiscal discipline (including defense expenditures rising above recent
levels) constitutes the first trigger. The second set of triggers relates to the implementation of
poverty programs. The triggers include a declining share of budgetary allocations to and spending
in the key anti-poverty areas and unsatisfactory implementation of poverty reducing programs
(including the PMA). The third set of triggers relates to governance: specifically, to unsatisfactory
30

implementation of the Anti-Corruption Plan and civil service reforms. The macro trigger and/or
the implementation of the PEAP/PRSP are enough to shift the Bank's program to the low case
scenario. Whether the other triggers will lead to a move to the low case cannot be determined
apriori; the decision will depend on the country's overall performance in all three areas (macro,
poverty, governance). These triggers and means of verification are laid out in more detail in Box 7.

BENCHMARK INDICATORS

73. Benchmarks for Government Performance: Annex B9 lists performance indicators that the
Government intends to use to assess its progress in implementing the PEAP/PRSP program
through the MTEF. It is recognized, however, that many of these benchmarks change slowly over
time, while others will require more robust sectoral information systems, which are currently being
developed. Over the CAS period, some of these measurable benchmarks include:

4

*

Poverty eradication: Maintain the PAF share of total expenditures at least at 25 percent
of the budget; increase per capita consumption of the poorest quintile; reduce proportion
of Ugandans falling below the poverty line; reduce regional disparities in poverty.

*

Infrastructure: Increase kilometers of main roads improved and maintained (163 km of
new bitumen roads and 70 km of gravel roads upgraded to tarmac in 2000/01); increase
kilometers of rural roads maintained and rehabilitated (15,000 km and 1,800 km
respectively planned for 2000/01); increase rural access to electricity.

Defense expenditures in the 2000/01 budget are set at two percent of GDP (at factor cost).
31

*

Health: Increase immunization rates (increasing DPT3 coverage rates from 35 percent
to 80 percent by 2002/03); increase percentage of health centers with trained staff from
present 55 percent to 65 percent by 2002/03.

*

Education: Improve quality of education by reducing the pupil/teacher ratio (falling
from 58:1 to 47:1 by 2002/03), pupil/classroom ratio (declining from the current 118:1
to 87:1 by 2002/03) and pupil/book ratio (falling from 6:1 to 3:1 by 2002/03).

*

Water supply and sanitation: Increase rural coverage from 40 percent to nearly 82
percent by 2002/03 by adding 1,500 boreholes, 700 protected springs and 1,700
protected wells to the stock of rural water sources.

74. Benchmarks for Bank Group's Performance: The Bank Group's strategy is designed to
support the Government's anti-poverty program and help the Government achieve the above
indicators. Successful implementation of the CAS can be measured by: (i) maintenance of
macroeconomic stability based on inflation, growth and fiscal performance targets, monitored
jointly by the Bank and IMF during periodic review missions and annual public expenditure
reviews and (ii) achievement of the Bank Group performance benchmarks will focus in the areas
of quality of life (PRSC I) and rural incomes (PRSC II). The quality of Bank portfolio
performance can be measured by: (i) the number of at risk projects is not to exceed 15 percent of
total projects and (ii) an overall disbursement ratio in excess of 20 percent is to be maintained.
IFC's performance can be assessed by the level and development impact of IFC investments,
number and effectiveness of advisory and other technical assistance projects and the financial
performance of IFC'c country portfolio.
E.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

75. To monitor the progress in achieving the performance benchmarks, the Government is
developing a system that tracks indicators at three levels: inputs, outputs, and outcomes. Several
instruments will be used to collect the information: national accounts, balance of payments, annual
household surveys, national service delivery surveys, regular sector reviews, participatory poverty
assessments, expenditure tracking studies and other specific studies that will be commissioned for
the purpose. The CAS matrix in Annex B9 lists which instruments will be used to measure the
progress in each area. Further work in developing and coordinating the indicators and instituting
the monitoring and evaluation system is, however, required. The PRSC will support work on
monitoring and evaluation during the CAS period.
F.

CONSTRAINTS AND RISKS

76. Constraints and Risks for the Country: Several risks could threaten Uganda's ability to
implement its development agenda:
.

As already discussed above, there are pervasive institutional and human capacity
weaknesses, which need to be addressed, at the center but especially at the district level.
There is a risk that these constraints could undermine the implementation of the
proposed PRSC and thus impede the much-needed improvement in public service
delivery. However, in addition to ongoing projects, the CAS includes both lending and
non-lending instruments to address identified gaps and help mitigate against the risk.

*

The security situation both in Northem and in Westem Uganda could deteriorate and
result in diversion of substantial resources to defense expenditure. It could also
undermine confidence and reduce foreign as well as domestic investment, and prevent
32

the local population undertaking economic activities. The Govermnent is acutely aware
of the risk and is making a determined effort to minimize it, including an offer of
amnesty to the country's dissidents and reconciliation with the neighboring countries
supporting rebel activities.
*

Corruption remains a serious development issue which, hitherto, has shown only limited
signs of responding to the Government's anti-corruption measures. It could inhibit
private sector confidence and investment and hamper improvements in public service
delivery. However, the President is committed to aggressively addressing the problem.
The challenge facing the Government now is the implementation of its anti-corruption
Plan of Action.

*

The devastating effects of HIV/AIDS can potentially disrupt the economy in two ways.
First, the disease robs Uganda of many of her highly trained, technical personnel in a
capacity-constrained environment. Second, the number of AIDS orphans is rising,
putting pressure on family and social structures. However, Uganda is committed to
intensifying its information program, reducing mother-to-child transmission and
promoting community involvement in the care of AIDS patients.

*

Exogenous risks such as adverse weather patterns and/or terms of trade shocks, would
decrease agricultural output and exports and could result in sharp declines in rural
incomes where most of Uganda's poor reside.

*

Political transition in Uganda presents a clear challenge to Government. Despite the
results of the Referendum on multiparty democracy held in June 2000, there will be
continued pressure on Government for further political reforms as Uganda approaches
presidential and local elections in 2001. The Govemment is aware of the potential
risks. President Museveni has indicated his openness to dialog on this issue.

77. Risks for the Bank Group: The greatest risk faced by the Bank Group in achieving its CAS
objectives is overestimating the Government's ability to implement the PEAP/PRSP. The Bank's
three-year program laid out in Section 3 is designed to address each of the potential risks by:
*

Increasing the Government's planning, monitoring and accountability capacity,
particularly at the district level;

*

Building an effective Government's incentive system needed to improve service
delivery.

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
78. The main goal of the Government's development plan and the Bank Group's Country
Assistance Strategy is to support Uganda's economic transformation and reduce poverty. The
economic and sector work and lending operations proposed in this CAS are specifically designed
to help Uganda reach this goal.

Results of the Client Survey and OED Review
Client Survey Results
1.
The results of the latest Uganda client survey, that was undertaken in 1999, are mixed.
There are a number of areas including staff's technical competence, clarity of communication,
knowledge about international best practices and reliability, which Ugandan clients consider
important and where the World Bank is perceived to be effective. In addition, the World Bank
received high effectiveness rating in helping to: (i) strengthen and maintain sound
macroeconomic and trade policies; (ii) establish the physical infrastructure essential for
development; and (iii) bring about economic growth. However, there are other areas in which the
Bank's efforts were viewed as being less effective. These include: poverty reduction assistance;
establishing conditions for long term sustainability; helping to ensure value for money in Bank
funded projects; facilitating beneficiary participation; showing flexibility with regard to
procurement rules and procedures; building capacity at the community level; promoting private
involvement in delivery of public service; and helping improve govemance.
OED Review and Findings
2.
The results of OED's recent Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) for Uganda are also
mixed. Noting the "remarkable" economic recovery since 1986 and the sustained growth since
1992, OED gave high praise on macroeconomic performance. It complemented the significant
impact of growth on poverty levels, noted the progress on gender issues and in social sectors
programs and acknowledged the emphasis of the IDA program on participation. OED's
judgement on Bank's project performance was less favorable. OED's view of the structural
adjustment program was very positive, but was not so positive on the sectoral portfolios- in
particular with the programs in infrastructure and private sector. On capacity building, OED
recognized some progress, but criticized the IDA interventions as ineffectual. OED also felt more
effort was required on decentralization and corruption. Finally, OED expressed concern on the
sustainability of Uganda's growth efforts, noting that the potential gains from increased capacity
utilization have been fully exploited. Key lessons of the evaluation are presented below.

Uganda: Portfolio Overview
Current Status of the Uganda Portfolio
1.
As of July 31, 2000 a total of 83 credits and 9 loans, amounting to some US$2,948 million
(US$2,905 million from IDA and US$43 million from IBRD) had been approved for Uganda.
Total disbursements amounted to nearly US$2,408 million. The active Uganda portfolio
comprises 24 projects (as well as a US$33 million supplemental credit to the Power III Project)
with commitments totaling US$1.1 billion. Two new interventions (Local Government
Development Program and Second Economic and Financial Management Project) totaling some
$115 million were approved in FY00, while two projects closed during the fiscal year. A
Privatization and Utility Reform Project in the amount of US$48.5 million has also been
approved in August 2000. The undisbursed balance (not including recent approvals) is about
US$408 million or about 36 percent of the total commitments, reflecting broad-based
improvements in implementation progress over the last three years or so. While this percentage
was well below that of recent years and supported the proposed move to increase new
commitments over the planning period, the somewhat static disbursement rate (26.2 percent) in
fiscal year 2000 has been a result of increased focus on strengthening the procurement
performance under the portfolio in light of the findings of an in depth Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) conducted recently.
2.
Sustained improvement in portfolio implementation was a key focus of the last CAS (April
1997). Involving a comprehensive evaluation of the actual status of the portfolio, our joint
objectives with Govemment were to make: (i) the portfolio consistent with theGOU's priorities
outlined in its Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP); and ii) identify and address capacity
constraints and portfolio - wide bottlenecks to timely project implementation. The latter would
help raise the percentage of successful projects through more effective supervisions and
retrofitting of the existing portfolio with performance indicators.
Structure of the Portfolio
3.
Uganda's active investment portfolio falls in the following broad sectors: agriculture,
environment (including GEF supported operations), human capital development, private/public
sector management, and infrastructure. In addition, IDA has two adjustment credits in Uganda one for the overall economic policy reform, and the other for reforms in the education sector. If
one compares the evolution of the portfolio from the last CAS, it has evolved in directions
consistent with the objectives reflected in the Uganda PEAP. There has been a significant rise in
lending in the social sectors for human capacity development: an adjustment operation in the
education sector was approved in FY98, in the amount of US$80 million (also the proceeds
(US$75m) of the initial HPC relief were dedicated to the education sector) and IDA approved an
investment operation in Nutrition and Early Childhood Development. In addition three earlier
projects in health and education remain under implementation.
4.
The lending in the agricultural sector has been consolidated, with the focus being on the
provision of research and extension services. Lending in the area of environment has increased:
the total lending in environment related projects now stands at nearly US$50 million. The Bank
also continues to support Uganda's efforts in policy and institutional reform to encourage private
investment and ensure a competitive business environment. In tandem, improvements in public

38

Annex 4
sector performance for enhanced public service delivery is being stressed. The portfolio in
infrastructure investment is being consolidated with an emphasis on roads and power.
Disbursements Under the Portfolio
5.
Total FY99 disbursements were close to US$156 million (a disbursement rate of 26.2
percent). Total disbursements for FY00 amounted to US$152 million, of which investment
disbursements are to the order of US$113.4 million. The (annualized) disbursement ratio
currently stands at about 21 percent, which continues to be well above the 13 percent level
attained in both FY94 and FY95 and compares favorably to both Africa Region and Bank-wide
averages. As noted earlier, this relative slow-down in the disbursements ratio is indicative of
conscious efforts to further strengthen procurement performance under the ongoing projects.
Disbursement has also been effected under the Third Structural Adjustment Credit during April
2000. Some US$38.5 million equivalent was disbursed in April and processing of the final
tranche of US$38.6 million was underway at the time of writing. The third and finaltranche of
some US$34 million equivalent under the Education Sector Adjustment Credit was disbursed this
fiscal year.
Current Portfolio Improvement Efforts
6.
Increasing focus on the implementation performance of Bank projects in Uganda has been
leading to a steady improvement over the past few years; portfolio quality as measured by
"problem projects" has reflected this trend. In FY96 and FY97 the share of problem projects in
the portfolio increased steadily, largely due to an effort to improve the accuracy and realism in
project ratings. This downgrading trend led to an increase in the number of problem projects in
the portfolio from no problem projects at the end of FY96 to seven projects out of 20 rated as
being unsatisfactory at the beginning of FY97. However, the conscious portfolio strengthening
efforts over the past three years have reduced the number of problem projects in the portfolio.
Concerted project level actions and a 1998 CPPR focusedinter alia on resolving generic issues
like poor procurement and disbursement record, inadequate project management or noncompliance with covenants, etc., have lead to a decline in the share of problem projects
(commitments) from over 34 percent in FY97 to under four percent in FY00. As of end-July
2000, the number of problem projects in the portfolio has fallen significantly with only two
projects - the Financial Markets Assistance and the El Nino Emergency Projects being rated
unsatisfactory in light of inadequate implementation progress. The two are being carefully
monitored. Overall, Uganda's portfolio performance indicators compare quite favorably with
Bank-wide as well as Africa Region averages:
*

Ninety-two percent of the portfolio (in terms of numbers) is now rated satisfactoryup from some 65 percent in FY97.

*

OED's evaluation of completed projects with ratings of "unsatisfactory outcome"
has improved somewhat from over 40 percent in 1995 to 33 percent currently.
Likewise, the net-disconnect between the PSR and OED ratings has improved from
40 to 33 percent respectively in the period under review.

•

The pro-activity index has improved from a level of 50 percent in 1997 to 100
percent currently compared to the Africa Region ratio of 83 percent.

39

Annex 4
*

The realism index stands at 67 percent compared to 86 percent for the Region. In
this respect it is noteworthy that all Uganda projects are impacted by the blanket
imposition of a "risky country" status or flag, which implies that active operations
with even two project-specific issues/flags, default to a "potential problem" status as
a result of the application of the risky country flag.

IDA's Future Lending Program and Portfolio Improvement Strategy
7.
The principles guiding the development of a sound lending pipeline for Uganda continue to
include: (a) operations designed to be fully consistent with the objectives of the Uganda PEAP reinforcing the Govemnment's goal of poverty reduction through measures aimed at improved
economic growth performance and improved access to socio-economic services; (b) superior
quality of projects at entry, ensured through: greater ownership by the borrower and key
stakeholders as well as rigorous preparatory work at the design stage and capacity building over
the life of the operation; and (c) diligent supervision on the Bank's part and particularly intensive
supervision in the case of emerging implementation issues. Project design is being sharpened
through upstream peer reviews and a focus on the development of clearly defined and
monitorable project impact (including outputs and outcomes) indicators. In addition to a
transparent and ongoing dialogue with Government and Bank efforts under ongoing operations, a
number of cross-cutting IDA and Government initiatives (including internal semi-annual portfolio
reviews, the ARPP exercise, the CPPR, the CPAR, CFAA and the PERIMTEF) will contribute to
enhanced implementation and further the efforts at addressing generic portfolio-wide issues. In
this regard:
*

The Bank's Quality Assurance Group's (QAG) "Rapid Quality at Entry" assessment
carried out for two recent entrants into the Uganda portfolio resulted in overall
satisfactory ratings.

*

The QAG review of the quality of economic analysis in the context of relatively
recent projects also earned satisfactory grades.

8.
Other efforts at reshaping the portfolio to enhance the quality, sustainability and impact of
Bank operations are underway:
*
In developing its PEAP, Government is attempting to provide a sharper framework
within which the development partners are expected to provide support for growth and
poverty eradication. These efforts are consistent with the Comprehensive Development
Framework (CDF) endorsed by the Government to further Uganda's adoption of the
principles of ownership and partnership. With increased ownership, it is expected that the
portfolio's emphasis will shift to areas with greater urgency of reform.
*
The Country Team is applying lessons of experience and utilizing new instruments.
An Adjustable Programmatic Lending (APL) approach has been adopted for the roads
sector in line with GOU policies. Two PRSCs are envisaged in areas of social service
delivery as well as rural development and environment in FY01 and FY03, respectively.
These and the other parts of the lending program draw heavily from the findings of the
substantive analytic work being carried out to review the record in economic growth and
sectoral development in Uganda as well as the grassroots impact of the policies and
programs; the analytic work is largely based on the household surveys and the surveys of
the private firms and investors. All these actions should further improve quality at entry
and are expected to contribute to improved portfolio implementation.

Annex 4

The Country Performance Portfolio Review is scheduled for May 2001.

Remaining Challenges
While the perfonnance of the Uganda Portfolio is now quite robust, there area few
9.
remaining areas which merit closer follow-up:
*

Pace of implementation: The average age of the portfolio at about four years
continues to be high as compared with the Bank-wide average age of 3.6 years (but
in line with the Africa Region average). The number of projects with extended
closing date increased from 2 to 6 between FY97 and FY00. The number of
projects under implementation for five years or more now stands at nine, or some 38
percent of the portfolio.

*

Financial management continues to be an issue. The number of projects with
outstanding or overdue audit reports nearly doubled from eight at the end of FY97 to
14 active projects in March 2000, but is now down to eight projects again.
Measures to improve this situation are being launched by the financial specialist in
the Country Office with back-stopping by the Operations Support staff in
Washington, and the results will be carefully monitored over the coming months.

*

A key sub-sector, which merits a closer follow-up on implementation performance
within the portfolio, relates to the transport/roads sub-sector. All four roads
projects have significant undisbursed balances, the IP rating of the El Nino
Emergency project was downgraded while the Roads Sector Institutional Support
project is a "potential" problem project - largely a consequence of inadequate
capacity within the sector. However, progress is being made on the institutional
front in Uganda. A Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) is now operational and
should be able to cope with the present and planned workload, until the
establishment of a semi-autonomous road agency is in place by mid-2002.

*

Although attention to social sectors in the lending portfolio over the past several
years has grown with the Bank responding to the emerging challenges in Uganda's
human development performance, the effectiveness of services remains low. This is
an issue that will be a key focus of the proposed PRSC I operation; PRSC I will seek
to improve the quality of public service delivery in the areas of primary education,
basic health and water and sanitation. The Bank is also reviewing the modalities for
strengthening its support for Government efforts at containing the HIV/AIDS
pandemic.

*

Decentralizationfrom the center to the district councils is expected to be a major
challenge in the medium-term, but is affecting the implementation of some of the
projects (particularly, the ongoing or planned agriculture extension and social sector
interventions). Strengthening of local capacity and sound procedures for funding
district councils and a solid accountability framework need to be established.
