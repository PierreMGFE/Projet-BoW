OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
SaoTome and Principe is a small archipelagoof two islands,which has all the handicapsof a
small islandeconomybut has not begun to turn the few locationaladvantagesinto a source of progress
for its people. The United NationsHumanDevelopmentReport (1999) ranks Sao Tome and Principe
123rd out of 174 countries. Sao Tome and Principe has enjoyeda fully democraticpoliticalsystem
since 1991. It faces three main developmentchallengesat this time: (i) to developthe institutional
capacityneededto meet the demandsof a market-orientedeconomy;(ii) to develop both a dynamic
private sectorand a diversifiedeconomyso as to reversethe trend of low real GDP growth, declining
per capitaincomeand increasingpoverty;and (iii)to developits humanresources.
2.
Followinga decade of economicdecline and deterioratingsocial indicators, the authorities
implementedin 1998-99,a series of reformswithinthe framnework
of an IMF staff-monitoredprogram.
Progress was made in macroeconomicadjustmentand severalstructuralpolicymeasures. In the area
of oil exploration, the Governmentestablisheda unit in the office of the Prime Minister to oversee
policy in the oil sector, prepare the necessary legislation in the wake of oil production-sharing
negotiationswithExxon/Mobil,and ensure transparencyin thehandlingof futureoil operations.
3.
Althoughthe currentpoverty situationin Sao Tome and Principeis not well known,morethan
40 percent of the populationis estimatedliving below the povertyline (with an incomeof less than
US$ 220 per year), and a large numberof peopleare believedto be livingjust above the povertyline
and that it would take a relativelysmall declinein their incometo push them intoextremepoverty.In
addition,the unemploymentrate remainedhigh at about 35 percent in 1998. The Governmenthas
preparedan InterimPovertyReductionStrategyPaper (I-PRSP)that definesa broad set of actionsto
improve the living conditionsof the most vulnerablesegments of the population. A participative
process has been launchedwith a view to finalizinga full PRSPby end-December2001.
4.
IDA's strategyfor the period2000-05is to supportthe Government'sobjectivesaiming at: (a)
sustainingstrong economicgrowth to raise incomesand reduce poverty;and (b) broadeningaccess to
social servicesand improvingtheir quality. Given the limitedadministrativeresources,IDA's future
lending program in Sao Tome and Principewill be limitedto one project every two-threeyears. The
proposed Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC) and its supporting Technical Assistance
Project(PRM TA), which are beingpresentedtogetherwith this countrystrategy,aim at supportingthe
Government's goal of improvingits economicmanagementcapacity. However, opportunitiesfor
furtherBank lending may be consideredin support of the Govemment's Poverty ReductionStrategy
Paper and on the outcome of oil exploration and production activities, provided the PRMC is
satisfactorilyimplementedand a satisfactoryparticipativePRSP is prepared. Such opportunitiesare
possible in areas of human development(health, education and social protection) and support to
developmentof oil as a new growthsource.

ii
5.
The mainrisk is that the Government'sreformagenda encountersresistanceand incitessocial
unrest, particularlyin the period leadingup to the 2001 presidentialelection. Other risks are posed by
low institutionalcapacity,limited donor commitmentand lack of coordination,deterioratingpublic
infrastructureand a narrowprivate sector. Decliningexportearnings,and protractednegotiationswith
Nigeriaon the delimitationof the maritimeborder coulddistractthe Government'sattentionaway from
the reform agenda and result in a more difficulteconomicenvironment.To manage these risks, the
Governmentplans to: (i) gain the supportof the politicalparties,the businesscommunity,labor unions,
NGOs and the populationat large, as it did during the successful preparation of the I-PRSP; (ii)
strengthendonorcoordination;and, (iii)developlocal institutionalcapacity.
6.
Issues for ExecutiveDirectors' Discussion:given the above mentionedissues and risks as
well as the limited administrativeresources,is the proposed scenariofor lending and non-lending
servicesidentifiedin sectionV the most appropriaterole that the Bank can performto support
the Government'sdevelopmenteffort?

BACKGROUND

1.
Sao Tome and Principe is a small archipelagoof two islands,which has all the handicapsof a
small islandeconomybut has not begun to turn the few locationaladvantagesinto a sourceof progress
for its people' (Box 1). The latest availabledata (1994) put the proportionof the absolutepoor at over
40 percentof the population. This situationgrew worseover the remainderof the decadeof the 1990s,
when economicand social conditionsdeterioratedand a sizable externaldebt was accumulated. The
United NationsHuman DevelopmentReport (1999) ranks Sao Tome and Principe 123rd out of 174

1One of those advantagesis materializingin the form of prospectsof becomingan oil producer. Seismic surveys had

confurmedthe existence of deposits in potentiallycommercialquantities offshore. But there were uncertaintiesabout
ownershipof the area. Negotiationswithits neighbor,NigeriaconcludedinAugust2000, allowingfor collaborationon future
developmentof the fields. Nonetheless,it is unclearwhen Sao Tome and Principecan expectto start producingoil and by
howmuch.

Sao Tome and Principe CAS

2.
IDA has had a rather limitedinvolvementin Sao Tome and Principe (para.36) because of the
country's poor performanceafter 1986 (eight projects since membershipin 1985, two of which are
active). This limited involvementwas curtailedfurther after 1992 when the country's performance
slipped further. One consequence is that there has been little IDA's (or others) analysis of
developmentissues facing the country(a Public Finance Review in 1997 is the only Economicand
Sector Work in over a decade). The resulting limited knowledge base severely handicaps the
formulationof a CountryAssistanceStrategy.
3.
Sao Tomeand Principefacesthree maindevelopmentchallengesat this time:(i) to developthe
institutionalcapacity needed to meet the demands of a modem economy,including managing the
developmentand use of oil resources when this becomes a reality;(ii) to develop both a dynamic
privatesector and a diversifiedeconomyso as to reversethe trend of low real GDP growth, declining
per capita income and increasingpovertv;and (iii) to develop its human resources. To do so and
combat the high incidenceof poverty,the Governmenthas prepared and adopted an Interim Poverty
ReductionStrategyPaper (I-PRSP)2 that definesinitial povertyreduction measures and actions, and
also lays out a plan for developinga full PRSP. A committeewillbe establishedby December2000 to
overseeimplementationof the povertyreductionstrategyof the InterimPRSP and to monitorpoverty
indicators. A participativeprocesswith the civil societyhas been launchedwith a view to finalizingthe
fullPRSP (and hencean enlargedpovertyreductionprogram)by end-December2001.

RECENT ECONOMIC

AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

4.
From 1987 to 1997, Sao Tome and Principe experienced a profound economic and financial
crisis. An early attempt to staunch the crisis was made in 1990 when Sao Toren and Principe, vith the
support of the donor community, embarked upon an nifamiousrecovery and econotmic development

program. The results were poor owing mainlyto weak institutionalcapacity,the lack of adequately
skilledhuman resources,adverseexternalshocks- especiallythe declinein world cocoa prices- and
heavy relianceon aging cocoa plantations. Real GDP growth rates remained low, macroeconomic
imbalances worsened further, unemploymentincreased, and living conditions of the population
deteriorated.The annualreal GDP growth rate averagedabout 1.6percent over this period and income
per capitadecreasedfrom US$350 in 1987to aboutUS$300 in 1997.
Followingthat decade of economicdeclineand deterioratingsocial indicators,the authoritiesin
5.
1998-99implementedin earnest a series of reforms withinthe frameworkof an IMF staff-monitored
program. They made progress in strengtheningfiscalperformance,stabilizingthe exchangerate, and
loweringinflation. In parallel with macroeconomicadjustment,the Governmenthas implemented
severalstructuralpolicymeasures.
In order to broadenthe role of markets in resourceallocation,price controlswere eliminated;
6.
domestictrade, including the marketingof agriculturalproducts, was completelyliberalized;and a
mechanismwas introducedto automaticallyadjustpetroleumretailproductprices in line with changes
in internationalprices.
In the area of institutional development,initial steps were taken towards improvingpublic
7.
sector managementcapacitywith the Governmentadoptingnew organizationaland staffingplans for
each of its ten ministries; revising civil service regulations; initiating the preparation of an
administrativereformand a downsizingprogramto implementa full reformof the civilservice.
As part of a public enterprise sector reform and private sector developmentprogram, the
bankruptnationalsavings and loans institution(CNPC) was liquidatedand a loan recoveryprogram
established;the petroleumdistributioncompany(ENCO)was partiallyprivatizedand two hotels were
placed under private management;a law governingproperty rights was adopted that clarifies the
exercise of ownershiprights;and work was launchedto prepare a strategyfor privatizinggovernmentownedagriculturalestates and rationalizingthe land tenuresystem.

8.

In the area of trade and exchange,the export receiptssurrender requirementwas eliminated;
9.
all non-tariffimportbarriers were removedand externalcurrent accounttransactionswere liberalized;
and a comprehensivereformof the customs tariff structure and a plan to eliminateexport taxes were
adoptedtogetherwith the 2000 budget. This tariff reformsimplifiedthe tariffstructureto includeonly
3 rates and also reduced their levels (the highest rate is now 20 percent). With these trade
liberalizationreforms,the indexof tradepolicyrestrictivenessis estimatedto have been reducedto 5 in
1999,comparedto 10 in 1997-98.
In order to prepare for the oil era, the Governmentestablishedan administrativeunit in the
10.
officeof the PrimeMinisterthat wouldoverseegovernmentpolicyin the oil sector;handle legal issues
related to oil production-sharingnegotiationswith Exxon/Mobil, and ensure transparency in the
handlingof futureoil operations. TheBank and Norwayare assistingthis unit.
Sao Tome and Principe'seconomicperformanceimprovedduring 1998 and 1999. Real GDP
11.
growth averaged2.5 percent, up from 1 percent in 1997 althoughcocoa outputfell by 13 percent as a
result of unfavorableworld prices. Nevertheless,as progressin economicreforms began to alleviate
structural rigidities,the impact of the decline in cocoa productionwas more than offset by a rapid
expansionin trade, construction,and tourism. The inflationrate dropped substantiallyfrom over 80

Ill.

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

SdoTom6and Principe's economy,with its near-exclusivedependenceon one activity(cocoa)
12.
is very vulnerableto externalfactorsrelatedto volatilityand long-termunfavorabletrends in the price
of cocoa;heavydependenceon externalaid;and a large externaldebtburden.
13.
The countryis highlydependenton one export commodity,cocoa, which accountedfor about
90 percent of S1o T8e and Principe's export earings in 1997. As such, the impactof the sharp
swings in world cocoa prices(e.g. the declinefrom 167.8c/kgto 99.8c0kgbetweenJanuary 1998 and
August 1999 alone) and of the Thrips infestationcan be profound. Transportationcosts are high,
limniting
access to externalmarkets. The absenceof both a deep seaport and regular air transportnot
only constitutes a serious impedimentto SAo Tom6 and Principe's developmentbut also adds to
transactioncosts and limitsthe potentialfor exportingagriculturalproduction.
14.
Public investmentsdepend heavily on external aid, which has typicallyfinanced about 95
percent of S5oTorn6 and Principe's public investmentprogram. Sincethe early 80s, SAoTom6and
Principehas been amongthe top recipientsof foreignaid in Sub-SaharanAfrica(e.g. during 1975-84
each SdoTomeanreceived,in average,US$72 in net disbursementsof officialdevelopmentassistance,
while in 1985-89the amount was US$208, and in 1990-99 the amountwas US$447). Indications
from the recent Round Table meeting(Geneva- October5-6, 2000) are that Siio Tom6 and Principe

Sdo Tome and Principe CAS

5

will continue to require significant external assistance. But such high dependence on extemal
assistanceexacerbatesthe country's vulnerability.
15.
Sao Tome and Principe is also highly indebted. Its outstandingpublic externaldebt reached
US$296 millionat end-1999 or 627 percent of GDP. The proportionof debt owed to multilateral
creditorswas 58 percent or US$169.7million,of whichUS$65 millionwere owed to IDA. The stock
of arrears continuallyincreasedduring 1996-99because Sao Tome and Principe stopped servicingits
debt to all officialbilateralcreditors(exceptFrance and Cape Verde) in 1996. Sao Tom6and Principe
debt serviceratio in 1999 was equivalentto 49.6 percentof exports of goods and non-factorservices.
In 1999, Sao Tome and Principe eliminatedits non-reschedulableexternal arrears and continuedto
serviceits extemaldebt to multilateralinstitutions.The Paris Club grantedto SaoTome and Principea
reschedulingof its bilateral debton Naples terms on May 16, 2000. The Governmentis committedto
strengthendebt managementand to establisha good implementationtrack record of reformsthat would
allow Sao Tomr and Principe to request debt relief under the H[PC Initiative. The adoptionof a
programin 2000 that is supportedby the IMF's PovertyReductionGrowthFacility(PRGF)improves
chancesof the country's accessto the HIPC Initiative.
16.
The Governmentrecognizesthe abovevulnerabilitiesand is taking measures in the areas of
macroeconomicstabilization and structural reforms so as to improve Sao Tome and Principe's
developmentprospects. In addition,Sao Tome and Principe's high degree of dependenceon external
aid makesthe countryextremelyvulnerableto changesin the externalaid climateand also underscores
the importancefor the authoritiesof strengtheningdomestic resourcemobilizationand of creatingan
environmentconducive to private sector developmentand foreign direct private investment and,
indeed,these are amongthe major objectivesof the economicpolicy package being supportedby the
WorldBank,the IMF and otherdonors.

IV.

MAJOR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AND POLICIES

17.
Sao Tom6 and Principe displays the economic, environmental, political and social
characteristicsthat afflictmany small states (the small island syndrome),including remotenessand
insularity;susceptibilityto natural disasters; limited institutionalcapacity; a narrow resource base;
vulnerabilityto externalshocks;limited accessto externalcapital; and entrenchedpoverty3 . Many of
these are conditionsthat call for collective(publicsector)action. Under these conditions,there is great
premium on setting developmentpriorities;creatinga policy environmentto promote private sector
activities;and efficientlyperformingthe public sector functionsof mobilizingand allocatingresources
in line with clear povertyreductionobjectives. This implies that the Governmentneeds to maintain
macroeconomicstabilityand eliminatestructural rigiditiesso as to facilitate strong and sustainable
economicgrowth and employment,led by the private sector; and be efficient in the areas of public
sector action.

Institutional Capacity and Economic Management
18.
Sao Tomeand Principe'spublic sectoris characterizedby a weak institutionalcapacity,limited
financialresources,poor workingenvironment,an oversizedcivil service and high transactioncosts,
compoundedwith a lack of effectivedonor coordinationand a general unreliabilityof donor flows.
This makesthe exerciseof publicsectorfunctionand soundpublicresource managementdifficult. To
correct this situation, the Governmenthas adopted new organizationaland staffing plans for the
administrationand is preparing,with donors' assistance,a full administrativereform,which includesa
civil service retrenchmentprogram. This will be done by realigningthe roles and functionsof each
ministry, mapping functional responsibilitiesand introducing new management capacities. An
importantaspectof these reformswillbe the establishmentof effectivelinkagesbetween development
planning,policymaking,resourceallocationand staffingdeployment.

system, and developinga public sector

time. But in many other areas, progress could be made quicklythat would send a powerful signal
aboutthe Government'sdeterminationto addressthese issues.
,

20.
The Governmentis determinedto strengthengood governanceby increasingthe transparency
of all of its financialoperations,taking into account current institutionalweaknessesand the need to
strengthenadministrativecapacity,in light of oil productionprospects. It will judiciallyprocess any
reportedacts of fraud or corruption. Measures have alreadybeen taken to enhancetransparency. The
centralbank and public enterprisesare now committedto have their books audited everyyear by an
independentexternal auditor. Strengthenedintemal audit procedures at the central bank will help
increasethe level of transparencyin the managementof public affairs. Furthermore,the streamlining
of the customstariff and domesticindirecttaxation,and the eliminationof ad hoc exemptions,together
with the strengtheningof intemal audit units at the Directoratesof Finance and Customs, will help
prevent and combat fraud and corruptionmore effectively. As regards to the oil sector activities,the
Government intends to ensure transparency in future operations and in the preparation of the
Govenmment's
oil policy.
21.
In the area of economic management, improvementin the efficiencywith which public
resources are mobilizedand public servicesare deliveredwill be importantin raising private sector
responsivenessto an improved incentive structure and in broadeningaccess to social services and

Sao Tome and Principe CAS

7

improvingtheir quality. Notwithstandingmarked improvementin overalleconomicmanagementover
the last two years, the macroeconomicsituationremainsfragileand sensitiveto regionaldevelopments;
and there are often delays or shortfallsin annual aid disbursements,which tend to exacerbate the
effectsof anyfiscal slippages.
Key issues to be tackled in the area of public resource management are: (a) sustained
22.
improvementin revenue mobilization;(b) restructuringof current expenditures;and (c) strengthening
publicinvestmentprogramming.
Sustained improvement in resource mobilization calls for strengthening the customs
23.
administration (actions are underway with assistance of the IDA, EU, UNCTAD, France and
Portugal),broadeningthe tax base, and enhancingthe transparencyof tax policies. Reforms under
implementationare expectedto contributeto an increasein currentrevenuefrom 23.7 percent of GDP
in 1999to 26.9 percentby 2002.
Progress in restructuring current expenditures, notably in changing the pattern and
24.
compositionof recurrent expenditure,and in improvingtheir efficiency,has remainedmodest. The
progress made in reducing overall recurrent expenditures,has yet to be translated into expenditure
patterns that support the Government'sstated developmentobjectives:human resource development,
povertyalleviationand economicinfrastructuremaintenance.Withinthe socialsectors, there has been
some shift in expendituresto operationsand materialsin educationand health, but still too little is
allocatedto materials,whichteachers andhealth workersneedto performtheirjobs properly. It is vital
not only that these increasestake place, but that the public expenditureprograms emphasizequality,
efficiencyand effectivenessin the use of public resources. Indicators for the cost-effectiveuse of
public resourcesare not available,makingit difficultto make intra-and inter-sectoralcomparisons.
The coverageof the rollingpublic investmentprogram (PIP)needs to be broadenedto cover
25.
all sectors by 2000/2001, thus facilitatinggreater consistencybetween the PIP and the outlayson
operationsand maintenanceprovided for in the recurrent budget. Moreover, the Governmentwill
continueits policyof not subsidizingthe operatingcosts of public enterprisesand containingthe civil
servicewage bill. Althoughsome progresshas been made in estimatingand linkingthe impactof the
investmentbudget on the recurrentbudget, the plannedbroadeningof a public expenditureprogram
(PEP) to all sectors would help to integratebetter the PIP within regular budgetary management
procedures.
Economic Diversification, Private Sector Development and Environmental Protection
The policy reforms undertaken so far have paved the way toward creating an enabling
26.
environmentfor the private sector: marketdeterminedexchangeand interest rates, price liberalization,
absence of restrictionson employmentor capital repatriation,low average import duties, abolitionof
quantitativerestrictionsand exporttaxes, and privatizationof several parastatals. While maintenance
of macro-economicstabilityis importantin attractingprivate sector investment,in particular,in the
tourismsector,its developmentwill continueto be constrainedby inadequatefinancialintermediation,
lack of cost-effectiveinfrastructure,includingutilitiesand transportation,malfunctioningof the court
system, and customs and tax administration. The Governrmentrecently prepared, with FIAS

8

assistance, a medium-termstrategy for private sector developmentand, the Governmentwill also
implement a divestitureprogram4 . The promotionof a dynamic private sector, particularlyin the
agricultureand tourism sectors, and the accelerationof the implementationof a divestitureprogram
will be one potential source of revenue enhancement,especiallyif such revenues could be used to
financeincreasedsocialexpenditure.
27.
In a countrywhere 56 percent of the populationdepends on agricultureand where the annual
population growth rate is relatively high (2.4 percent per annum), developing a sustainable and
diversifiedagricultureand preserving the environmentis of paramount importancefor growth and
development. Furthermore,povertyis so pervasivein the rural areas of Sao Tome and Principe that
poverty alleviationmust be contingenton a thriving agriculturalsector. Growth in agriculturewill
require improvementsin productivity,diversificationof production and improved natural resource
management. Measurestaken so far to attaintheseobjectivesare: liberalizationof prices, government
withdrawalfrom output marketingand input supply, restructuringof the Ministry of Agricultureto
providebetter research and extensionof servicesto farmers. This has created scope for a stronger
private sector role, for which they need financing. For further agriculturalgrowth, it will also be
importantto promotefarmerparticipationand self-managementin their plots, watermanagement,rural
savingsand loans,trainingof ruralentrepreneursand ruralsocialinfrastructure.
28.
In addition,Sao Tome and Principeare hometo the second most importantprimary forestsout
of 75 sites in Africa. Many bird and animalspecies are endemicto the country,and especiallyon the
less inhabitedPrincipeIsland,there may be as yet undiscoveredspecies. Any loss of biodiversityand
productivityof the environmentwouldfurtherlower livingstandards. The Government'scommitment
to environmentalprotectionis illustratedby its NationalStrategyfor the Protectionof the Environment
and SustainableDevelopment,scheduled to be formally adopted by the end of 2000. Legislation
pertainingto the protectionof forests was drafted with the help of the United Nations Environment
Program(UNEP) and adopted by the Parliarnentin 1998. Measuresto protect the urban environment
would focus on improved treatment of water supply, sanitation,drainage and adequate garbage
disposal.
29.
Tourism could also be another key growth sector in Sao Tome and Principe, if critical
administrativeand basic infrastructurebottlenecksfor privateinvestmentin the sectorare eliminated.
Human Resource Development
30.
Sao Tom6 and Principe's social indicators, which several years ago were better than the
average for sub-SaharanAfrica,have significantlydeteriorated(Box 3). In particular,while SaoTome
and Principe'seducation indicators were among the best in sub-Saharan Africa through 1990, the
situation of the educationalinfrastructurehas sharply deterioratedin the last decade. The overall
qualityof educationhas declinedas a resultof the lack of classrooms,sufficientand suitabletextbooks,
and a lack of professionaland qualified teachers (only 45 percent of teachers are qualified). To
The PE sector comprises 22 PEs, of which eight are in the rural sector. The Government will (i) liquidate two (2) companies,
a meat processing concern (ENCAR) and medicine distribution company (ENAMED); and (ii) privatize a hotel (Pousada Boa
Vista), a palm-oil development company (EMOLVE), a construction material distribution company (Cunha Gomes), the
national airline (Air Sao Tome) and the water and electricity enterprise (EMAE).

respondto the high studentdemandfor a very small numberof classes, the Governmentdecidedto use
both doubleand triple shift classrooms. These shiftsare conductedby the same teacherand take place
the samneday, meaning that children have only 4 hours of class time per day. Consequently,the
system's effectivenesshas declinedsince 1990. Gross primaryenrollmentrate decreasedfrom 82.5
percent of school-agepopulationin 1990 to 60 percent in 1996, before increasingto 70 percent in
1999. During 1996-99,total repetitionrate stood at 31 percentof total enrollmentin primaryschools
and more than 30 percent of the school childrendrop out before reachingthe sixth grade. Data also
indicatethat the numberof girls who drop out of schoolis higherthan boys.
Aware of the critical role of education in the mobilizationof the country's potential for
31.
economicgrowth and povertyreduction,the Governmentwill prepare a broad developmentpolicy for
the sector which will: (a) promote equal access to the educational system at all levels, without
discrimination;and (b) improvethe qualityof education,boostthe gross primary schoolenrollmentrate
from 70 percentin 1999to 90 percentin 2002, eventuallyachievinguniversalenrollmentby 2005. The
Governmentalso intends to raise the adult literacy rate, eliminatedouble and triple shift classes in
primaryschools(therebyincreasingthe averageschoolday from4 to 7 hours daily). Primaryschooling
will be extended to the fifth and sixth grades, and the quality of secondary education improved.
Developmentof technicaland vocationaltrainingwillalso be necessaryto meet the country's economic
and social developmentneeds. For this reason, in additionto general education,the Governmentwill
developmodularvocationaltrainingwhileenhancingapprenticeshiptrainingon a broad scale.

immediatelyafter fourth grade. Often, evenyoungerchildrenare involvedin hazardouslabor, such as
breakingstonesfor construction,metalworkingand mechanics.The Bank willwork with other donors
to addressthis issue.
Sao Tomeand Principe'shealth indicators,which werebetter thanthe average for sub-Saharan
33.
Aftica, are currentlydeteriorating,as witnessedby the recent dramaticrise in infantmortalityrate from
50 per thousandof live births in 1996 to 65 per thousandin 1999. Maternalmortalityis estimatedto
have remainedat 122 per thousandof live births in 1996-99and the total mortalityrate increasedfrom
8.3 per thousandin 1996to 8.5 per thousandin 1997. The leadingcause of mortalityand morbidityfor
all age groups is malaria. A 2000 UNICEF report indicatesthat malaria accountsfor more than 60
percentof patientsadmittedto hospitalsor that have beenseen in districthealth centers.
The Governmentwill formulatea nationalpolicy on health improvementcovering 2000-05,
34.
centered around four priority areas of intervention:(i) preventing and combating major illnesses
(malaria,respiratoryillnesses,acute diarrhea,tuberculosis,HIV/AIDS,and other sexuallytransmitted
diseases); (ii) improving primary health care by intensifyingpublic information, education, and
communication(lEC) campaigns, developing basic infrastructure and improving the quality of
preventivehealth care; (iii) improvingmedicalcare by upgradingmanagementof the centralhospital
(by ensuring administrativeand financialautonomy) and providing better facilities and diagnostic
support services;and (iv) strengtheningthe nationalhealth system by adoptinga health development
policy, reorganizingthe supply and distributionof essential drugs, creating an effectiveinformation
system for managementand planning,and upgradinghealth workers' trainingand career streams. The
Governmentwill also strengthenoutpatients'facilitiesand improvelocal managementat the district
level, particularly in rural areas, with a view to decentralizing services and promoting local
participationin the developmentof health policiesand the managementof healthunits.

Regardingwater and sanitation,the Governmentintendsto focus its activitieson strategicand
regulatory issues, and thus encourage increased private sector participation. In the area of urban
developmentand rehabilitationof poor neighborhoods,it will restructureareas of difficultaccess. It
will also rehabilitateroad, drainage and sanitationnetworksin slum areas and in the plantationsand
will providepotablewater in the urban centers, under a privatizedmanagementsystem of standpipes.
Theseinvestmentswill contributeto improvementsin the environment,and a reductionin the incidence
of diseases, such as malaria and cholera. Throughthe involvementof local firms, micro-enterprises
and NGOs, employmentwillbe createdto executeand maintaintheseinvestments.
V.

THE BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

36.
Past Assistance to Sao Tome and Principe. IDA's assistanceto Sao Tome and Principe,
which beganin 1985,has been limited. It has consistedof eightIDA credits totalingUS$ 61.9 million,
eight IDFs and one commercialdebt buy back operation totaling US$1.8 million, and a recently
approved PPIAF grant of US$175,000. The eight IDA credits (6 closed, 2 active) include a
modernizationline of credit (FY85),two adjustmentoperations(SALI, FY87 and SAC IUTA,FY90),
two agriculturalprojects(cocoa,FY87 and agriculturesector,FY92), two multi-sectorprojects (FY89
and FY91), and a health and educationproject (FY92). The agriculturaland the health and education
projects are active and scheduledto be closed at end 2000 and June 2001 respectively. Since 1992
there has been no IDA lending. Sao Tomeand Principeis not a memberof IFC or MIGA.
37.
Past Performanceand Lessons Learned. Out of the six closedprojects, three have been
rated as satisfactoryby the Bank's OperationsEvaluationDepartment(OED). This high failure rate
points to severallessons. The principallesson learnedis that project design should be kept simple to
accommodateSao Tome and Principe's limited and weak institutionaland administrativecapacity.
Other lessonsare: (a) while it is importantto providethe needed assistanceto a countryon a timely
basis, it is equally important to ensure that the implementationarrangements and monitoring
mechanismsare in place to ensure that the project will be implementedas planned; (b) IDA should
allowfor sufficientimplementationsupport,includingthroughexpatriateadvisors;(c) politicalstability
and sustained Governmentcommitmentare essential; (d) flexibility in program implementationis
necessaryto respondto evolvingsituations,and the performancecriteria shouldbe suited to countryspecificconditionsand be monitoredclosely;and (e) donor coordinationis fundamentalto improving
the efficiencyand efficacyof externalassistance.
38.
ProposedNew AssistanceStrategy. IDA's strategyfor the period2000-05 is to supportthe
Governmentin the pursuit of its objectivesas set forth in the I-PRSP: (a) sustainingstrong economic
growth to raise incomes and reduce poverty; and (b) broadening access to social services and
improvingtheir quality. Given the high likelihoodthat IDA lending and administrativebudgets
allocated to Sao Tome and Principe will remain limited, the support to the country will have to be
deliveredthroughthe existingportfolioof two projectsand a multisectorapproachwithinthe selected
new lending(para.40).
39.
Use of Existing Portfolio. The ongoing Agricultural Privatization and Smallholder
DevelopmentProject(US$9.8 million,FY92) aimsto increaseand diversifyagriculturalproductionby
privatizing a major part of the publicly-ownedestate sector, and promote smallholderproductivity.
Rural povertyalleviationand environmentalprotectionare other objectivesof the project. This project
assisted much of the work during 1998-2000 on the privatizationof state-owned estates and the

Sdo Tome and Principe CAS

11

expansionof small holderactivity. The remainingundisbursedamount(US$0.7 million)will support
the finalizationof work on the land tenure system (para. 8). In the social sectors, the Health and
EducationProject(US$ 11.4 million,FY92) aimsto reversethe declinein the health and educational
status through, in the health sector, a malariaeradicationand controlprogram and the provisionof
drugs; and in the educationsector, the provisionof textbooks and schools supplies and improved
schoolinspection.Planningcapacitieswouldbe strengthenedin both sectors. Duringthe period200001, the remainingresources in this Credit (US$3.1 million)will be focussedon increasingaccessto
schooling(rehabilitationof classroomsand provisionof teachingmaterial).
40.
Proposed New Lending. IDA's future lending program in Sao Tome and Principe will
remainlimitedas in thepast and we expectto prepareor cofinanceone project everytwo-threeyears.
The proposedPublic ResourceManagementCreditand its supportingTechnical AssistanceProject
(FY01),seek to tacklethe heart of the institutionaland economicmanagementcapacityproblem. The
PRMC is the appropriateinstrumentto put in place at this time as it makesresourcesavailableto: (i)
strengthenthe Government's capacity to mobilizeand manage public resources; and (ii) finance
selectedreforms, as well as fund analyticalstudies in key areas. Its formulationtakes into account
important lessons learned from past operations such as focus, timely assistance (use of quickdisbursinginstrument),and availabilityof externalexpertise. Opportunitiesfor furtherBank lending
maybe consideredin the contextof the Government'sPovertyReductionStrategyPaper (PRSP),the
policypaper on strategicoptions and actionplan for the period2000-05,and on the results of ongoing
and planned activitiesin oil explorationand production. Such opportunitiesare possible in areas of
humandevelopment(healthand education)and support to buildingthe capacityfor petroleumpolicy
and management.Theywillbe conditionalon the successfulimplementationof the PRMC.
41.
Economicand Sector Work (ESW). RegardingESW, IDA is supporting, through IDF
grants, the preparationof a full PRSP, PERs in educationand health, and sectoral and econoric
analyticalworkin the areasof civilservicereform,planningand budgetingof public expenditure,and
publicutilitiestarification.Beyondthis, no othereconomicand sectorwork is envisagedfor SaoTome
and Principe, given the limited administrativeresources and the need for selectivity. For
macroeconornicupdating, IDA will rely on the IMF. However, the proposed Public Resource
ManagementCreditwill financea StudyFundto carryout policy reformstudies (trade liberalization,
tax system,PERs, fiscal reform);sectoralstrategies(diversificationof agricultureproduction,tourism,
fisheries,public utilities,private sector development,bankingand financialsector reform, transport,
educationand health); and simulationmodels. In addition,the Study Fund will also finance staff
trainingand contributeto the operatingcost of a PetroleumAuthorityUnit.
42.
Policy Dialogue. Bank and IMF staffshavesupportedthe Government'seffortsto strengthen
macroeconomicmanagementand futuregrowth prospects. During the period 1999/2000,Bank/lMF
joint missionsreviewedeconomicdevelopmentsin the recent years and assisted the Govemmentin
preparingmacro and structuralpolicyreformsneededto enhanceSao Tome and Principe's prospects
for growth and social development. The Governmentof Sao Tome and Principe agrees with the
recommendationsof the WB/AMFmissionsand has begun to implementmeasures under the IMFPRGF. This formof assistancewillcontinueduring2000-05.
43.
CapacityBuilding. All IDA projectsin Sao Tome and Principehave includedcomponentsof
institutionaldevelopment.The Bank has also grantedSao Tome and PrincipeeightIDFs and a PPIAF
aimed at buildinglocal institutionalcapacityin the area of economicmanagement. In addition,the

12

Sdo Tome and Principe CAS

IMF, AfDB, UNDP, EU, France and Portugalare providingSao Tome and Principewith technical
assistanceaimedat developinglocal institutionalcapacityat the macroand sectorallevels.
44.
Role of Donors and Aid Coordination.The Government'soverall aid coordinationin Sao
Tom6 and Principeis weak. IDA has workedcloselywith UNDP in supportingthe GenevaRound
Table Meeting. This took place on October 5-6, 2000. In the meantime,UNDP is planningto
organizelocal donor meetingson the health sector,populationissues and capacitybuilding. IDA is
workingcloselywith other donors in the design and implementationof their assistanceprograms for
Sao Tome and Principe:with the EU in the areas of structuraladjustment,infrastructureand capacity
building;withthe AfDB in the area ofpovertyreductionand povertyanalysis;with IFAD in the area of
land reform in the agriculturesector; with France in the area of economicmanagementand rural
services; with Norway in the area of oil policy; and with Portugal in the areas of human resource
developmentand povertyreduction. Taiwan,China,has emerged,sinceearly 1998,as the largestaid
donorto Sao Tome and Principe. An understandingreached betweenthe two governmentsprovides
for possibleannualassistanceto Sao Tom6and Principeof the order of US$10 millionequivalentper
year.
45.
Sao Tome and Principeis on a bi-annualconsultationcycle with the IMF;the latest ArticleIV
Consultationreportwas discussedby the IMF Board in April 28, 2000. The IMF Board also approved
in April28, 2000,a three-yeararrangementunderthe PovertyReductionand GrowthFacility(PRGF).
46.
Risks. The main risk is that the proposed reform agenda encountersresistance and incites
social unrest, particularlyin the period leadingup to the 2001 presidentialelection. Other risks are
posed by low insfitutionalcapacity,limiteddonors' commitmentand lack of coordinationand a narrow
private sector. Decliningexport earnings,and protractednegotiationswith Nigeriaon the delimitation
of the maritimeborder could distractthe Government'sattentionaway from the reformagenda. That
couldlead to partial implementationof the program,or to excessivedelaysor even policy reversals,
particularly if recovery of the economy is slower than expected. To manage these risks, the
Governmentplans to: (i) hamess the support of the politicalparties, the business community,labor
unions,NGOsand thepopulationat large,as it did duringthe successfilpreparationof the I-PRSP;(ii)
strengthendonorcoordinationincluding,holdinga DonorRoundTable meetingin October2000; and
(iii)developlocalinstitutionalcapacity.
