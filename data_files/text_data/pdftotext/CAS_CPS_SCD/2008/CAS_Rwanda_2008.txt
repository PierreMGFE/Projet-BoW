EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Rwanda has made remarkable progress since the 1994 genocide and civil war. Peace and
political stability have been re-established, reconciliation efforts are continuing, and democratic
institutions and processes are being strengthened. Poverty and social indicators have also improved.
Given the considerable ground lost during the genocide and civil war Rwanda i s s t i l l behind comparators
in the region on key economic and social indicators. Rwanda’s key challenge going forward i s to
leverage i t s recent progress for a much higher development path that will put the country’s long
term economic and social aspirations within reach.

ii.
The spectacular growth effects of Rwanda’s post-conflict reconstruction appears to be fully
exhausted and growth has now slowed. Much higher growth rates are needed to significantly reduce
poverty and move towards the objective o f middle income status. This requires transformation o f the
economy in the following ways: (i)higher productivity and commercial orientation o f agriculture; (ii)
broad access to key infrastructure at a much lower cost; (iii)a modem and dynamic private sector able to
lead growth; (iv) diversified base o f economic activities; and (v) full integration into Eastern and
Southern Africa.
iii.
Significant investment in developing human capital i s needed to fully harness Rwanda’s
most important asset-its population-for development. The challenges are: (i)a severe deficit o f
labor market skills due in part t o the absence o f an integrated policy for post-basic education-this deficit
i s evident in the much higher than average wages for skilled personnel in Rwanda than in other parts o f
the region; (ii)low quality o f education following rapid progress in expanding access particularly at the
primary level; (iii)child and maternal mortality rates amongst the highest on the continent due to
physical, geographic, and financial barriers to accessing high-quality services and to behavioral and
cultural factors; and (iv) addressing the needs o f the different populations o f vulnerable groups.
iv.
Strengthening public institutions including several that have been created within the last
decade i s critical for achieving more rapid development progress. Core public sector functions
require strengthening, particularly at the decentralized level and support i s needed for civil society to
emerge as a more effective development actor, able to hold government accountable.
v.
Rwanda’s long term development vision articulated in the Rwanda Vision 2020 document i s
to become a lower middle income economy (US$900 per capita) operating as a knowledge-based
service hub by 2020. Within this long term vision the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (EDPRS) assigns the highest priority to accelerating growth to create employment and generate
exports. The strategy i s framed around three strategic flagship programs:
Flagship one (Growth) targets economy wide improvements in productivity. I t s goal i s t o transform
Rwanda’s economy from subsistence agriculture towards increased commercial agriculture, as well as
manufacturing and services.
Flagship two (Vision 2020 Umurenge) focuses on ensuring growth i s shared by creating economic
opportunities for the poorest Rwandans. It has three components: (i)public works; (ii)credit
packages; and (iii)direct supports.
Flagship three (Governance) seeks to strengthen political and economic governance, and build
institutions and capacity o f the state. It envisages a wide range o f reforms t o strengthen public sector
institutions and capacity and also includes aspects needed to create an attractive business environment
including strengthening commercial justice systems, regulatory and administrative frameworks, and
promoting principles o f good corporate governance.

vi.
The World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda for FY09-12 has
been jointly prepared by IDA, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in an effort to draw greater synergies from our work and

1

catalyze higher volumes of private resources to support Rwanda’s development. It i s closely aligned
with the EDPRS and seeks stronger impact through greater selectivity in line with Government o f
Rwanda’s (GoR) preferences for engagement with the Bank and enhanced harmonization with other
donors. N o new financing from the International Development Association (IDA) i s envisaged for
Primary Education, HIV/AIDS, Urban Management, Water and Sanitation, and Civil Service Reform.

vii.
0

The CAS i s framed around two strategic themes:
Promote economic transformation and growth. The primary objective o f the CAS i s to help
Rwanda make progress in activating new drivers of growth that can be sustained over time. The
substantial part o f the financial envelope over the period will therefore support the EDPRS flagship
on growth and focus on four key outcomes: (i)raising agricultural production in a sustainable way;
(ii) improving access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services; (iii)improving the
environment for private sector development; and (iv) strengthening management o f public resources
at central and local levels.
Reduce social vulnerability. A secondary objective i s to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans
also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress in building a more stable society.
Building on progress to date in reform and development of delivery of basic services, a smaller
program will involve support to the Flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge (village) initiative; reducing
vulnerability of Rwandan children and mothers to high rates of mortality; and promoting peace and
social cohesion through demobilization and reintegration. It will seek to contribute to mitigating
health and social risks-to vulnerable groups and to social cohesion in Rwanda.

These themes will be supported through a series of Poverty Reduction Strategy Grants
viii.
(PRSG) and select investment lending in the indicative total amount of SDR 344 million (about
U S 5 6 1 equivalent) during FY09-12. Actual allocations during the CAS period will be determined on
an annual basis and will depend on: (i)
total IDA resources available; (ii)
Rwanda’s performance rating
relative to that o f other IDA borrowers; (iii)financing terms (credits or grants); and (iv) number o f IDAeligible countries. Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) will be used strategically to complement
financial support.

ix.
Harmonization with other development players will be enhanced under the CAS. This will
be done through mechanisms such as the recently agreed Common Performance Assessment Framework
which provides an opportunity for the Bank to harmonize i t s Budget Support Program and dialogue with
those of other budget support donors; through the preparation o f Sector-Wide Approach (SWAps)
particularly in the sectors where the Bank i s a lead donor -here we can play an even stronger role in
facilitating harmonization and alignment o f other donors in the sectors; and through specific initiative
such as the enhanced harmonization and collaboration between the World Bank, the AfDB and the EC,
particularly in the area of Budget Support, Public Financial Management and Infrastructure. We will also
seek greater collaboration with non traditional stakeholders and potential financers as well as various
philanthropic organizations that are increasingly active in Rwanda.
The overall outlook for Rwanda i s positive. But there are nonetheless risks that could
x.
derail the implementation of the CAS o r limit its impact. These include: (i)weak implementation
capacity particularly at the decentralized levels; (ii)regional neighborhood risks including the threat of
conflict and political instability in the region; the country’s landlocked location which could negatively
affect trade, export and private sector growth; and risks from migratory diseases that could impact
Rwanda; (iii)exogenous shocks given the limited diversification of the economy; and (iv) potential
instability related to parliamentary elections in 2008 and presidential elections in 2010. These risks can
be reduced through measures such as mainstreaming support to capacity building; greater emphasis on
regional transport; and strong support to Vision 2020 implementation. Food prices in Rwanda have risen
steadily over the past two years and could be exacerbated by any declines in agricultural productivity.
Support to sustainably raising domestic agricultural productivity remains critical for containing this risk.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
Almost a decade and a half after the devastating genocide and civil war, Rwanda has made
remarkable progress in rebuilding its politics, economy and society, implementing bold reforms.
The World Bank has supported this progress through two assistance strategies and one interim strategy.
The first Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to Executive Directors in March
1998 to support Rwanda’s transition effort from war to peace. In December 2002, Bank Executive
Directors discussed a second CAS supporting implementation o f Rwanda’s first Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) with a focus on laying the foundations for growth and sustainable human
development.
2.

3.
An Interim Strategy Note (ISN) discussed by the Board in August 2006 extended the second
CAS while the Government completed preparation o f i t s second PRSP-the Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS)-allowing this new CAS to be directly aligned with the EDPRS.
4.
This CAS, based on Rwanda’s EDPRS, will build on the foundation laid in previous
strategies and support a strong push on Rwanda’s growth agenda. It provides the framework for
World Bank Group (IDA, IFC and MIGA) support to Rwanda for the period 2009-2012. Guiding
principles for engagement include: alignment with the EDPRS, selectivity for greater impact,
government’s preferences for engagement with the Bank, and enhanced harmonization with other donors.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Politics and Governance

5.
Since the 1994 genocide, politics and governance in Rwanda have been shaped by two key
objectives: (i)ending the recurring cycle of ethnic based political violence that has characterized
post-independence history; and (ii) reducing the role and control o f the central government in
decision making and development action. To achieve these objectives, Rwanda has sought to create a
more inclusive form o f governance based on one national identity and using political arrangements,
processes and institutions that are largely homegrown, rooted in Rwandan culture and traditions. The
Constitution provides for political power sharing between the main political parties and extra effort i s
made by the authorities to seek consensus and avoid divisions. The President cannot appoint more than
50 percent o f cabinet members from hidher party and the speaker o f the parliament has to come from the
minority party. The Constitution also provides for strong political participation o f women allocating them
at least 30 percent o f positions in all higher level institutions. Women currently hold 49 percent o f
parliamentary seats and 36 percent o f cabinet positions.
6.
I n parallel, a bold decentralization program i s underway. This aims to provide equitable,
efficient, and effective pro-poor service delivery, while promoting local development in an environment
of good governance. I t seeks to foster citizens’ participation and empowerment as well as transparency
and (upward/downward) accountability. In the last two years, resource transfers to districts have risen
significantly in line with regulations for fiscal decentralization. Several institutions for democratic
governance are also being strengthened or created from scratch and avenues are being provided for
greater participation o f citizens in governance.

1

7.
So far, Rwanda’s approach to promoting inclusive and stable politics and governance
appears to be working. The country i s at peace and among the most stable on the continent.
Parliamentary elections in October 2008 and Presidential elections scheduled for 20 10 provide further
opportunity to deepen Rwanda’s process o f democratization. Sustained success will depend on
willingness to monitor results, draw lessons and political commitment to refine the model on the basis o f
this evidence.
Rwanda’s progress in building internal security and political stability i s also vulnerable to
8.
continued political instability in Eastern DRC. On November 9, 2007 the Governments o f D R C and
Rwanda signed a communique in Nairobi pledging to work together more closely t o achieve peace and
stability in Eastern DRC. In January 2008, the Government o f DRC signed a peace accord with over 20
militia groups operating in the country. Both the United Nations (UN) and the Government o f the D R C
now appear ready to address more forcefully the issue o f the remaining Rwandan rebel troops o f the
Forces De‘mocratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR) operating out o f the DRC. UN Security
Council resolution 1804, adopted on March 13, 2008, exhorts the FDLR and all Rwandan armed groups
to lay down their weapons and peacefully return to Rwanda. Effective implementation o f these
agreements and statements will greatly enhance prospects for lasting peace in Eastern DRC, thus creating
a key condition for lasting political peace and security for Rwanda.

B. The Economy
Macroeconomic Management and Debt Sustainability
Rwanda has continued to perform well under i t s program with the IMF. Inflation was
9.
brought down t o 6.6 percent by end 2007 from 12 percent at end 2006. Nevertheless core inflation
(excluding food and energy) has been rising. Growth in domestic revenue receipts due to overall growth,
tax collection efficiency improvements, and recovery o f arrears has allowed expansion in government
spending (over 30 percent between 2005 and 2007) with limited widening o f the fiscal deficit. In fact
deficit levels have tended to be lower than program targets.

10.
With considerable fiscal expansion and limited instruments for monetary policy, monetary
management has become an increasing challenge over the past two years. The National Bank o f
Rwanda (NBR) carried out large sterilization operations in the face o f rapid fiscal expansion in the second
half o f 2007. Reserve money targets were met but at the expense o f much broader money levels (about
30 percent higher than programmed)’ as well as higher stock o f domestic debt. These trends from the
second half o f 2007 continued in early 2008. Further strengthening o f the coordination between fiscal
and monetary policy i s needed.

11.
Higher than expected private transfers and mineral exports have helped keep Rwanda’s
external account deficit in check in the face of reduction in agricultural export receipts and growing
imports. The current account deficit (excluding grants) in 2007 was 16 percent o f GDP, lower than what
was projected in the program. International reserves have also exceeded program targets reflecting
higher-than-programmed disbursements o f external grants and loans. Rwanda has gradually introduced
more flexibility in the exchange rate regime using a managed float. The Rwandan franc has remained
broadly stable against the U.S. dollar and thus depreciated against other major world currencies in line
with the U.S. dollar. The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 6 percent year-on-year at end
2007, while the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 4 percent.

’

Sterilization operations kept end-month reserve money within the targets, but average intra-month reserve money exceeded the
end-month targets.

2

12.
Participation in the HIPC and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) has reduced
Rwanda’s external debt to a sustainable level (17 percent o f GDP) although the external debt
burden increased faster than programmed in 2007.2 In line with agreements reached with the MF,
the Government i s following policies to ensure that the external debt burden continues to be sustainable.
External debts are limited to loans with minimum o f 50 percent grant element and volumes are being kept
consistent with debt sustainability analysis3. A comprehensive debt strategy i s expected to be completed
by end 2008. Rwanda has also built external reserves equivalent to close to 6 months o f imports.
13.
As a highly aid dependent economy, a key macroeconomic management issue i s avoiding
the potential adverse macroeconomic effects o f high aid flows. A recent study4 concluded that the
rapid aid increase since 2003 has caused a number o f macro-economic management problems, including
some real exchange rate appreciation and problems in accommodating higher Government expenditure
without causing inflation or squeezing private sector credit growth. The report recommended that
allowance be made for the possibility o f moderate exchange rate appreciation, indicating that this i s not
likely to cause significant damage to export prospects, especially if it permits investments that address
infrastructure and other supply side bottlenecks.
Growth and Real Sector Performance

14.
Rwanda’s US$3.3 billion economy grew 5.5 percent in real terms in 2006 and an estimated
6 percent in 2007. On the supply side this good performance has been driven by the services and
industry sectors which grew at an average o f 7.8 percent and 8.6 percent annually, respectively. In
contrast, agriculture has performed poorly, growing only 1.1 percent in 2006 and contractingby almost 2
percent in 2007 driven by a 50 percent fall in coffee production due to effect o f poor rains on mature
coffee bushes. On the demand side, this rapid growth i s explained by expansion in private sector
consumption. Investment and trade have also grown rapidly but are much smaller shares o f GDP and thus
smaller drivers o f growth. A recent revision to the national accounts suggests that GDP grew 7.3 percent
and 7.9 percent in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The Bank i s reviewing the details o f this revision.

Rwanda has grown more strongly than the average economy in Africa in the last five years.
But there are important reasons for concern about recent growth performance. First, growth has
slowed considerably from the 10.8 percent average achieved in the immediate aftermath o f the genocide
(see Table 1). Second, with population growth o f about 2.7 percent annually, Rwanda i s facing a growth
deficit. The economy needs to grow at least 8 percent annually to make a significant dent on poverty.
Finally, the decline in agriculture, which employs 80 percent of Rwandans, also raises concern about the
poverty impact o f growth.

’Disbursements o f the external debt (excluding IMF) totaled about US$89 million, about US$26 million higher than projected. In
addition, in 2007, Rwanda received only about half o f the previously expected HIPC debt relief on debt service from creditors
that still provide relief on flow basis. The depreciation o f the U.S. dollar against other major currencies contributed to the
increase in the stock o f external debt at end-2007, and its net present value exceeded the indicative target under the program.
Other loans with lower levels o f concessionality e.g. recent loan to finance the Nyaborongo Hydro Power Project require a
waiver under the program with the IMF.

C. Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals
Overall Progress

16.
Rwanda is on track to achieve MDG 2 on universal primary education; MDG 3 on gender
equality; and MDG 6 on H N / A I D S and malaria. N e t primary enrollment i s currently 95 percent, with
97 percent enrollment o f girls (see Table 2). However, l o w completion rates and poor quality o f basic
education show that there are s t i l l major challenges to meeting MDG 2. The 2005 Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) estimates the HN prevalence rate at about 3 percent with female infection rates
(3.6 percent) substantially higher than those o f males (2.3 percent). These figures are not strictly
comparable to earlier ones, but there i s evidence that infection rates have declined, particularly in urban
areas. The number o f cases treated has increased dramatically and Rwanda i s one o f the very few
countries in Africa likely to reach universal treatment. Recognizing that regional challenges o f the
epidemic, including migration patterns might hamper this progress, the GoR i s complementing national
level efforts with participation in regional H I V / A I D S initiative^.^ Rwanda i s also on track to achieve the
targeted reduction in malaria incidence, the Abuja objective o f 60 percent coverage by bed nets and 60
percent prophylactic treatment o f women and children.

17.
I n contrast, the EDPRS acknowledges that MDG 1 on poverty and hunger, and MDGs 4
and 5 on child and maternal mortality respectively are unlikely to be achieved without a
considerably scaled-up effort. Between 2000/01 and 2005/06, poverty fell from 60.5 percent to 57
percent. A much faster reduction i s needed to reach the MDG target o f 30 percent. Poverty remains
pervasive in Rwanda (see Table 2). Malnutrition rates in children under five have been declining from
about 24 percent in 2000 t o 18 percent today, but faster progress i s needed. Infant mortality dropped from

Poverty and Inequality

18.
According to the 2005/2006 household survey, 56 percent of Rwandans live below the
national income poverty line. The average poor Rwandan’s consumption i s about RwF 150 a day
(about US$0.27), only 2 percent higher than in the 2000/1 household survey. Thirty seven percent o f
Rwandans live in extreme poverty and cannot afford the minimum food requirements o f 2,100 kcal a day.
The poverty gap, defined as the aggregate household income shortfall below the poverty line i s estimated
at 19 percent compared with 21 percent in 2000/01. Inequality i s high by international including African
standards. The Gini coefficient increased from 0.47 to 0.5 1 between the two household surveys.
19.
agricultural-phenomenon
with rural poverty at 67
Poverty i s largely a rural-and
percent. Poverty i s extremely high-91
percent-in
families whose main source o f income i s
agricultural wage labor. Poverty levels remain higher in families with smaller landholdings and in
female-headed households. Poverty also appears to be positively correlated with population density.
These factors suggest that reducing population growth, raising agricultural productivity and incomes, and
diversifying sources o f livelihood away from agriculture are key factors for reducing poverty. More
effort i s also needed to ensure that women participate fully in growth.
There i s significant regional disparity in poverty. Between 2000/01 and 2005/06, poverty f e l l
20.
strongest in the Eastern Province from 61.8 percent to 50.4 percent. In the Southern Province, which i s
now the poorest part o f the country, poverty increased from 65.8 percent to 67.3 percent. Only minor
progress was achieved in the Northern and Western provinces and the City o f Kigali. The reduction in
the east can be attributed to greater agricultural growth in that province, due to a combination o f factors:
(i)larger land holdings; (ii)
greater soil fertility; and (iii)greater use o f fertilizer.

21.
The modest decline in poverty coupled with population growth of about 2.7 percent means
the absolute number of poor people increased from 4.8 million to about 5.3 million between 2000/01
and 2005/06. With growth averaging 6.4 percent between the two household surveys, poverty elasticity
o f growth i s low-about -0.4 percent. The relatively small movement in the poverty headcount however
masks larger declines in the poverty gap. Further analysis o f the poverty data suggests that depending on
assumptions about changes in income distribution, per capita growth requirements to halve poverty by
2015 are in the range o f 3.5 to 5 percent annually. If population growth remains at current levels, this
would mean overall growth o f 6.2 percent to 7.7 percent annually.
22.
An estimated 52 percent of households are food insecure or vulnerable? Food insecurity
exists all over the country but tends to be concentrated in the Western and Southern provinces. It i s also
highest amongst female-headed households, agricultural laborers and those with “marginal livelihoods”
including those dependent on social transfers. The agricultural sector contributes significantly to national
food security, as more than 90 percent o f all food consumed i s domestically produced. Food grain prices
in Rwanda have risen over the last two years, although relative to many countries in sub Saharan Africa,
the rise has been somewhat muted due to a high level o f domestic production. This predominance o f
domestic production implies that productivity gains in agriculture have an enormous potential to protect
from further increases in food prices. Correspondingly, a fall in productivity poses a serious threat to
Rwanda‘s food security. This i s particularly true as the food import gap i s set to grow-at a time o f high
global food prices-if there i s no increase in agricultural productivity.

Child and Maternal Mortality

23.
Despite the tremendous progress Rwanda has made on maternal and child mortality, rates
are still amongst the highest in Africa. Infant and under-five mortality are only now at their 1992
levels. Further progress on maternal and child mortality rates depend on reforms across various sectors.
High mortality rates in children are linked to several factors including poor access to safe water, high
fertility, low birth-spacing, and low nutritional status. Accomplishing MDG 4 w i l l require health
education and both cultural and behavioral change, through strengthening o f community health programs,
and o f programs for nutrition, sanitation, and water. Major factors in Rwanda’s high maternal mortality
are poor geographical access to health facilities and cultural factors which result in limited use o f pre
natal services and a low level o f assisted deliveries. In the last five years the Government has introduced
several new policies in the health sector including increased financing, decentralization o f health services
delivery; implementation of performance based financing, scaling up o f mutuelles health insurance and o f
malaria control programs and improvements in human resources policies. These measures seem to be
yielding fruit in improving health outcomes.

III.RWANDA’S MAIN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
24.
The enormity of Rwanda’s development challenge is summarized in the assessment of M D G
achievability in Table 2 above. T o address this challenge, Rwanda needs to make progress in four
Human Capital and Skills; (iii)
Effectiveness o f the State;
critical areas: (i)Economic Transformation; (ii)
and (iv) Peace and Social Cohesion.
A. Transforming the Economy to Sustain Rapid and Inclusive Growth

25.
Rwanda appears to have fully exhausted the growth effects o f its post-conflict
reconstruction and growth has slowed. The underlying constraints to the economy’s competitiveness
need to be addressed, thus activating new drivers to sustain rapid and inclusive growth, raise incomes and
reduce income poverty. This requires transformation o f the economy in the following interrelated
access to and cost o f economic infrastructure; (iii)
private
dimensions: (i)productivity o f agriculture; (ii)
sector development including development o f skills and competencies o f the workforce; (iv)
diversification o f economic activities; and (v) integration into Eastern and Southern Africa.
Productivity o f Agriculture

26.
Agriculture accounts for 37 percent of GDP and has powerful backward and forward
linkages through related productive activities and through rising rural incomes. But productivity in
the sector i s low, with yields o f several key crops lagging behind other countries, even in sub-Saharan
Africa. Key constraining features include a binding land constraint which rules out extensification; poor
water management; small average land holdings (0.3 ha); low capacity from the district to the national
levels; and limited commercial orientation due to poor access to output and financial markets. All this
takes place in the context o f a potentially fertile, but challenging, physical environment. Steep terrains
and the highest population density in sub-Saharan Africa make good land husbandry a strict necessity and
an environmental prerogative.
27.
Rwanda’s growth challenges can, to a great degree, be met by improvements in agricultural
productivity. Recent analytical work’ indicates that improvements in sector productivity could deliver
growth o f about 6 percent annually through 2015, which could fuel average annual GDP growth at about
the same rate due to the presence o f important multiplier effects. Agriculture i s an important ‘engine o f
growth’ for Rwanda, not only because o f i t s large impact on GDP in the short and medium-run, but also

because o f i t s contribution to the transformation o f the economy in the long-run. With over 80 percent of
Rwandans working in agriculture, raising agricultural incomes i s critical for overall growth in output and
employment. Increased agricultural productivity raises rural incomes, stimulates demand for goods and
services in other sectors and allows resources to transfer from agriculture to other sectors. This i s critical
for Rwanda’s economic transformation process.
Access and Cost of Infrastructure

28.
Access to infrastructure i s limited and costs are prohibitive. In the energy sector, generation
capacity i s severely constrained at 55 MW and despite the high density of population, only 4.5 percent o f
households (90,000 customers) have access to electricity. Rwanda has in recent years (2004-2006),
suffered from acute electricity supply shortage and severe load shedding. The Government responded by
renting additional diesel generation capacity at high cost by increasing tariffs by over 100 percent to
about US$ 0.2UkWh. The current tariff levels, compared to US$ O.lO-O.l2/kWh in the rest o f the region,
and the poor quality o f supply severely limit the competitiveness o f Rwandan businesses. The supply
situation has improved in the last two years due to additional thermal generation and better than average
rainfall, but the country remains vulnerable to hydrological risk and supply disruptions as demonstrated
during the Kenya post-election violence early in 2008.
29.

The pace of power sector reform has increased since 2006 but there i s considerable distance
to go. New Electricity and Gas Laws, that clearly identify the role o f the private sector and the Rwanda
Utilities Regulatory Agency (RUM), have been submitted to parliament. The restructuring o f
Electrogaz, the electricity and water parastatal, and the strengthening o f the independent regulator aims to
position the sector for growth and increase domestic and foreign direct investment in power generation.

30.
Transport costs are as high as US$165/ton/km compared to average o f US$95/ton/km in the
region and represent about 40 percent o f import and export values. Rwanda is highly dependent on
road transport and i t s road network o f 14,000 km, spread over barely 27,000 square km o f national
territory, i s among the densest in sub-Saharan Africa. The mountainous terrain coupled with excessive
rain fall and severe erosion, i s particularly severe on the network, and significantly raises maintenance
cost which i s twice higher than that o f most sub-Saharan countries. Available datag indicate that 23
percent o f Rwanda’s asphalted network in 2005 was in good condition, while barely 5 percent and 2
percent o f the secondary and communal networks respectively were in good condition. As high as 85
percent o f the 1,100 km paved network requires heavy rehabilitation or periodic maintenance, and most o f
the secondary and communal roads have not been maintained for over a decade. Being a landlocked
country, Rwanda i s also dependent on its neighbors, especially Kenya and Tanzania, for access to
seaports and increased trade opportunities. The Government’s plan o f making Rwanda a trade and
services hub will require development o f strong transport links with Rwanda’s regional neighbors.
3 1.
I C T services in Rwanda are costly but improving. Teledensity remains low at approximately
7 percent, compared to the average for sub-Saharan Africa o f 19 percent” and subscribers are
concentrated in the urban areas. The primary reason for this poor sector performance, in addition to
limited energy resources, has been lack o f network coverage and the high price o f calls resulting from the
absence o f effective competition in the market, Government has recently taken some steps towards
rectifying this through: (i)adopting a licensing regime which allows the mobile operator to provide fixed
services and the fixed operator to provide mobile services; (ii)issuing a third license; and (iii)
commissioning a study to reconsider the sector market structure. These initiatives have led to
acceleration in network investment by both operators and a 35 percent reduction in MTN’s call charges.

The next major challenge will be to bring down further the cost o f I C T services, increase the availability
o f broadband and ensure that they are available throughout the country. Investment in infrastructure in
areas outside o f the major urban areas i s needed to provide these services. There has also been
considerable progress in using technology to improve government efficiency and effectiveness. In
addition to providing computing capabilities in district offices, government i s embarking on an ambitious
campaign for electronic service delivery.
Development of the Private Sector

32.
A modern private sector i s beginning to slowly emerge in Rwanda but i t s role in economic
activity i s s t i l l very limited. Private sector investment i s only 12 percent o f GDP compared to 14.4
percent in the region. FDI flows are on the rise but currently represent only 2 percent o f GDP compared
to 3.9 percent and 3.4 percent in Uganda and Tanzania respectively. The formal private manufacturing
sector remains small, fragmented, dominated by small f i r m s supplying to the local market. Only 14
percent o f firms in manufacturing engage in any exporting and o f those that do only 20 percent o f their
output i s exported. Furthermore the private sector in Rwanda i s still overwhelmingly informal. A recent
business operators’ census conducted by the Rwandan Private Sector Federation identified about 73,000
operators. Individual enterprises account for about 96 percent o f businesses; formally registered
businesses account for less than 1 percent and cooperatives close to 3 percent. Close to 90 percent o f
operations are micro enterprise employing between 1-4 staff. Less than 0.5 percent o f enterprises employ
more than 50 employees. Total employment by these enterprises i s about 198,000, only 13 percent o f
who have secondary or higher level education.
33.
I n addition to infrastructure, the emergence of a modern private sector in Rwanda i s
constrained by high regulatory cost burden, weak access to finance, and by a severe labor market
skills deficit. Progress has been made recently to improve the business environment and reduce the
regulatory cost burden Rwanda i s s t i l l ranked 150 out o f 178 countries in the 2008 Doing Business
report. The key areas o f poor performance include trading across borders (rank 166); protecting investors
(rank 165); access t o finance (rank 158); registering property (rank 137); and dealing with licenses(rank
124). The ongoing Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) confirms these as the factors that most
constrain businesses. In contrast the I C A finds that Rwanda compares very favorably to comparators in
the area o f governance when examined from the enterprise perspective.
Rwanda has the smallest
percentage o f f i r m s identifying corruption as a major constraint in a sample o f countries.” And Rwanda
has the second lowest percentage o f f i r m s (after South Africa) indicating that they expected to pay
informal payments t o public officials t o get things done or give gifts to secure Government contracts.I2
34.
While the performance o f the financial sector has improved considerably as a result o f
ongoing reforms, both the Doing Business Report and the ICA show that access to finance remains
a major issue. The sector has been opened up to private including foreign participation and the
regulatory framework i s being strengthened. Banks are now profitable after years o f significant losses.
Bank loans are also growing but remain insufficient to finance private investment needs. Credit to private
sector was only 11.7 percent o f GDP between 2000 and 2005 which i s low even by lower income country
or by African standards. Interest rates do not appear to be exorbitant, but f i r m s perceive the cost o f
finance to be an obstacle to business growth. These are symptomatic o f the limited depth o f the financial
system, low domestic savings rates, and lack o f adequate access to international financial markets. Small
and micro businesses face even more severe constraints to access finance, particularly for agricultural
activities. This in turn, is due t o a combination o f factors, including inappropriate loan products,
restrictive collateral requirements, perceptions o f high risk in lending to the rural clientele, and

insufficient legal, institutional and financial infrastructure in the field o f rural and agricultural finance.
35.
Rwanda faces a severe labor market skills deficit. In the 2006 manufacturing survey, 40
percent o f firms reported the lack o f skilled labor to be a major constraint for them. By comparison only
24 percent o f firms in Tanzania and 30 percent o f f i r m s in Uganda identified skills as a major or severe
constraint. The survey also showed that 44 percent o f industrial workers did not complete primary
education compared to 1 percent in Tanzania and 4 percent in Uganda. The severe shortage o f skilled
labor i s reflected in much higher than average wages for skilled personnel in Rwanda. Average monthly
wage o f a skilled production worker i s estimated at US$236 in Rwanda compared to US$59 in Burundi,
U S 6 7 in Uganda, US$71 in Tanzania, and US$119.56 in Kenya13 (see below).
Diversificationo f the Economy

36.
The structure of Rwanda's economy has been changing slowly since the late 1990s. During
2001-2006, services contributed 44 percent to GDP compared to 37 percent for agriculture. Industry
contributes about 14 percent. Tourism has grown rapidly since i t s re-launch in 2002. However, Rwanda
continues to rely on traditional subsistence agriculture and mineral c o m m o d i t i e ~ which
'~
are subject to
fierce international competition and price instability. There has been limited diversification into
manufactured goods and traded services, or into adding value to primary products. Tea and coffee
accounted for over half o f export revenues over the last five years. Rwanda also depends heavily on
imports, in particular fuel imports.
37.
This structure and limited diversification makes the economy vulnerable to domestic and
external shocks including climate change. Continued high dependence on traditional rain-fed
agriculture and the country's geography makes it highly vulnerable to climatic changes. In this context,
vulnerability to periodic natural disasters, mainly in the form o f droughts and floods i s a long t e r m
concern. It i s estimated that during 1974-2007, about 4 million Rwandans were affected by droughts and
2 million by floods. For a largely agrarian economy, the impact o f such natural disasters on economic
growth i s significant. Reducing dependence on rain-fed agriculture and addressing the twin issues o f
disaster risk management and climate change i s a key challenge. The limited diversification o f exports
and the narrow export base also leave the economy vulnerable to shocks in global prices o f primary
commodities and to external debt crises. After five years o f rapid export growth (averaging 12 percent
annually), exports constitute only 10 percent o f GDP). Heavy dependence on imports including fuel
imports and its location about 2,000 km from the coast make Rwanda hostage t o international o i l price
trends and to instability in coastal countries such as Kenya. The transformation agenda should create a
robust base o f economic activity that strengthens the resilience o f the economy.
Regional Integration

38.
Faster and more comprehensive regional integration can help Rwanda overcome some of its
economic constraints (landlocked location, limited natural resources and small size of its economy).
Indeed successful integration i s critical for realizing Rwanda's vision o f becoming a regional service and
trade hub as stated in the EDPRS. T o realize this vision, Rwanda needs t o speed up efforts to make the
business environment more attractive for regional investment and trade; lower domestic costs o f
production so domestic firms can compete on the regional market; and strengthen i t s participation in
regional infrastructure investment and services initiatives including efforts to strengthen the functioning
o f cross-border transit systems, power pools and regional skills development programs.

Fuller integration into Eastern and Southern Africa will facilitate the process of
transformation and vice-versa, as acknowledged by Rwanda’s EDPRS. Rwanda’s membership in the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and recent new membership in the Eastern
Africa Community (EAC) will help facilitate this process. Rwanda’s support for regional integration i s
fully in line with the World Bank’s new Africa Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS).I5
Participating in regional integration programs will also have the added benefit o f increasing Rwanda’s
access to IDA funds.I6
B. Developing Human Capital
Education and Skills

40.
While significant progress has been made in expanding access to primary education” with
the introduction of fee-free primary education in 2003, quality has suffered significantly with the
access shock. Several proxy indicators for quality at the primary level e.g. teacher-pupil ratio (about 1 to
74), completion and drop out rates and text-book pupil ratios are poor. A more refined understanding o f
learning achievement i s needed t o guide future interventions and the focus needs to shift from the number
o f teachers deployed t o their professional performance.

41.
Rwanda does not yet have the skills base required to realize its vision of a knowledge based
economy. Less than two-thirds o f the population completes some primary education, and only 3.5
percent and 0.4 percent complete secondary or higher education respectively. The GoR’s self evaluation
o f the PRSPl shows that about 170,000 young people start working life each year without sufficient
qualifications and therefore have only a limited chance to integrate successfully into economic activity.

42.

The absence of an integrated policy for post-basic education which offers students
knowledge and a range of skills to enable their successful participation in the labor market i s a key
factor in Rwanda’s skills deficit. Currently most post-basic education programs both general and
technical appear not t o be aligned t o labor market needs. A multipronged approach that balances access,
quality and relevance o f the different parts o f the post-basic education system is needed to develop the
skills required for strong private sector led growth in Rwanda.
Health, Nutrition and Population

43.
Rwanda faces similar health, nutrition and population challenges as other countries in
Africa notwithstanding its recent progress in expanding access to health services and controlling
malaria. One is t o reduce further the high rates o f preventable deaths and morbidity associated with
conditions like malaria, diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, parasitic infections, and
micronutrient deficiencies. Maternal and child malnutrition remains a significant challenge, with
vulnerability t o household food insecurity accentuated in the context o f rising food prices. Another
challenge i s to reduce physical, geographic, and financial barriers to accessing high-quality services. In
part, this entails: (i)building or renovating health facilities; (ii)raising the overall supply o f trained
health care providers; (iii)achieving a geographic distribution o f providers that i s more equitable; (iv)
enhancing performance-based financing mechanisms, reinforcing the autonomy o f health services, and
expanding the coverage o f affordable health insurance; (v) ensuring that the poorest households are
enabled t o participate in these arrangements; (vi) promoting good household health practices; and (vii)
improving nutrition.

I7 Significant improvements in equity were also achieved at the primary level including access by orphans, a particularly large
and disadvantagedgroup in Rwanda.

10

Population growth remains an important threat to poverty reduction. Rwanda has the
44.
highest population density in the region, presenting a challenge to economic growth as well as threatening
social cohesion. Even under an optimistic scenario, Rwanda’s population i s expected t o grow from
around 9.5 million in 2008 to 13.3 million by 2020, while density per square-km could increase from 350
to at least 500. There has been dramatic progress in the past few years in raising the use o f modem
contraceptives from 8 percent in 2005-06 to 27 percent in 2008, but further increases are needed to have
any significant impact on population growth.
Vulnerable Groups

45.
Rwanda’s genocide legacy includes large numbers o f vulnerable groups-widows, orphans,
disabled persons as well as people with psychological trauma and social strains. A strong system of
social protection i s needed to cater for these groups and ensure that they participate in growth. Given the
country’s pervasive poverty, there are at least three constraints that must be confronted in trying to design
social protection mechanisms: (i)fiscal constraint, given the limited scope for redistributive social
protection measures; (ii)administrative constraints, as the capacity to implement programs i s limited; and
(iii)information constraints that hinder differentiation o f extremely poor, marginally poor, and non-poor
households so that assistance can be targeted accordingly. Moreover, both geographic and inter-personal
distributions o f risks may be difficult to capture operationally to facilitate appropriate social protection
interventions. Because 80 percent o f employment and 37 percent o f GDP flow from small-scale
agriculture, weather-related and crop-price fluctuations dominate agricultural outcomes (incomes) and
hence living standards.
C. Building an Effective State

46.
Rebuilding the Rwandan state into one that i s more capable o f delivering public goods and
services, providing an enabling environment for growth and development and ensuring peace and security
i s one key component o f the country’s post-conflict reconstruction. There are at least three dimensions o f
this challenge: (i)the capacity o f state institutions; (ii)control o f corruption; and (iii)the voice and
capacity o f civil society to hold the state accountable.
State Institutions and Capacity

47.
Rwanda emerged from the civil war and genocide with a drastically reduced stock of
human capital and government institutions were similarly severely undermined or destroyed.
While economic growth rebounded quite quickly, the human and institutional damage i s taking much
longer to repair. Most ministries are s t i l l relatively young. As a result, a number o f systems, processes
and procedures have not been fully put in place and some core functions need to be better defined.
48.
I n addition, some of Rwanda’s civil service reforms could prove to be counterproductive.
The drastic reduction in public sector staffing has limited the number o f people available to supervise,
analyze and implement as well as to learn. A recent study” also suggests that the adoption o f uniform
organizational charts for i t s central ministries coupled with a grade structure that i s too flat seems to be
“uneconomic and inefficient”. While the Government has put in place a large number o f agencies as part
o f i t s outsourcing strategy, moving implementation away from central ministries, the relationship between
ministries and agencies remains undefined. This has generated overlapping mandates, weak supervision
and management o f agencies by their ministries. Similar problems exist with the rapid implementation o f
decentralization; ministerial staff are often not sufficiently aware o f the division o f labor between subnational levels and the center and how to effectively supervise activities at the sub-national level.

Impact o f Ongoing Public Sector Reforms, Final Report.

11

49.
Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment was
completed in 2007. It shows that while in some areas the public financial management system performs
strongly in several other areas considerable strengthening i s needed. Rwanda scored better than
comparable Southern and Western African countries and better than countries in the East African
Community on several aspects. Challenges are nevertheless considerable. The main areas o f difficulty
include accounting recording and reporting, and external scrutiny and audit. Reporting at decentralized
levels, i s particularly weak and a key area o f risk as increasing resources are decentralized to districts and
lower down. A fully functional integrated financial management system i s yet to be put in place.
Procurement reforms are considerably advanced: a sound legal framework has been put in place and the
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) created to regulate and oversee public procurement. A
comprehensive procurement training plan has been adopted and i s being implemented. But more
challenges remain to be addressed including adequately funding and staffing the RPPA to become fully
operational, training a critical mass o f public sector staff in procurement procedures, preparing
procurement manuals for contracting entities and widely disseminating the provisions of the procurement
law and regulations to the public. A Code o f Ethics for participants and provision for disclosure for those
in decision making positions i s also being prepared (Annex 9 provides a more detailed discussion of
fiduciary management).
Control of Corruption

50.
Rwanda i s widely recognized for low levels of corruption compared to the region and the
rest o f sub-Saharan A f r i ~ a . ’ Strong
~
political commitment to the fight against corruption i s evident in
vigorous prosecution of corruption cases and tough measures against proven cases. Within the past five
years, several government officials in leadership positions, a significant number of persons in the
judiciary and local government employees have been dismissed. The Ombudsman Office effectively
coordinates the annual exercise of assets declaration by public officials and other staff involved in the
management o f public funds. Together with the Ofice o f the Auditor General, they expose corrupt
behaviors and make recommendations for action by the Prosecutor General. Following the new
Constitution in 2003, the judicial sector was reformed to give independence to the Prosecution Office.
Consequently, this office with the help o f other institutions like the National Police i s able to
independently and systematically prosecute all cases of misappropriationof public funds. Rwanda’s good
standing i s also confirmed by its 2007 CPIA scores on dimensions such as Quality of Budgetary and
Financial Management (4.0), and Transparency, Accountability and Corruption in the Public Sector (3.5;
compared to the IDA Borrowers’ average o f 2.9).
Voice and Capacity of Civil Society

5 1.
The number o f civil society organizations (CSOs) in Rwanda has grown rapidly since 2000.
Currently, there are an estimated 37,688 CSOs in the country with close to 90 percent in the form o f
community based organizations. CSOs are distributed across the country fairly uniformly and form the
basis o f an emerging civil society. These organizations largely confine themselves to philanthropic work
and small income generating activities. Very few engage in any meaningful way in policy discourse or
engage in political debate. Progress i s needed on two fronts: (i)
to strengthen the environment for CSO
engagement with the state including access to information on government policies and programs; and (ii)
to strengthen the capacity o f CSOs to engage in policy formulation processes.
D. PromotingPeace and Social Cohesion
The challenge of building lasting social cohesion i s daunting given Rwanda’s history. A
52.
fundamental part of Government efforts in this regard i s to downplay ethnic differences and create one

12

Rwandan national identity.” It has also worked hard to complete the process o f dispensing justice in
genocide cases. Under the system o f traditional courts known as the Gacaca, about 1.2 million cases
have been tried, with the process expected to be concluded by the end o f 2008. Over 18,000 prisoners
have been released. While this system does not meet all the requirements o f a modem judicial system, it
enjoys the broad approval o f the population. In addition it would appear a sensiblekhe only option
available given the weak state o f the formal judicial system, the overcrowding o f the prisons and the
length o f time it would take to bring all cases to trial in the formal justice system.
53.
Traditional mechanisms such as the “umuganda”, the “ilorero”, the “ubunzf’21 etc. are
being used to help communities rebuild and create social capital. The program to reintegrate excombatants i s also proceeding well. There are nevertheless concerns about killings o f genocide survivors
by perpetrators who had been released and the persistencehesurgence o f what the Government has termed
“genocide ideology”. In addition, more needs to be done to address some o f the psychological and
psychosomatic effects o f the genocide. More time i s needed t o measure the success o f current efforts,
particularly since important changes in mindset are needed across the society. Political willingness to
critically examine the functioning o f these mechanisms in order to assess remaining challenges i s critical.
Government and civil society groups will need to partner closely on this.

54.
Rwanda’s long term development vision is articulated in the Rwanda Vision 2020
document. The vision sees Rwanda as a lower middle income economy (US$900 per capita) operating
as a knowledge-based service hub by 2020. It seeks t o achieve this in an equitable way and as a strong
and united nation. The vision i s built around six pillars: (i)good governance and a capable state; (ii)
human resource development and a knowledge-based economy; (iii)a private sector-led economy; (iv)
infrastructure development; (v) productive and market-oriented agriculture; and (vi) regional and
international economic integration. It also emphasizes the importance o f progress on four cross-cutting
issues: (i)gender equality; (ii)
natural resources; (iii)the environment; and (iv) science, technology and
ICT. The Vision 2020 objectives are fully in line with the MDGs but more ambitious.

55.
The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS), Rwanda’s second
generation PRSP, provides the medium-term framework for achieving the country’s long term
development aspirations. It articulates the country’s priorities for 2008-20 12. While the first PRSP
focused on managing a transitional period o f rehabilitation and reconstruction, the EDPRS focuses
strongly on growth. Among i t s key targets are: (i)growth o f about 8 percent annually; and (ii)reduction
in poverty to 46 percent. The strategy also makes the case for consolidating and extending the
decentralization o f public spending accompanied by robust accountability mechanisms at the
decentralized levels, and for regional and international economic integration. The EDPRS seeks
collaboration with Rwanda’s regional neighbors in the development o f economic infrastructure and highlevel skills in the services, health and education sectors. The EDPRS priorities are articulated through
three flagship programs: Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports; Vision 2020 Umurenge; and
Governance.
56.
Flagship one (growth) supports policy and investment interventions to: (i)develop skills and
capacity for productive employment; (ii) improve economic infrastructure especially transport,
Unlike in the pre-genocide period, reference i s no longer made to ethnic origin in individual identification documents and not
used as the basis for access to key social services.
21
Umuganda refers to residents o f neighborhoods coming together once a month for communal work to clean and beautify their
neighborhoods; ;ubunzi refers to traditional mediators; while the itorero refers to a traditional leadership training school.

13

power and communications; (iii) promote science, technology and innovation; and (iv) strengthen
the financial sector. The highest priority i s given to improving infrastructure. Another priority i s
transfer and adaptation o f technology t o local needs, especially in agriculture. This flagship i s expected to
raise productivity across all sectors o f the economy. I t s goal i s t o transform Rwanda’s economy from
subsistence agriculture towards an increase in commercial agriculture, as well as manufacturing and
services.

57.
Flagship two (Vision 2020 Umurenge) focuses on ensuring shared growth and on creation o f
opportunities for the poorest Rwandans. It has three components (public works, credit packages, and
direct supports) that involve four complementary elements: (i)agricultural productivity improvement for
households with land; (ii)
publicly funded, socially productive, labor-intensive employment for landless
Rwandans without j o b opportunities; (iii)
social assistance for landless people incapable o f work; and (iv)
improved access to credit for input purchases or micro-enterprise development by members o f households
assisted through elements

(ixiii).

58.
Flagship three (Governance) seeks to strengthen political governance, economic
governance, and build institutions and capacity o f the state. Emphasis i s given t o maintaining peace
and security, promoting peace and reconciliation amongst Rwandans, reforming the justice system to
uphold human rights and the rule o f law, and empowering citizens to participate in their o w n social,
political and economic development. It envisages a wide range o f reforms to strengthen public sector
institutions and capacity including further decentralization, enhancing accountability at all levels o f
government, strengthening public financial management and increasing the predictability and
transparency o f policy-making. The other elements o f the flagship i s improvement in the “ soft
infrastructure” needed t o create an attractive business environment specific elements o f which are
strengthening commercial justice systems, business and land registration reforms, regulatory frameworks
and business licensing and promoting principles o f good corporate governance.

59.
I n addition to these three flagships, the EDPRS also seeks to consolidate gains achieved
under the PRSP I in health, water and basic education. In health the objectives are to maximize
preventive health measures and build capacity to extend quality basic health services to the majority o f
Rwandans. In parallel, the EDPRS envisages a significant drop in population growth through increased
access to and use o f family planning methods. The EDPRS aims to ensure sustainable and integrated
water resources management and development for multipurpose use including increased access to safe
water and sanitation services. Having achieved significant growth in enrollment, the focus i s now turned
to improving quality o f nine year basic education and t o raising completion rates.
B. Economic Outlook over the CAS Period
60.
The external environment has become less favorable, posing increasing challenges for most
economies in Africa including Rwanda. The global economy i s slowing down, commodity prices have
generally risen with o i l prices reaching record-high levels, and global financial markets are unsettled.
However, if Rwanda i s able to strongly implement its proposed reform and investment program
articulated in the EDPRS, the adverse effects o f the external environment on growth and other
macroeconomic balances could be mitigated.

61.
Other factors will help mitigate adverse growth effects. From a broader perspective, the
gradual broadening o f the commodity price boom from o i l t o metals has helped Rwanda offset the
adverse effects o f higher o i l prices through higher prices on i t s net commodity exports. In the last few
years, minerals, metals and chemicals have become predominant in Rwanda’s export mix. These
favorable non-oil commodity related terms o f trade have contributed to growth in export revenues. In
addition, like most African countries with nascent financial markets, Rwanda has so far shown and i s

14

expected to continue showing limited reaction to continuing turbulence in global financial markets.
Therefore, the risk o f a reversal o f portfolio flows, which would reduce external financing and hurt
growth in countries that are heavily reliant on financial markets, i s insignificant in Rwanda.
Rwanda’s economic outlook over the CAS period can therefore be expected to remain
62.
favourable if GoR implements successfully the medium-term policy agenda as outlined in the
EDPRS. This would counter the apparent downward trend in growth, raising annual growth from the
average o f 4.8 percent during 2003-07 to about 6 percent over the period 2009-11. This assumes the
slow-down in the global economy persists, and i s therefore a lower bound estimated projection o f growth.
Preliminary data for first half o f 2008 show that growth across services and industry has remained
buoyant. Agriculture i s also experiencing a recovery due to recent successful intensification efforts.

63.
Assuming an incremental capital output ratio of around 4, based on historical trends, the
projected annual GDP growth o f 6 percent would be achieved through increased public and private
sector investment, including measures to modernize agriculture and address infrastructure
bottlenecks. Reflecting the strong emphasis that GoR i s placing on public infrastructure investment,
overall investment rates are projected to rise fairly steadily from about 20 percent o f GDP in 2006, to
about 24 percent o f GDP by the end o f the CAS period (see Table 3). Public investment will increase
from 9.8 percent in 2008 to close to 11 percent o f GDP by the end o f the CAS period With the private
sector’s engagement in the social sectors and also in infrastructure expected t o be strengthened, private
investment would also trend upward gradually beginning 2008, to about 13.4 percent o f GDP per year, in
the medium-term. The higher investment levels would also be complemented by other less capital
intensive investment to operationalize the recently completed skills, science and technology strategy.

Higher rates o f GDP growth as projected (in the range o f 6 percent):’ would in turn, allow
for a strong recovery in private consumption, raising per capita consumption to about US$435 by
2011, up from U S 3 2 0 in 2007. The strong growth performance would also have significant impact on
employment prospects. The greatest gains for Rwandans would likely come from the strong growth in

construction and the service sector coupled with increased public spending o n infrastructure projects,
including on rehabilitation and maintenance.
I n line with the need for increased investment to accelerate and sustain growth, government
65.
capital spending would increase strongly over the medium term, causing the overall fiscal balance
to remain in deficit. The deficit (including grants) would widen t o about 4 percent o f GDP by 2011, up
sharply from under 1.5 percent in 2007. Part o f this increase would be due t o higher investment, but the
projections also reflect the possibility o f continued high world price level o f imports t o Rwanda.

Growth i s expected from agriculture stemming from increased use o f inputs, including fertilizer, industry, including
construction and service sectors with links to the constructionphase o f projects, includingtransportation.

22

15

66.
The external current account deficit would also widen considerably from about 5 percent of
GDP (including grants) in 2007, to about 12 percent of GDP (including grants) by 2011. Strong
import growth stemming from higher capital imports associated with the expanding public investment
program, i s expected to outpace moderate expansion in exports, led by receipts from traditional exports
(particularly coffee), and tourism, keeping the current account in deficit. Successful implementation o f
the export promotion strategy, coupled with investments and policy reforms to reduce the cost o f doing
business should over time promote increased exports, opportunities for economically efficient import
substituting activities and foreign direct investment. This will be critical for stemming the widening
current account deficit. Foreign exchange reserve accumulation would continue, albeit more slowly than
in recent years. External financing requirements would amount to about US$3 billion over 2008-201 1,
and expected to be fully financed largely from grants, concessional loans, and private capital inflows,
including foreign direct investment.

67.
Consistent with the medium-term policy objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability,
the BNR i s expected to contain inflationary pressures arising from fiscal expansion and scaled-up external
assistance. Inflation i s estimated to reach around 10 percent at the end o f the year.23 However, with
strong implementation o f monetary policy, this could decline from the current level to about 8 percent per
annum during 2009-12.

These estimates reflect the recent trends in inflation and are therefore higher than the estimates in the fourth
review of the PRGF which was approved by the IMF Executive Directors in June 2008. The upcoming PRGF
review mission will re-examine the inflation projections.

V. WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Lessons from Implementingthe Last CAS

68.
The recent CAS Completion Report (CASCR) concluded that performance under the last
CAS was satisfactory. Rwanda made substantial progress in the area o f structural reform particularly in
public finance management, the financial sector, business environment, and ICT. The Bank’s support to
basic services in health, education, HIV/AIDS, water and sanitation has delivered considerable results on
the ground. In addition the Bank’s assistance in the community driven development program to build
capacity at the local level has been impressive. However, progress has been slow in: (i)improving
agriculture productivity and growth; (ii) restructuring key state enterprise in tea, telecom and energy
sectors; and (iii)
building institutional capacity in the public sector. Furthermore, improving capacity and
services in urban infrastructure has been slower than anticipated. The Bank strategy will incorporate the
following key lessons learned from the implementation o f the previous CAS and ISN:
e

The introduction of budget support operations under the PRSG series provided an important forum
for policy dialogue and significantly improved donor harmonization and strengthened cross
sectoral linkages. The Bank needs to work closely with other donors in fostering harmonization and
alignment agenda. Comparative advantage and selectivity need to be key criteria in the future
strategy where the Bank can provide leadership during the implementationo f EDPRS.

e

Future programs need to be appropriately designed to reflect local capacity constraints and be
more results-focused Support should be provided to design and sequence reforms in line with
capacity constraints to achieve the best outcomes. The CAS objectives and outcomes should focus on
results that are achievable during the CAS period given the capacity constraint and IDA resource
envelope.

e

Thefuture program should have a strong results framework. The absence of a results-based CAS
framework at the project design level limited the reliability o f the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)
system.

B. The Current World Bank Group Program

69.
The I D A portfolio in Rwanda consists o f 11 active projects and the PRSG (general budget
support) operation with a total (gross) commitment o f about US$363 million. Approximately
US$115 million remains to be disbursed. Annex 20 provides an overview o f the current portfolio. In
addition to the annual PRSG, there are major investment lending operations in agriculture, capacity
building, HIV/AIDS, urban development,, electricity and transport. Rwanda i s also participating in three
regional projects.24Since FY04, much o f the support has been provided to social sectors and for public
administration, accounting for about 40 percent and 35 percent o f new commitments (excluding budget
support), respectively. In the last few years, the portfolio has performed well and delivered strong results
in areas such as general budget support, rural water and HIV/AIDs. There are no problem projects.
The International Finance Corporation’s (WC) ongoing operations in Rwanda focus on: (i)
improving the investment climate; (ii)building the capacity of S M E s as well as micro enterprises; and
(iii)proactively supporting development o f projects with high impact in the financial, tourism,
agribusiness, and infrastructure sectors. The ongoing investment program includes: (i)expansion of
Intraspeed SA Rwanda Ltd (ISARL), a freight and forwarding company operating in the Great Lakes
Region o f Eastern Africa; (ii)
post- privatization financing o f two leading hotels privatized by GoR; (iii)
processing o f a risk-sharing facility with the Banque Rwandaise de De‘veloppement (BRD) to finance

70.

The include the HIV/AIDS Great Lakes Initiative; the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation; and the Africa
Trade Facilitation Project.

private schools in Rwanda; (iv) trade finance facility to the Bunque Commerciule du Rwanda (BCR) BCR
and exploring providing AMSME to local banks; (v) IFC has commenced work on a housing finance and
technical assistance program in collaboration with GoR; (vii) IFC trust funds have supported the pilot
plant o f Lake Kivu methane gas now close to operational; and (viii) IFC recently approved up to US$4
million to invest in the development o f a gas methane power project in Rwanda.

7 1.
I F C has been providing advice on privatization and entrepreneurship initiatives including
advising GoR on the privatization of Rwanda Air. IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa (PEPAfrica) i s currently implementing two technical assistance programs, the Rwanda Leasing Program ( U P )
and the Rwanda Entrepreneurship Development Program (REDP), both designed to support SMEs.
REDP will enhance entrepreneurship, support the growth and competitiveness of the S M E Sector and
improve the business environment. The program design and funding arrangements have been finalized.
IFC has just completed a Gender Entrepreneurship Markets study.
72.
M I G A i s increasingly engaging in Rwanda. I t s first guarantee, signed in April 2008, secured
an investment in the microfinance sector, further to recent increase in the minimum capital requirements.
MIGA i s currently underwriting two further investments in the financial sector that are likely to be signed
in the second quarter o f FY 09. These investments reflect an increased willingness by foreign investors to
engage in Rwanda with the support of a World Bank Group guarantee.
C. The Program o f Support FYO9-12

73.
The CAS seeks primarily to contribute to the EDPRS objective of significantly raising
growth and creating jobs. A secondary objective i s to consolidate specific elements o f Rwanda’s recent
social progress by tackling selected aspects o f social vulnerability. The strategy seeks to use the World
Bank Group (WBG) resources more selectively for greater impact and respects Government preferences
for WBG support in strategic growth sectors. The CAS i s also about new ways of working that will
enhance the effectiveness o f WBG assistance.
74.

The CAS is framed around two strategic themes and five CAS outcomes (see Table 5):
CAS strategic theme one: Promote economic transformation and growth. The primary objective
o f the CAS i s to help Rwanda make progress on activating new drivers o f growth that can be
sustained over time. The substantial part o f the financial envelope over the period will therefore
support the EDPRS Flagship on Growth and focus on four key outcomes: (i)agricultural production;
(ii)
access and quality of infrastructure services; (iii)
private sector development; and (iv) capacity to
manage public resources.
CAS strategic theme two: Reduce social vulnerability. A secondary objective i s to ensure that the
most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress in
building a more stable society. A smaller program will support the Flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge
initiative; help Rwanda get on track on child and maternal mortality goals; and promote peace and
social cohesion through demobilization and reintegration.

75.
Given Rwanda’s capacity challenge, the new program will seek to mainstream assistance to
capacity across all interventions. This will be done through applying a Capacity Building Filter (see
paras 117-119 and Annex 4).

76.

Alignment with the EDPRS. The CAS supports implementation o f Rwanda’s four year
medium-term development framework. The results framework i s directly aligned with development
outcomes derived from the EDPRS. The support program has been discussed with government, donors,
private sector, and civil society during CAS consultations in February, April and June 2008.

77.
Selectivity for greater impact. The CAS focuses Bank engagement on targeted EDPRS areas,
primarily growth and selected social areas. I t supports mainly progress on MDGs 1 on poverty and
hunger; as well as MDG 4 on child mortality; and MDG 5 on maternal mortality. This selectivity i s based
on GoR’s preferences for Rwanda’s engagement with the Bank. The GoR exercises a strong lead in
donor coordination and has begun to work with donors on a clearer division o f labour by identifying areas
o f individual donor comparative advantage. In this context GoR has requested the Bank to give priority
to the areas targeted under the CAS. This focus i s also justified since these goals pose the greatest
challenge for Rwanda and are areas in which limited WBG resources can add most value.
78.
The new program will significantly reduce areas where the WBG provides financial support
to Rwanda. Specific areas where no new IDA financing i s envisaged include: (i)primary education; (ii)
water and sanitation; (iii) HIV/AlDS; (iv) urban management/development; and (v) public service reform.
In primary education, the Government intends to make greater use o f the Education for all Fast Track
Initiative (EFA FTI) as well as additional support from bilateral donors including new entrants into the
sector (e.g. Canada). Similarly the support to HIV/AIDS will continue largely through the Global Fund to
fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria as well as through the United States President’s Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The AfDB will continue to lead donor support for water and sanitation and the
move towards a SWAP could help catalyze additional donor resources. Anticipated support from the
Chinese Government for road investments in Kigali and Belgian support to general urban management
issues in Kigali will carry forward some elements o f the urban development agenda while some of the
policy reform elements will be taken on in the PRSG series. As regards public service reforms, the World
Bank and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DflD) are working with
Government to prioritize the implementationof critical system wide reforms which will create conditions
for further public service capacity strengthening through the Capacity Building Filter.
79.

Financial support i s also more targeted within the areas of intervention. For example
support to social protection i s targeted to public works and direct assistance and the health program
focuses on community health targeting child and maternal health risks. This shift in the strategy will
become more evident as several ongoing operations come to an end. Annex 2 explains in more detail the
enhanced selectivity in the new program and Annexes 6 and 7 provide more details on Rwanda’s aid

19

environment and a mapping of donor areas o f responsibility.
80.
Alongside selectivity in our financial assistance, the strategy recognizes the Bank’s
considerable comparative advantage in analytical and advisory activities and aims at providing
enough flexibility to respond to Government demand for such support even in areas where the
the institution
Bank may not be providing financial assistance. This primarily includes areas where: (i)
as a whole has considerable experience; (ii)no other donors are providing such support; and (iii) our
support would lead to clear policy and/or implementationoutcomes. A key example i s in basic education
where although new IDA financing i s not envisaged, the Bank will continue to be the administrator o f the
EFA FTI Catalytic Fund grant and will remain engaged in policy dialogue with government on basic
education objectives. In this regard, the Bank will provide key analytical inputs for the continuing
evolution of the government’s basic education strategy as well as the evaluation o f the impact of different
teacher recruitment and incentive polices.

81.
Donor Harmonization. The CAS actively seeks synergies with other donors and strives for
increased donor harmonization. A mapping o f donors’ activities in various sectors i s provided (Annex 6).
I D A Resources

82.
I D A availability. The CAS covers the period FYOPFY12, which includes the IDA15
replenishment period (FY09-11) and the first year o f IDA16. The indicative resource envelope for
Rwanda under I D A 15 i s larger on a per annum basis than resources available for similar performance
during IDA14, due mainly to the larger size o f the IDA15 envelope.25 The indicative total resource
allocation during IDA15 i s SDR255.9 million (US$417 million
comprising a firm
allocation o f SDR81.8 million for FY09 and an indicative amount o f SDR174 million during FY10F Y I 1. The indicative amount for FY12 i s SDR88.2 million (US$144 million), but the actual amount will
depend on available resources during IDA16. Therefore for the entire CAS period (FY09-FY12) the
indicative IDA allocation totals SDR344 million (US$561 million equivalent). Actual allocations during
the CAS period will be determined on an annual basis and will depend on: (i)total IDA resources
available; (ii)Rwanda’s performance rating relative to that o f other IDA borrowers; (iii)financing terms
(credits or grants); and (iv) number of IDA-eligible countries.

83.
The Government has expressed an interest in being reclassified from a red light to a yellow
light country to enable access to greater I D A allocations as well to other sources of concessional
financing.*’ The most recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (see Annex 5) suggests that Rwanda i s s t i l l at
a high risk o f debt distress, which does not support a change in Rwanda’s debt sustainability classification
at this time. However, for selected high return investments, borrowing on concessional terms including
terms less favorable than in the program with the IMF could s t i l l be consistent with external debt
sustainability. This has recently been demonstrated for the Nyabarongo Hydropower project which i s
partly financed through a concessional loan o f U S $ 97.7 million (40 percent concessionality compared to
50 percent required in the program with the IMF)28.The project should improve Rwanda’s external
position, by reducing dependence on thermal energy generated from expensive imported fossil fuel.

” Estimates for

IDA15 (and first year o f IDA16) are based on Rwanda’s performance in FY08, per capita income, population
and the size o f the IDA15 replenishment.
26 Based on an exchange rate o f SDR=US$I .63 on July 3 1,2008. The actual dollar amounts will depend on the exchange rate at
the time o f commitments.
” Concessional financing from sources such as Japan require Rwanda to be classified as eligible for a mixture of grants and
concessional IDA credits.

CAS Instruments

84.
I n line with Rwanda’s aid policy and the country’s good performance, the Bank will further
increase the use of development policy lending (DPL). The ongoing annual PRSG (budget support)
will remain the main DPL instrument. The Government i s strongly committed to the EDPRS reform
program that underpins the PRSG and the budget i s well aligned with the EDPRS. What i s needed to
ensure full success i s strengthened capacity to design reforms and programs, to implement them
effectively, to monitor their impact and feed results into further policy and program refinements. Greater
attention will be given to building this capacity. In addition to implementation of the Capacity Building
filter, the ongoing Public Sector Capacity Building Project and the Decentralization and Community
Development Project will support capacity needs at central and decentralized levels respectively. The
program will also continue to use the Japanese funded PHRD facility to finance some of the capacity
needed for PRSG implementation. The Bank will continue to use the opportunity provided by the regular
Joint Budget Reviews between Government and budget support donors to ensure that the budget remains
strongly aligned to the EDPRS objectives. Investment lending will be used less than in the past and
primarily for delivering large infrastructure including regional programs in addition to areas
where IDA financing will help to leverage additional resources.

Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and Technical Assistance (TA) services will be
used more strategically to complement financial operations. In particular these pieces will seek to
respond more to demand and provide real time advice and support to Government. The CAS will seek
balance between this demand driven approach and the need to also be strategic and selective in the

21

broader AAA and TA services to be effective.

New Ways o f Doing Business

86.
The CAS incorporates new ways of doing business that should enhance WBG effectiveness
and impact. The first i s to increase use of country systems. This should strengthen Rwandan
ownership o f our support as well as help build capacity within Government to manage development
programs. Strong emphasis will therefore be placed on working with Government to create the conditions
for greater use o f country systems through ongoing support to procurement and P F M reforms while also
recognizing the importance o f early pilots to create initial success and draw lessons to guide scaling up.
A key element o f the strategy will be to commence the initial assessments o f the country systems in
procurement as defined and explained in the Board approved paper on the Use of Country Procurement
Systems in Bank-Supported Operations: Proposed Piloting Program with a view to implementing the
proposed Rwanda pilot on use o f national systems for procurement in a selected project. Work i s also
ongoing to strengthen the capacity o f the Auditor General’s Office to gradually take over the external
audit function on all Bank financed operations.
87.
Given the Government’s preference for budget support, the CAS will accommodate
increasing use o f our T A and M A services to help Government design and refine specific Rwandan
programs and initiatives that could be funded through the national budget rather than for the preparation
o f specific stand alone Bank financed operations. This new way o f working will mean that AAA and TA
services may not necessarily support stand alone Bank funded operation.
88.
The CAS will use Trust Fund resources more aggressively to strengthen partnerships and
complement I D A resources for impact. In addition to existing Trust Funds, new Funds that will be
tapped include the Norwegian Health Results Innovation Facility; Statistics for Results Initiative; the
Joint Governance Partnership Facility between the World Bank, DfID, and the Netherlands and the
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). These new facilities will contribute to
funding o f operations as well as to AAA and TA programs.
89.
The CAS will reduce proliferation of activities and seek appropriate consolidation of tasks
to allow better funding of individual operations both at preparation and supervision stages. This
w i l l require continued effort to work effectively across sectoral silos and recognition o f individual
contributions to team tasks.

Strategic Theme One: Promoting Rwanda’s Economic Transformation for Sustained Growth

90.
Under the first strategic theme, the CAS will focus on the following four EDPRS outcome areas:
(i)raising agricultural production in a sustainable way; (ii)improving access t o and quality of key
economic infrastructure services; (iii)
improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv)
strengthening government capacity at central and local level t o manage public resources. Synergies
within the WBG, with other donors, ongoing and new IDA lending and regional projects will be key to
achieving these outcome areas. All o f these outcome areas are closely interrelated and mutually
reinforcing. The program i s designed and will be implemented t o take advantage o f these synergies.
CAS Outcome 1.I: Agricultural production -particularly of food crops-sustainably raised9

9 1.
Support for raising agricultural production will target investments in a few focused and
complementary areas. Given Rwanda’s context, emphasis will be put on sustainable approaches. The
Second Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP 2 ) which was approved at the end o f FY08 i s a key
instrument for addressing this agenda. This four-year second phase A P L will continue directly from the
first phase focusing on irrigation and sustainable land management (SLM). It will expand irrigated area in
cultivated marshlands and increase the use o f S L M practices on associated hillsides to accelerate the pace
o f agricultural intensification. Further support to the sustainable land management agenda will be
provided through the proposed Land Management, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH)
Project which has been designed by GoR. The LWH i s a comprehensive land-husbandry, waterharvesting and hillside-irrigation initiative for commercialized and professional agriculture. The Bank i s
providing technical assistance to help refine certain elements o f the project design, helping Government
address safeguard issues, and helping to leverage other donor resources through i t s own financing. The
ongoing Integrated Management o f Critical Ecosystems project will promote the sustainable use and
management o f Rwanda’s critical ecosystems, particularly marshlands. The proposed Lake Victoria
Basin Environmental Management project (FY 10) will bring a regional dimension to the S L M agenda.
The Bank will take advantage o f the multi-partner platform provided by TerrAfrica to carry out analytical
work to support GoR in developing a programmatic investment framework for SLM. Finally, Rwanda
will participate in several multi-donor trust funds providing technical assistance to regional initiatives in
agriculture research?’

92.
F o r greater impact, the support to agricultural production will be complemented by
interventions to promote increasing commercialization of agriculture. The ongoing RSSP2 already
focuses on improving the marketing and intensification capacity o f producer groups. The planned LWH
project (FY 10) emphasizes horticultural development that uses commercial-value fruit species. It will
build farmer capacity and establish model organized farming communities who .can function as effective
and efficient market actors. Access to agricultural and rural finance will be expanded through the design
and implementation o f innovative savings and loans products that enable rural actors t o avail themselves
of productivity-enhancing technologies, and emerging value-chain opportunities, and through reform of
the Agriculture Guarantee Fund. This program which will be supported through either the PRSG series or
as part of the LWH operation. It will benefit from collaboration with the IFC’s (urban-oriented) leasing
program and leverage donor partner diagnostic activities on rural finance particularly that o f the countrywide DflD-sponsored FinScope financial access survey. The planned Rural Roads project (FY 10) will
promote commercialization o f agriculture by increasing access to markets and improving the delivery o f
Responding to the challenges in agriculture in Rwanda, the interventions in this area will strengthen agricultural productivity.
However given the challenges associated with accurately measuring productivity, the outcome and i s framed in terms of
agricultural production.

Research in Africa (FARA) and the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central M i c a
(ASARECA).

extension services. Similarly the Energy Access Roll-Out Program (FY09; see below) will target key
agricultural regions that are currently o f f the national grid and therefore provide opportunities for adding
value to agricultural produce. Depending on progress in implementation o f these operations, additional
resources will be provided for the agriculture sector in FY12. The Bank administered N i l e Basin Trust
Fund will finance a Regional Agricultural Trade and Productivity Project to provide technical assistance
for capacity building in boosting regional agricultural export trade.
I n the context o f the current global food price crisis the Bank will step up i t s support for
93.
the Government’s food price response program. It has accessed financing from the Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP) t o support the purchase and distribution o f improved inputs for food crops,
particularly fertilizer, a critical part o f the Government’s intensification strategy. The Bank has worked
closely with the International Fertilizer Development Centre (IFDC) to provide technical assistance to
Government to design a fertilizer distribution system that builds capacity o f private sector to participate
more actively in this sector. This will contribute t o the sustainability o f input provision beyond the crisis.
As lead donor in agriculture and co-chair o f the Rural Sector Cluster, the World Bank has
94.
an increasingly important role in the area o f technical assistance and policy advice. The Bank i s
currently the Government’s first port o f call for technical review and assistance on a much broader range
o f issues impacting the sector, from rural finance t o supporting the development o f a SWAP with other
donors.31 The decentralization o f a sector specialist to the Country Office has reinforced our ability to
provide technical assistance, which i s being explicitly recognized as a product line over the CAS period.

CAS Outcome 1.2: Improved access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services
95.
The CAS will step-up support to improving access to and quality of economic
infrastructure. This i s one area where the WBG needs to and can indeed explore and harness greater
synergies. Stronger collaboration will also help provide a basis for stronger private sector investment in
the infrastructure sectors.
96.
I n energy an important focus will be put on assisting the Government to develop electricity
generation based on domestic methane gas from Lake Kivu. This resource offers the potential to
replace the existing thermal generation based on imported petroleum products with l o w cost bulk power
supply based on domestic gas. I F C i s in discussions with Government on possible participation in two
consortia with private sector partners to build Methane Gas Power plants in sizes up t o 100 MW. IDA i s
preparing a partial risk guarantee to hedge the off-taker risk and thus facilitate private sector participation.
In addition, IDA i s providing technical assistance through the ongoing Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation
(UER) project to support the Government in trying to ensure a fair and equitable deal for Rwandan
electricity consumers. The proposed Rusumo Falls Hydropower regional project will complement the
methane gas-based generation and assist in developing additional regional hydro capacity. In addition,
the UER project will be expanded through a GEF grant in early FY09 to remove market barriers to energy
efficiency and renewable energy development.

IDA will also provide financing for rehabilitating and expanding Rwanda’s national
97.
transmission and distribution networks. The Electricity Access Roll-Out project (FY09) will underpin
the national access program and ensure that the increased power generation capacity (total estimated at
about 155 MW from 55 MW by 2012) will be efficiently delivered to the consumer. In the EDPRS, the
GoR has targeted a tripling o f access by 20 12 to about 15 percent o f households and at least 50 percent o f
identified public institutions in health, education and local administration. This will also include rural
consumers and those consumers who may be o f f the national grid. IDA’S investments in generation and

’’AfDB, Belgium, EU, IFAD, Japan, Netherlands, UK-DFID, USAID.
24

transmission strengthening will be closely coordinated with the ’ AfDB regional program to expand
regional transmission links which could allow Rwanda to export possible surplus power to neighboring
countries and integrate in a future East African Power Pool. MIGA would, in principle, be willing to
consider offering guarantees to eligible energy generation projects during the CAS period, and in
particular projects supported in the private sector by IPPs (independent power producers). Depending on
implementation progress and availability o f IDA resources, additional financing will be made available
for the sector in FY 12.

98.
As the lead donor in energy and the co-chair of the energy sector cluster, the Bank will
continue to support major reforms through ongoing policy dialogue and technical assistance. IDA
will continue to support reform of the energy sector through the policy dialogue under both the PRSG
series and investment lending operations. This agenda includes further strengthening o f technical and
financial efficiency o f the power utility, Electrogaz, as well as capacity strengthening o f the newly created
utility regulator, RURA. One focus o f the dialogue will be on making progress on an energy sector
SWApfocused on access expansion-which i s expected to be in place before the end of calendar year
2008. As part o f the access program, IDA i s facilitating twining between Electrogaz and the Tunisian
Utility STEG to enable Rwanda to benefit from the Tunisian experience in planning and executing a
national access program.
99.
I n transport, the focus will be on effective implementation o f the ongoing Transport Sector
Development Project (TSDP) and ongoing and planned regional projects. The TSDP which i s cofunded by an IDA grant, an Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) grant and the GoR through its Road
Maintenance Fund, contributes to improving the quality o f key international and domestic road corridors
as part o f a wider strategy to improve regional connectivity. Additional resources will be required over
the CAS period to fund cost increases on the project from inflationary effects of recent events in Kenya
and also from some changes in the road design. The ongoing urban infrastructure and city management
aims to increase access to priority urban infrastructure in Kigali and two secondary cities (Ruhengeri and
Butare). Ongoing regional projects include the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation project.
Rwanda will also participate in the East Africa Road Network project (FYlO), which will link road
networks in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia and potentially Southern Sudan.
Financing for rural roads will complement support to improved productivity in agriculture and rural
development (see above). These investments will be implemented using approaches that create
employment, particularly for unemployed youth.

100. The Bank will work with other donors in the sector such as the EU and the AfDB and
within the WBG to explore synergies. IDA and IFC will work jointly and closely with the AfDB and
other Governments in the region to explore the feasibility o f a regional railways project that will link
Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda. Achievement of this railway will facilitate Rwanda’s integration in the
region, reduce its transport costs significantly and be an important building block in its efforts to become
a regional trade and services hub. MIGA i s willing to consider supporting such regional integration
projects that would either benefit from a more regional approach (e.g. COMESA) and/or through direct
private investments in a specific section o f the rail link.

101. Support to the I C T sector will focus on strengthening the enabling environment, and
improving both domestic and international connectivity to lower the barrier for investment by
operators to extend broadband access geographic coverage. This support will be provided primarily
through the ongoing E-Rwanda Project for eGovernment applications and services and through Rwanda’s
participation in the second phase o f the Regional ICT Project (RCIP) planned for early FY09. IDA’S
support will complement the US$40 million investment being pledged by the Government for the ICT
sector as well as the current efforts led by RURA under the Universal Service Fund initiative.

25

CAS Outcome 1.3: Improved environmentfor private sector development

102. Support to improve the environment for private sector development will target skills
including entrepreneurial skills, the business regulatory environment, and the financial sector.
IDA, IFC (including FIAS) and MIGA will seek additional opportunities to further strengthen our
ongoing joint work in these areas.

103. A highlight of the program will be an initiative to promote entrepreneurial skills while
promoting investments through catalytic interventions. The driving premise i s that the private sector
engages in entrepreneurship when the project development risks are clearer, which leads to the design o f
more robust risk mitigation, and in turn to enhanced investment in commercial ventures. Correlatively,
the set-up o f an IDA-funded Project Development Fund (PDF) will help identify credible investment
opportunities grounded on prospects of products and market development. The PDF will catalyze
entrepreneurship by highlighting direct investment opportunities for the private sector. It will finance the
sequence of all activities required to develop bankable business plans for specific investments and operate
on a demand-driven basis.
104. The integration o f IDA, I F C and M I G A instruments and interventions will be critical to
ensure the impact of a PDF. I t can be expected that IFC would, first, play a catalytic role as an investor,
and that its participation in private enterprises in addition to public-private-partnerships (PPP) would help
leverage more private investors as well as local banks. Second, to ensure the sustainability of newly
created enterprises, technical assistance under the IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) for Africa
could be leveraged to consolidate enterprise development. In the same way, newly created enterprises
could also access matching grants to finance costs incurred by recourse to external service providers for
products and markets development and/or for other enterprise development activities. In cases where the
Government will need to support enterprise development through PPP, the Government’s interventions
would be supported by a relevant PPP Framework which will be based on clear government entry and exit
scenarios and code o f conduct.
105. The program will also focus on the development o f a Minimum Integrated Trade Expansion
Platform (MITEP) financed through PRSG V I to foster trade in Rwanda. MITEP will support
enterprise development through sustainable development o f new products and new markets. It will build
a permanent “soft” infrastructure to: (i)help investors identify direct resource transformation
opportunities. (ii)help enterprises comply with quality requirement and other standards in order to adapt
and develop products that will overcome technical barriers to trade (TBT); (iii)support the expansion of
the market of specialized business development services which will aim at building and accessing the
skills sets required for the private sector to effectively identify and develop trade opportunities; (iv)
rationalize and integrate the overall delivery of mezzo level policy advocacy and enterprisekrade support
services. To support the economic transformation, MITEP, combined with the PDF, will be designed to
target sectors with growth potential (including agriculture). Much o f this support will be provided through
a TA program to support program design with implementationthrough the GoR budget.

106. Beyond entrepreneurial skills, the Bank will increasingly focus on skills development to
meet the needs o f the labor market (see above). T h i s will consist of a two-prong approach. First,
building on the findings o f the recent AAA on STI, the Bank will work with Government to design a
small program to build skills and capacity in the private sector to bring Science and Technology
innovations to different areas of economic activity. Second, we will promote a broad strategic
perspective to address short, medium and long-term skills-formation by adopting a systemic approach to
post-basic education, with a comprehensive view o f general secondary, TVET and higher education. This
will take into account the transversal skills set needed to be able to adapt to the changing demands of
sophisticated labor markets and consequently the blurring between the three parts o f the post-basic

26

education system. This integrative approach also implies that focusing on solely one part o f the system
(such as TVET) without the overall strategy being in place could eventually create limitations for further
human capital development. Support for preparation o f this strategy will be provided through the
Education Policy Analysis. The strategy i s expected to be completed in FY 2010 and a skills
development project i s expected to follow in FY 2012. The Bank will also continue to administer the
Education For All Fast-Track Initiative Catalytic Fund grant (see below).
107. Investment climate reforms remain a priority in the proposed program. I D A and IFC/FIAS
are collaborating through the IDA Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP)
and the recently approved I F C Rwanda Investment Climate Reform Advisory Project, particularly
on commercial law reform, capacity building activities o f Rwanda Investment Promotion Agency
(RIEPA), promoting public-private dialogue and supporting the Government’s Doing Business reform
action plan. This work i s underpinned by strong analytical input including the Doing Business Surveys.
An Investment Climate Assessment will be completed in early FY09 and the Bank i s working with other
donors and the Government on a Joint Governance Assessment which includes a section on the Business
Environment and on Corporate Governance (see Annex 3).
108. Strengthening and deepening the financial sector will feature prominently in the support
program. On the side of IDA, additional financing to the CEDP approved in April 2008 supports
implementation o f the key elements o f Rwanda’s Financial Sector Development Plan (payment system,
microfinance, accounting and auditing standards). A second phase o f the ongoing program o f technical
assistance focusing on the insurance industry and the payment system (through the FIRST initiative) will
be implemented. IFC will continue implementationo f a joint IDNIFC Leasing Program, which i s helping
firms overcome financing constraints to acquiring key productive assets. IFC i s also currently providing
support to the National Bank o f Rwanda (BNR) to strengthen its public credit registry’s capacity to fulfill
i t s supervisory functions and prepare the legal framework required to develop credit reporting in Rwanda.
IFC will provide advisory services for securities market and institutional capacity building through its
Efficient Securities Markets Institutional Development (ESMID) program being implemented as a
regional program covering Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. MIGA i s currently underwriting
guarantees for two private investments in the financial sector worth approximately $1Smillion.
’

CAS Outcome 1.4: Management of public resources at central and local levels strengthened

109. I n Rwanda’s resource constrained environment, effective use o f public resources i s even
more critical for achievement of Rwanda’s growth and indeed the broader development agenda.
Particular attention will therefore be paid to strengthening PFM. This will be aligned to the
Government’s recently completed PFM Strategy and Action Plan and focus on a range o f PFM
functions-budgeting,
accounting and auditing, procurement, reporting and external oversight.
Increasing emphasis will be given to building PFM capacity at decentralized levels to ensure that the
growing public resources being channeled to this level are used efficiently. As part o f the PER work
support will be provided for piloting PEFAs at the district level and a second national level PEFA in
2010. The Bank will continue to support GoR in policy development for Rwanda’s intergovernmental
fiscal transfer system and reporting and help further clarify responsibilities for service delivery, human
resource and financial management between the different levels o f Government.

110. The PFM support will be provided primarily through the ongoing Multi Donor Trust Fund
for PFM Reforms, supported by DfID and the EC, through the PFM component of the Public
Sector Capacity Building Project and the PRSG series. The ongoing multiyear PER will also be an
important vehicle for support. After completion o f the activities supported through these instruments, if
additional financing needs emerge that require continued financing, resources could be re-allocated from
the PRSG envelope.

27

111. I t i s critical that the significant scale up of public investments envisaged in the EDPRS i s
well justified, prepared and implemented to deliver the desired results. The Bank will provide
technical assistance and advisory services to help GoR complete and implement i t s Public Investment
Policy which seeks to strengthen the efficiency and impact o f public investments. Key elements o f this
work include developing criteria for selecting between different public investment options, building
capacity for project appraisal (technical, economic and financial) and putting in place institutional
arrangements for proper project preparation, selection and monitoring. In addition support will be
provided for preparing and implementinga framework to guide PPPs. The multi-year Public Expenditure
Review program will be the main instrument for providing this support.
112. The ongoing Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) will continue support for
further refinements to and implementation of Rwanda’s Civil Service Reform. Particular attention
will be paid to core systems32readjusting staffing levels and ministerial structures in line with functional
responsibilities, clarifying mandates and governance arrangements between ministries and associated
agencies and commissions as well as sub national structures. In addition to support provided by DfID, the
Bank will focus on helping the GoR develop a retention and pay policy and conducting a review o f the
various training institutions currently providing continued professional training for civil servants with a
view to consolidatingtraining supply into a single civil service college.
Strategic Theme Two: Reducing Social Vulnerability

113. Under the second strategic theme, the CAS will support selected elements of the Government’s
program in the areas o f social protection (with a focus child and maternal health), and demobilization and
reintegration.
CAS Outcome 2.1: Significant Health and Social Risks-to
in Rwanda-are mitigated

vulnerable groups and to social cohesion

114. Building on Rwanda’s major health sector reforms in recent years support in this outcome
area will focus on: (i)Strengthening the community health, nutrition and family planning agenda; (ii)
consolidating and institutionalizing processes o f autonomous decision-making and local management in
health services delivery via performance-based budgeting and financing; and (iii) strengthening the
reform agenda in relation to human resources for health. IDA support will specifically aim at achieving
progress on the challenging MDGs 4 and 5 and will leverage funding from the Norwegian Health Results
Innovation Grant (HRIG). TA and AAA will support evaluation and further refinement o f the GoR’s
micro health insurance system. The Bank will also continue to play a role in the harmonization agenda in
the health sector including participation in the SWAP and contribute to the discussion o f fiscal space for
the health sector including analysis of the appropriate funding for the sector.
115. The Bank will support the Government in piloting two VUF’ program elements, the publicworks employment program and the “direct supports” program. Support will also include help in
refining the design, strengthening implementation, and monitoring and assessing both impact and initial
experience during the pilots. The Bank will work with the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC)
to plan how these VUP initiatives could evolve with suitable design modifications as needed fiom
evaluation results and the experience gained into effective national core programs o f public-works
employment and poverty-basedsocial assistance that are structured to be administratively simple, fiscally
sustainable, compatible with limited information requirements, and relatively free of adverse impacts such
as distortions in labor markets or significant sources of inequity. The Bank will support the policies
32

Including management information, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation and performance management systems.

28

required for the success o f the ongoing health reform and VUP elements initially through a programmatic
DPL series, which will be merged with the PRSG series within the CAS period.

1 16. Continued support will be provided to the s t i l l critical demobilization and reintegration
agenda. The ongoing support to Rwanda’s demobilization and reintegration effort under the
Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRF’) Trust Fund closes in December
2008. The Government o f Rwanda has recently proposed a third, three-year phase o f the Rwanda
Demobilization and Reintegration Program (RDRP) that would aim to consolidate the past phase’s
achievements. IDA will therefore support a follow operation to finance this next phase which has four
areas o f activity: (i)maintaining capacity to demobilize and provide reintegration assistance to an
estimated 5,500 combatants o f Rwandese armed groups who may return to Rwanda; (ii)demobilizing and
provide reintegration assistance to a further 4,000 soldiers o f the Rwanda Defense Force; (iii)providing
specialized medical and socio-economic reintegration assistance to disabled ex-combatants, and (iv)
mainstreaming provision of a number o f follow-up reintegration activities. IDA resources will leverage
additional resources from other donors33who provided support during the first phase.
Mainstreaming Support to Capacity Building

117. The Capacity Building Filter (CaB)34will help build public sector capacity and strengthen
the participation of civil society in development. I t i s envisaged that the ongoing PSCBP and support
by other donors will help address the key system-wide issues that constrain capacity development and
broader public sector effectiveness. Past experience has shown that, while support through a single project
plus the PRSG series has been useful, the impact o f capacity building measures would be enhanced by
mainstreaming such support across the entire program. This will be done through the implementation o f a
capacity building filter across all our interventions -financial and AAA. For the public sector, projects,
budget support and AAA will seek to ensure skills transfer to Rwandans, strengthen the organizations
they work with and provide adequate policy frameworks and incentives that sustain and encourage
reforms. Capacity constraints will be addressed at individual, organizational and institutional levels to
build skills, organizations and institutions.

118. Each Bank operation will seek to strengthen i t s implementing institutions, to make sure that
these institutions are fully equipped to implement projects in a coordinated way that i s aligned with its
core mandate. This includes the phasing out of Project Implementation Units as well as working towards
using country systems for Bank operations, consistent with Paris Declaration principles. On the demand
side o f reform, the Bank’s engagement will allocate time and resources to allow for adequate information,
consultation and participation o f civil society and other stakeholders in project design, implementation
and evaluation as well as in the production o f AAA. Concretely, the implementation o f the filter will be
achieved through: (i) Reviewing existing projects and strengthening their attention to capacity building.
For all new operations, an annex will be included in the Project Appraisal Document on how the filter i s
to be applied in the specific case; (ii)AAA and technical assistance will focus on areas outlined which
will also be checked at review meetings o f AAA. Financing will be sought from the Governance
Partnership Facility between the World Bank, DflD, and the Netherlands, for implementation o f the
Capacity Building Filter.

Belgium, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
The filter draws on existing experience o f integrating capacity and governance issues into CASs such as in the Lao CAS 2005
(focus on capacity building); Albania CAS 2006 (applied governance filter focusing on PFM, CSR, decentralization and citizen
participation); Mali CAS 2008 (developed a capacity development approach for key sectors).

D. Scaling U p Support to Rwanda
119. There are compelling arguments for scaling up support to Rwanda. The first i s need.
Rwanda i s s t i l l a long way from achieving several o f the MDGs and in the absence o f a much scaled up
effort, only limited progress i s likely to be made. Poverty i s pervasive and severe and growth needs to
become more robust, inclusive and sustainable over time. Rwanda’s financing needs, particularly in the
infrastructure sectors which are critical for growth remain significant. There i s also ample evidence that
Rwanda can absorb additional resources particularly in these sectors.

120. I n the face of this significant need and financing constraint, Rwanda has a leadership that i s
committed to achieving ambitious development goals and Rwanda i s a good performer. The country’s
low level of corruption also minimizes risks that IDA resources will be misused. The EDPRS presents a
good basis for the Bank group to scale up its assistance. The CAS envisages a scaled up program o f
support through a richer menu o f financing options that should allow the Bank Group to seize the
opportunity to contribute to significant development impact in Rwanda.
121. Rwanda’s readiness to become eligible for a mix of I D A credits and grants will be assessed
through regular DSAs. The mid term review during FY 10 will provide an opportunity to review the
classification if the debt vulnerability indicators improve significantly. This would allow a larger IDA
envelope as well as enhance Rwanda’s possibility to borrow from other concessional sources.
122. Beyond an expanded I D A envelope, Rwanda has expressed interest in taking advantage o f
IBRD products for IDA only countries. In particular as appropriate, Rwanda will apply to be considered
for financing o f specific enclave projects under IBRD terms. This will be done in careful consideration o f
debt sustainability. These would ideally be for financing projects with some private sector involvement
which meet other conditions for this program.
123. IDA, I F C and M I G A will also work together more collaboratively to help leverage private
financing for Rwanda’s development program. MIGA plans to engage more strongly to facilitate
private sector investments. IDA resources will also be used more strategically to leverage resources from
additional sources including non traditional sources. Finally Rwanda’s participation in regional
operations will also leverage additional resources beyond its national/country IDA envelope.
E. Partnerships
124. The CAS will seek greater collaboration with other donors in various areas notably on the
private sector development agenda and in the energy sector with the AfDB, on the PFM and Financial
Sector Agenda with the IMF under ongoing IMF/World Bank special initiatives, with the EC on
Transport and increasingly agriculture, and with UK DfID on Social Protection. In our role as lead
donors in three sectors we will help establish stronger frameworks for donor alignment and
harmonization. In agriculture and in energy the Bank i s leading the preparation o f SWAps and i s also cochairing with Government the process o f preparation o f a Joint Donor/Government Governance
Assessment which will inspire a joint Governance framework and work plan. The Bank will also play a
stronger role to attract additional financing from other donors including through use o f silent partnership
arrangements where other donors might support different sectors through the Bank. The Bank will work
with EC and the AFDB to achieve greater harmonization o f our budget support and PFM assistance. The
recently agreed Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) provides an opportunity for the
Bank to harmonize our budget support program and conditionalities with the larger group o f budget
support donors.
125. The CAS also envisages stronger partnerships with non-traditional partners such as China,
India and philanthropic organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There i s

30

growing economic collaboration between China and India. The Bank i s exploring possibility o f joint
support with China to a major agriculture project focused on Land Management, Water Harvesting and
Hillside Irrigation. Several philanthropic institutions have increasing interest in Rwanda and the Bank
will seek ways to collaborate with them on various initiatives.

126. The WBG will facilitate learning and knowledge sharing between more successful
economies in the South and Rwanda. In addition to the twinning arrangement between the Electrogaz
and the Tunisian Power Utility that the Bank i s facilitating, Rwanda participated in the recent China
Africa Experience Sharing Seminar in Beijing, and a study tour o f Rwandan officials to learn the lessons
from successful efforts on targeted poverty programs i s being planned. Other activities will be arranged
in response to demand and as opportunities arise.
F. Results Monitoring and Management

127. Given the results focus of the CAS, strong emphasis i s placed on the results monitoring and
management framework. The results focus will be implemented at three levels: (i)ut the national level
through support to the development o f an effective EDPRS results management system; (ii)ut the Bank
portfolio level through the establishment o f a solid CAS results framework and results monitoring system;
and (iii)
ut the project level through strengthened results management of individual Bank operations.
128. The Bank, and other donors are currently supporting the Government to put in place the
appropriate tools and processes to ensure that an effective results management system i s in place to
track the achievement of the ambitious EDPRS objectives. Results and Policy Matrices linking EDPRS
results measurements and policy actions for all key sectors have been developed. An EDPRS Monitoring
Unit responsible for producing the annual EDPRS progress reports has been established in MINECOFIN
and M&E officers in all Sector Ministries are being recruited to support the collection of relevant EDPRS
sectoral progress data. In order to have reliable data the National Institute of Statistics i s also being
integrated in the EDPRS M&E system. Capacity gaps have been identified in both areas M&E and
Statistics and are being addressed through a combination of training and exchange o f experiences as part
o f an M&E Community o f Practice that i s being created.
129. The upcoming National Statistical Development Strategy (NSDS; 2008-11) i s an opportunity
to strengthen monitoring capacity in Rwanda. This strategy will align statistical production with
EDPRS and sector monitoring requirements, and will support the enhancement o f capacity in a country
already slightly above the IDA average. Capacity assessments have been completed in all districts and
are being undertaken in line ministries. Donor support i s generally coordinated through a basket funding
arrangement managed by UNDP, with participation from the EC and DfID, with commitments for US$20
million o f the estimated US$39 million required to implement the NSDS. To address the shortfall, the
country team intends to apply for funds through the new “Statistics for Results” facility, which i s
currently being set up by the Bank with funding from major bilateral donors. The Bank i s currently
providing support through a Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building in the area o f national
accounting, survey design and analysis for poverty monitoring, and knowledge exchange.
130. To strengthen the national system and avoid duplication of efforts, the CAS Results
Framework i s aligned to the EDPRS M&E framework by linking where possible the indicators, the
data sources and the M&E systems of the Bank operations to the ones of the Government. The CAS
Results Framework presented in Annex 1 i s focused on a set o f EDPRS objectives that the Bank i s
expected to be able to demonstrably influence over the CAS period. The CAS outcomes have been
formulated bearing in mind that results during this CAS period will come mainly from existing
operations, and the quicker-disbursing interventions included in the CAS. Measurable indicators and
milestones have been identified and regular results-focused portfolio reviews will be carried out to asses

31

whether progress i s being made toward CAS outcomes and whether the Bank i s successfully contributing
to the achievement o f the EDPRS objectives. A detailed CAS M&E Plan w i l l be prepared outlining
responsibilities, detailed indicator definitions and data sources.
13 1. All new operations will be designed with a focus on clearly defined outcomes, solid results
measurements and effective M&E arrangements. Although new projects will more systematically
incorporate results management elements, most projects under implementation require actions to improve
monitoring and evaluation. Data collection and reporting on outcomes needs to be improved across the
portfolio and an effort t o strengthen project level M&E i s underway. Project teams will also need to
focus on supporting sectoral ministries in developing sustainable M&E systems which would in turn help
project data collection and reporting.

VI. MANAGING R I S K S
132. Weak implementation capacity i s a key risk. Lack o f capacity was a major constraint to
successful implementation o f the first PRSP and has also been a challenge on past Bank strategies. Risks
are particularly pronounced at decentralized levels. Recognizing the complexity o f the issue, the CAS
will use different avenues t o mitigate this risk: (i)a cross-cutting approach to addressing core capacity
issues, such as public sector management, through ongoing support as well as applying a capacity
building filter across all our operations; (ii)support to capacity building at decentralized levels through
the ongoing Decentralization and Capacity Building project; (iii)ongoing support to P F M reforms
including preparation o f local level PEFAs which will help assess specific areas o f weaknesses at
decentralized levels.
133.
Regional “neighborhood” risks. Political instability and the threat o f conflict are real
possibilities in neighboring countries such as Kenya, Eastern Congo, and the Great Lakes Region. The
Bank’s continued work on demobilization and reintegration issues in the region, including in Rwanda
could contribute to mitigating this risk. The Bank will also closely monitor developments on this front
and proactively make changes to the program as needed in consultation with Government. In addition,
given Rwanda’s landlocked nature, inadequate prioritization o f regional transport links by neighboring
countries could negatively affect trade, export and private sector growth. The spread of migratory
diseases including H I V / A I D S and TB remains a risk in the region and Rwanda i s participating in the
Bank supported Great Lakes Initiative on HIV/AIDS. In general, the strong focus on regional projects in
the CAS i s trying to mitigate these risks and support effective economic integration with an impact on
regional stability.

134. Risks from exogenous shocks. Current high fuel costs, inflation and continued rise in food
prices could affect C A S implementation. Given that 90 percent o f the food consumed i s domestically
produced, the strong focus on improved agriculture productivity will help enhance food security. The
Bank will also work closely with the IMF to help Government design and implement fiscal relief
measures that do not jeopardize the macro-economic framework. The Bank will continue to support
macroeconomic policy stance including a healthy cushion o f external reserves. W e will help risks from
natural disaster through planned support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR) to help Government Mainstream Disaster Risk Reduction in national programs.
135.
Political and endogenous risks. The presidential and legislative elections o f 2010 could pose a
risk if accompanied by violence and social unrest. This risk is currently considered low. We believe that
the strong macro/fiscal program in place together with the government commitment to reforms will
prevent any policy reversals going forward. Our programs are also firmly aligned with Vision 2020
implementation. The ongoing support to the electoral process by other donors should help build the
capacity o f the electoral commission to supervise free and fair elections and further reduce this risk.

Annex 3: Rwanda’s Joint Governance Assessment.
In early 2007, the Government o f Rwanda and development partners initiated a joint assessment
1.
o f Governance in Rwanda. In the past, such assessments were done separately by individual agencies and
development partners including the World Bank, the EC, DfID, the Netherlands, the African
Development Bank and USAID. The fundamental objectives o f this initiative are to: (i)develop a
common (government and donors) understanding o f governance issues in Rwanda; (ii)
reduce transaction
costs by consolidating different donor governance assessment activities; and (iii)provide an objective,
evidence-based assessment that reflects Rwanda’s specific governance history and i t s current context and
realities. The Assessment will also form the basis for identifying areas in the Government’s Governance
program that need greater attention, and for harmonizing governance interventions. It will provide a
framework for regular monitoring o f governance progress in Rwanda.

2.
A Steering Committee (SC) with membership o f key ambassadors, heads o f development
agencies, relevant Government Ministers (Local Government, Finance, Justice, Public Service,
Information), the Presidency, the Private Sector Federation and CSO representatives, and jointly chaired
by the Ministry o f Local Government and the World Bank was set up to lead the process. The SC was
supported by a Joint Technical Committee. Among others, the SC sought to ensure that the Assessment
would be jointly owned by Government and donors, and conducted with a high degree of professionalism
and independence which would lend international credibility to the findings and recommendations. An
international firm-The Policy Practice-was recruited through an open competitive process to carry out
the Assessment.
3.

In carrying out the Assessment, the following research methods were used:
0
Review o f existing governance literature and indicators on Rwanda;
Interviews o f around 200 respondents in Government, civil society and the private Sector;
Stakeholder workshop for over 100 participants in January 2008 in Kigali;
0
Discussion o f draft indicator Framework at the Government and Development Partners’
retreat in March 2008;
Consultations with district government in 5 districts;
0
Regular meetings with the Steering Committee and technical Committee to discuss progress,
earlier drafts and next steps.

The Assessment has recently been completed. I t concludes that Rwanda has made impressive
4.
progress in governance since the 1994 genocide (especially in areas such as peace and security, national
reconciliation, transitional justice, institutions o f accountability, public financial management, the fight
against corruption and decentralization) and identifies remaining challenges in ‘Ruling Justly’,
strengthening ‘Government Effectiveness’, and improving the ‘Investment Climate and Corporate
Governance’. There are three broad tasks that are highlighted for greatest attention:
Institutions need to be further strengthened and rules-based governance more rigorously
enforced;
Vertical accountability between government and citizens needs to be strengthened, in
particular by enabling constructive state-society engagement around participatory processes
such as budgeting, planning and monitoring; and
Transparency and access to reliable information are essential to nearly all aspects o f good
governance.
5.
Recognizing both the scale o f the challenges, and Rwanda’s experience so far that a good deal
can in practice be achieved; the Assessment suggests that the approach to strengthening governance needs
to be ambitious. I t also recognizes there are many linkages between different areas o f governance, such

41

that progress in any one area i s influenced by progress in others. Given resources limitations, the
prioritization and sequencing o f interventionswill be essential. The report will be disseminated widely by
Government and donors following discussion and approval by Cabinet after the summer recess.
6.
The SC has agreed that donors will review their governance programs to ensure alignment with
the recommendations o f the Assessment. Under the newly established EDPRS Results Monitoring
Framework, the coordination o f the implementationand monitoring of the findings o f the Assessment will
be taken forward by the EDPRS Governance Implementation Working Group (IWG) which i s jointly
chaired by the Ministry of Local Government and the UNDP. I t i s expected that the Governance IWG will
agree soon a timeline for the next Assessment.

42

Annex 4: Capacity Building Filter
Weak Capacity Unraveled

1.
Weak capacity slowed down implementation o f Rwanda’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Past experience o f building capacity revealed that “weak capacity” in the Rwandan context can be
disaggregated into a number o f component parts. On government effectiveness, weak capacity can be
traced back to low skills levels, weak core processes and oversight and organizational structures
insufficiently aligned with ministerial functions. In addition, civil society engagement and voice can be
strengthened, supporting the government in i t s existing efforts.

2.
Rwanda emerged from the war and genocide with a drastically reduced stock o f human
capital. Government institutionswere similarly severely undermined o r destroyed. While economic
growth rebounded quite quickly, the human and institutional damage i s taking much longer to repair. As
part o f the institutional rebuilding process, most ministries are s t i l l relatively young - as a result, a
number o f systems, processes and procedures have not been fully put in place and some core functions
need to be better defined.
3.
I n addition, some of Rwanda’s civil service reforms have proven to be counterproductive.
The drastic reduction in public sector staffing has limited the number o f people available to supervise,
analyze, and implement as well as to learn. The adoption o f uniform organizational charts for i t s central
ministries coupled with a grade structure that i s too flat proves to be “uneconomic and inefficient”
(Oxford Policy Management 2007).38 Also, some of the reforms remain unfinished. While the
Government has put in place a large number o f agencies as part o f its outsourcing strategy in an effort to
move implementation away from central ministries, the relationship between ministries and agencies
remains undefined, leading to overlapping mandates, weak supervision and management o f agencies by
their parent ministries. Similar problems exist with the rapid implementation o f decentralizationministerial staff are often not sufficiently aware o f the division o f labor between sub-national levels and
the center and how to effectively supervise activities at the sub-national level.
4.

Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Accountability Assessment was completed in 2007.

It shows that while in some areas the public financial management system performs strongly, in several

other areas considerable strengthening i s needed. The main areas o f difficulty include accounting
recording and reporting, and external scrutiny and audit. Reporting at decentralized levels, i s particularly
weak and a key area o f risk in Rwanda’s decentralization process as increasing resources are
decentralized to districts and lower down. A fully functional integrated financial management system i s
yet to be put in place. Procurement reforms are underway. A sound legal framework has been put in
place and new institutional arrangements for the public procurement function are being created.

5.
A l l these weaknesses combined considerably impact the speed o f implementation o f reforms and
service delivery in virtually all sectors.
Government Response

6.
Cognizant o f the importance o f building capacity, the GoR developed the Multi Sector Capacity
Building Program, spanning public, private and civil society sectors, launched in 2004. It also established
a government agency charged with operationalizing the MSCBP and coordination o f capacity building in
the country, the Human Resources and Institutional Capacity Development Agency (HIDA). The

’*Oxford Policy Management, 2007. Functional Reviews and Institutional Audits o f Six Public Sector Institutions to Assess the
Impact o f Ongoing Public Sector reforms, Final Report.

43

MSCBP follows a comprehensive approach to capacity building: strengthening individual skills,
improving the functioning o f organizations and developing or improving the institutional framework
conducive to capacity and good governance. The World Bank financed Public Sector Capacity Building
Project (PSCBP), effective since March 2005, supports the public sector arm o f the MSCBP. I t addresses
civil service reforms, PFM, strengthens local training institutions and parliament, improves ICT use
within ministries, supports the development o f a national M&E system and provides custom-made
support to priority ministries under the former PRSP, now Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). In addition, Rwanda i s putting in place mechanisms to attract skilled
Rwandans living abroad through programs such as “Transfer o f Knowledge through Expatriate Nationals
(TOKTEN) and Migration for Development in Africa (MIDA).

C A S approach

7.
Past experience in building capacity through the MSCBP and PSCBP has shown that complex
issues such as capacity building and governance can only be partially taken on by a single-project
approach. A comprehensive and cross-cutting approach i s needed. The CAS therefore follows a twopronged approach o f addressing core issues such as public sector management (notably PFM and CSR)
and developing a policy framework for skills building through concrete interventions (such as the existing
PSCBP, a new project on skills development and Economic and Sector Work) and a capacity-building
CaB) filter to mainstream such cross-cutting concerns into the Bank’s operations, analytical activities and
budget support.
The Capacity Building (CaB) Filter

8.
Capacity includes building capable states and engaged societies - both are critical to achieving
development results.39 Effective states means that the government i s capable o f delivering public goods
and services, o f providing an enabling environment for growth and development and ensuring peace and
security. Engaged societies play an important role as they participate in public decision-making,
contribute to provision o f public goods and services and hold authorities accountable. Both elements are
also critical building blocks of the Bank’s Governance and Anticorruption Strategy.

9.
The CaB filter4’ will thus include measures to help build public sector capacity and strengthen the
participation o f civil society in development. The filter i s a tool to mainstream these goals into Bank
operations and analytical work. It seeks to help sector interventions to address capacity and governance
challenges through their operations, analytic and advisory activities (AAA) and budget support and to
ensure that all Bank activities contribute to the same goal. I t intends to aid the declaration of the
Governance and Anticorruption Implementation Plan for the Africa Region that “governance i s
everybody’s business”. The CB focus will be further developed during CAS implementation and secured
in a Worl Bank strategy for capacity building in Rwanda.41

39

This was the main conclusion from the Report of the World Bank Task Force on Capacity Development in AfLica:
Building Effective States-Forging Engaged Societies.
40
The filter draws on existing experience o f integrating capacity and governance issues into CAS such as in the Lao
CAS 2005 (focus on capacity building); Albania CAS 2006 (applied governance filter focusing on PFM, CSR,
decentralization and citizen participation); Mali CAS 2008 (developed a capacity development approach for key
sectors).
41
The strategy might include a check l i s t for projects that allows task teams to ascertain whether they are paying
sufficient attention to capacity and governance issues in their operations.

44

Strengthening Public Sector Capacity

10.
Capacity constraints will be addressed at individual, organizational and institutional levels to
build skills, organizations and institutions.
Individual capacity through skills building:

Five measures are suggested to encourage skills building through Bank operations:

1. Staffing in line with needs. Current staffing levels leave central ministries with an insufficient
number o f people in place to carry out day to day work let alone identify, analyze, define,
disseminate and implement vitally important reforms. In some areas, ministries are in a low
capacity trap where even external technical assistance i s underutilized due to a lack o f
supervision, working with and learning from experts. In addition, the low staffing levels mean
that there i s little scope for newcomers or young professionals to learn on the job. During the
CAS period, a careful review o f staffing levels in line with functions will be completed,
identifying additional staffing needs after taking into consideration efficiency gains through
introduction o f more efficient systems and the completion o f decentralizationreforms.
2. Addressing incentives for performance. To ensure optimal utilization o f existing human
capital, improved human resource management i s key as well as an overhaul of the pay and
retention strategy. Other donors, notably DfID, are engaged in a full roll-out of a performance
management system, an important complementary measure.

3. Developing schemes to attract qualified Rwandans onto public sector jobs and
train/coach/mentor young talented Rwandans (Rwandan Expertise Scheme). This would include
holistic learning through twinning and institutional partnerships.

4. More effective use of technical assistance. Outside experts recruited under World Bank
projects should carry a dual function o f delivering their reports, analysis and other output but also
to transfer knowledge and skills. Including in the TOR of experts the requirement to train
counterparts, teach best practice and work closely with them while delivering the product will be
important ingredients to ensure that skills transfer i s taking place and reliance on foreign experts
i s reduced over time. Agreeing with Government counterparts that key staff will be made
available to work with consultants i s another step in ensuring that transfer of knowledge can
occur.

5. Support Local Training Institutions in all sectors o r engagement.

Existing training
institutions in Rwanda are under-equipped, -staffed and often poorly managed. Supporting their
capacity through training o f trainers and/or institutional partnerships with training institutions in
the region or beyond will be an important contribution to ensuring that training needs can be
catered to sustainably in-country.

Building organizational capacity:

11.
Core functions across the public sector are in need of strengthening. These include PFM, HR
management, strategic planning, ICT, monitoring and evaluation etc. Each one o f these will be supported
through a variety o f projects such as the PSCBP, eRwanda, RCIP, etc. In addition, the Bank will continue
to engage ministries, through MIFOTRA to adapt organizational structures to functional needs, moving
away from the rigid four unit structure.

45

Going further, each Bank operation will seek to strengthen its implementing institutions such as the
Rwanda Environment Agency and the ministries for agriculture, communications, infrastructure etc., to
make sure that these institutions are fully equipped to implement projects in a coordinated way that i s
aligned with its core mandate. This includes the phasing out o f Project Implementation Units as well as
working towards using country systems for Bank operations.

12.
Finally, support to specific institutions will continue such as parliament, the ministry o f finance,
the Auditor General’s Office etc.
Strengthening Institutional capacity

13.
Each reform requires the establishment of the policy or enabling framework and rules of the
game. While each sector will attend to ensuring that the legal framework i s sound, for the area o f
capacity building in particular, the CAS foresees the development o f a post-basic education policy
framework.
Strengtheningcivil society engagement and the local private sector

14.
Unleashing the potential o f civil society and the local private sector are important parts o f
governance reforms, and capacity building. The Bank will work to strengthen external oversight
mechanisms, such as through the media and civil society, as powerful tools to engage society, the
ultimate beneficiary of public sector reforms, constructively in the national reform process. There are
numerous examples of social accountability tools, such as citizens’ guides to government services,
complaint mechanisms, civil society consultations and participation, citizens’ report cards etc. which
could be employed.
15.
Rwanda’s civil society i s still young but plays an increasingly important role in facilitating the
development o f the country. The World Bank can play an important role in supporting this trend by
engaging more actively with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) through consultation and participation
in the production of its AAA as well as throughout project preparation and the use o f CSOs in project
monitoring and evaluation. Also, local CSOs can and should be used more proactively as researchers and
consulting bodies in the preparation o f AAA and delivery o f services.
16.
In addition, the Bank plays an important role in providing access to information on its own
operations and A A A to stakeholders and society at large. Sufficient funds should be budgeted to allow
for consultations and dissemination o f AA products. Each project will ensure that information i s
provided on objectives and results, also working with government counterparts in ensuring that
information reaches vital stakeholders. Similarly, the Bank will continue to strengthen outreach to CSOs
by parliament.

17.
In addition to support to private sector development, the Bank will use local consultants and firms
more proactively such as in AAA as well as in project preparation and supervision. Systematically
teaming up international consultants with local experts i s an important step to building the capacity o f the
local consulting industry.
How to integrate and apply the CaB Filter in the Bank’s work

18.
The Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Strategy as well as the GAC
Implementation Plan for the Africa Region highlight that governance i s everyone’s business. The same

46

holds true for capacity building. Consequently, governance and CB will become a focal area for all TTLs.
Concretely, mainstreaming o f the CaB Filter will be achieved through the following means:

0

In our operations: Review existing projects and strengthen their attention to CB. For a l l new
projects, include an annex in the Project Appraisal Document on how the filter i s applied in the
project, to be discussed during each review meeting.
In our analytic work: AAA and technical assistance will focus on areas outlined in the CaB Filter,
also to be checked at each review meeting o f AAA.
Through budget support: triggers may include key policy decisions and benchmarks that would
support capacity building and governance, addressing skills, institutional structures and processes
as well as voice, participation and civil society engagement.

19.
To this end, project preparation teams will be encouraged to include a governance and capacity
building specialist to help identify ways in which the filter can be adopted to the particular project. The
Bank will recruit a governance specialist based in the Country Office to support project teams. The same
person would develop the CaB Filter in more detail, collate and share experience of projects to build a
knowledge base and draw on experience o f other countries in mainstreaming governance, and capacity
building concerns into the Bank’s portfolio.

Annex 5: Rwanda-Joint IMF and World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (December 2007) 42
Summary

1.
The result of the debt sustainability analysis indicates that Rwanda i s at high risk o f debt
di~tress.4~
Despite reduced risk o f near-term debt distress, owing to debt relief initiatives in the recent
past, exogenous shocks t o exports or imprudent borrowing on nonconcessional terms could cause a rapid
deterioration in the medium-term outlook. The alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that debt
indicators are highly sensitive t o less concessional financing and lower growth, particularly in exports.
The DSA suggests that investment and structural reforms should focus on enhancing private-sector led
growth and protecting Rwanda against shocks.
2.
I n the baseline, Rwanda’s projected external debt burden trajectory breaches one critical
indicative policy-dependent threshold (the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio), and returns to a
downward path thereafter.44Alternative scenarios indicate that shocks to the small export base would
substantially worsen Rwanda’s N P V o f external debt-to-exports ratio and debt dynamics would
deteriorate sharply if external financing were delivered on less favorable terms. These scenarios highlight
the importance o f export promotion and greater reliance on grant financing t o set Rwanda on a sustainable
debt path. Stress tests based on historical averages o f key macroeconomic variables also indicate an
increased risk o f debt distress.

3.
The macroeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario are as follows. On the real
economy front, real GDP growth i s expected to stabilize at about 6 percent for the projection period
(2007-2027) as growth enhancing sectoral strategies -improving agricultural productivity strategy and the
export promotion strategy- take effect and investment in human capital starts to pay off. The projected
increase in real GDP i s also contingent on continuous macroeconomic stability and projected investments
in infrastructure (driven by the needs to advance more rapidly toward the MDGs and address Rwanda’s
severe infrastructure gap). On the external sector front, exports are assumed to grow at a rate o f 12
percent, while imports are projected t o increase by 6 percent over the period 2007-27 mostly driven by
capital goods imports.
4.
With moderate domestic financing and repayment of pre genocide debt, Rwanda’s public
debt burden (including domestic debt) is expected to stabilize over the long term. This trend would
partly offset the increase in external debt, so that the N P V o f total public debt-to-GDP ratio would
increase from 15 percent in 2007 and stabilize at about 20 percent in the long term. Both growth-related
stress tests and no-reform scenarios, where the revenue GDP ratio remains unchanged imply a substantial
worsening in all debt indicators. This underscores the importance o f selecting and investing only in
infrastructure projects with a high rate o f return, undertaking structural reforms to set the stage for robust
private sector growth and improving the revenue effort in order to reduce long-term aid dependence and
attain debt sustainability.

Prepared by the IMF and World Bank staff in collaboration with the Rwandan authorities.
A country i s considered at high risk o f debt distress if the baseline scenario indicates a protracted breach of debt or debt-service
thresholds, but the country does currently not face any payment difficulties.
44 The relevant thresholds are (i)
40 percent NPV debt to GDP ratio; (ii)150 percent NF’V debt to export ratio; (iii)250 percent
NPV debt to revenue; (iv) 30 percent debt service to revenue ratio; and (v) 20 percent debt service to exports.
42
43

48

5.
Reforms are already underway to reduce the cost of doing business, deepen the financial
sector and undertake key infrastructure investments. Rwanda i s also developing an energy sector
strategy to systematically address i t s energy constraints in a sustainable manner. In addition, government
i s elaborating a strategy to develop vocational education and training, and ensure that the education
system i s producing the types o f graduates that are most needed for employment and growth. These
efforts, together with measures to promote exports, should not only raise overall growth, but also help
improve the business and investment climate, and facilitate a strengthening and diversification of the
export base. At the same time, the authorities are committed to reforms to improve expenditure and debt
management and raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio for an eventual exit from donor flows.

Annex 6: Rwanda’s Aid Environment and Donor Coordination4’

1.
Rwanda receives support from about thirty (30) donors, the largest being the USA, World Bank,
UK, EC, and the AfDB. Support i s delivered through three main aid instruments: (a) general budget
support (GBS); (b) sector budget support (SBS); and (c) project-based funding. An increasing level o f aid
i s being channeled through general and sector budget support in line with the Government’s Aid Policy.
Rwanda Aid Policy

2.
The Rwanda Aid Policy (RAP), adopted by the Cabinet on July 26, 2006 and endorsed in a “Joint
Donors’ Statement o f Intent” on November 23, 2006 clarifies the Government’s objectives in terms of
mobilization and management o f Official Development Assistance (ODA). I t seeks to improve the
management o f aid through better coordination and harmonization o f ODA as called for by the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The RAP identifies the six most urgent problems that limit efficiency
and effectiveness o f aid and weaken prospects for the scaling-up of aid over the short and medium term
as:
0

Weak capacity and inability o f the Government to “attract and retain highly qualified and skilled
staff.”

0

Excessive and fragmented conditionality which “may result in problems o f predictability in terms
o f the volume, quality, and timing o f aid.”

0

High transaction costs because “donors continue to place significant demands on government in
terms o f time, reporting needs, and use o f their other resources through numerous missions and
meetings.”

0

Incomplete reporting o f ODA, including that provided by NGOs, because of unwillingness or
inability o f donors to meet the government’s requests for information, but also possibly because
of the Government’s tendency “in some areas to place unstructured demands on Development
Partners (DPs) for information.”

0

Lack o f alignment with government priorities and systems because o f weak strategies in some
sectors as a result o f their low capacity in planning, leading to situations where “too frequently
donors continue to promote their own, often political, objectives at the expense o f government
ownership. Much o f assistance remains o f f plan and o f f budget;” large vertical funds sometimes
create sector distortions; and technical assistance i s “in some instances perceived to undermine
local capacities rather than improving them.”

0

Low volume o f external assistance on concessional terms when there i s a need to maintain
external debt sustainability, while at the same time undertaking in large investments to meet longterm (Vision 2020) objectives.

3.
The RAP aims to address these urgent problems giving paramount importance to country
ownership; preference for un-earmarked budget support but recognizes that all donors may not be able to
provide their assistance under such modality (short o f this, the Government “prefers sector budget support
followed by stand alone projects, which in any event should be recorded on-budget and consistent with
the national plan”); and a number o f other measures. Key challenges to its implementation have included
limited commitment by donors and capacity constraints.
Trend in Aid Flows

4.
Rwanda has had substantial scaling up o f aid flows. In 2006, total ODA was US$602.7 million or
26.5 percent o f GDP. Like much o f Sub Saharan Africa, Rwanda i s highly aid dependent. In line with
the RAP, Development Partners are increasingly providing funds through budget support mechanisms. In
45

This Annex draws extensively from Baelhadj Merghoub and Jane. Kirby-ZakiApril 2008. Rwanda Country

Consultation Report Linking Global Programs and other Aid Modalities to Country Strategies and Systems.

53

2006,26 percent o f external grants in the form o f budget support with an estimated increase to 30 percent
in 2007. Currently, the World Bank and the United Kingdom are the largest budget support donors46
Increases in budget support are set to continue with more Development Partners committing to budget
support, eager to meet the 2010 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness targets related to the use o f
program-based approaches.

5.
Rwanda also receives substantial funds for implementation o f global programs, such as the
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and
Malaria, United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Education for all
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI). Smaller initiatives funded by private philanthropic actors like the
Clinton Foundation, are also growing.
Coordination Mechanisms
6.
Key coordination groups, including the Development Partners Coordination Group (DPCG), the
Budget Support Harmonization Group (BSHG), and Sector and cross-Sector Clusters have been formed
for the Government and Development Partners to interact. These groups have been involved in
preparatory consultations and joint monitoring o f the two Poverty Reduction Strategies Rwanda has
prepared to date. Table 1 below provides a summary of these coordination mechanisms.

7.
With the completion of the EDPRS, new institutional arrangements have been put in place for
monitoring implementation of the strategy. Eight new Implementation Working Groups (IWGs)
reflecting the priority thematic areas o f the EDPRS will serve as the forum to coordinate between sectors,
and between government and development partners, to discuss policy issues and monitor implementation.
Each IWG will comprise stakeholders from related sector groups. SWGs will continue to exist with their
role o f updating sector strategies in line with their logical frameworks and thereafter conduct annual Joint
Sector Reviews. These will feed into the work of the respective IWGs.
8.
Through establishing country-led development and enacting policies that promote alignment and
harmonizationof aid, Rwanda has made progress in ownership, harmonization and alignment o f aid to the
budget. Ownership has been strengthened through the country planning and developing i t s development
strategy (PRSP and the EDPRS) and the Aid Policy which outlines i t s own principles for cooperation and
planning, managing and monitoring aid. A Development Assistance Database (DAD) was established to
serve as interface for data collection, analysis and dissemination o f information pertaining to external
finance.

9.
Harmonization efforts have helped move assistance gradually, to GBS and SBS financing
modalities and promoted SWAps in several sectors with Annual Sector Work Programs. It has also
helped development of joint capacity building programs supported by special pooled funds. Alignment
has been advanced under GBS and SBS financing modalities (42 percent of aid in 2005) through support
provided for capacity building in critical areas o f fiduciary, government effectiveness, etc. Significant
challenges include; (i)diversifying sources and modalities of financing development in terms particularly
of Rwanda’s ability to attract more donors to provide support through Program Based Approaches
including GBS and SBS (66 percent by 2010), and increase the amount of ODA to be “on plan” and “on
budget” (80 percent by 2010; (ii)increasing the predictability o f funding through front-loading
disbursements under GBS and SBS; and (iii)avoiding a pluralist approach concerning determination of
conditionality under the GBS.

10.
Most o f the persisting challenges that need to be addressed relate to “managing for results” Le.
developing and implementing a streamlined monitoring and evaluation and audit system; and moving to
mutual accountability with an independent evaluation system. Yet, even here efforts have been made
through the recently concluded Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) and the Donors’
Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) -to be finalized in September 2008.

46

Budget support donors include: African Development Bank, Belgium, Germany, European Commission,
Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the World Bank.

Aid Effectiveness
11.
As noted above, such good practices are moving forward, but progress i s uneven depending on
planning and management capacities in government at central and at local levels. Donors are also slow in
adapting their policies and procedures to the national system. The policies and procedures governing
implementation o f programs and projects financed under GBS, SBS or project support are not always
consistent. Seemingly and paradoxically, financing, procurement and audit arrangements acceptable to
some donors under GBS may not be so for their financing under sector or project approaches. This
difference o f policy treatment between financing modalities i s explainable by perceived or real fiduciary
risks incurred by dealing with different partner ministries, agencies or others at the national and local
levels.

The EDPRS mentions 12 Cluster Working Groups with 21 Sub-cluster or Sector Working Groups.

Monitoring o f the Paris Declaration

12.
Rwanda participates in the OECD DAC exercise o n Monitoring the Paris Declaration. The OECD
D A C in i t s survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration stated that the Rwandan government and i t s
donors are ushering the aid effectiveness agenda forward, although there i s s t i l l some way to go to
meeting the Paris Declaration targets for 2010. The implementation o f the Rwanda A i d Policy continues
to provide a focus for these efforts. K e y challenges and priority actions are summarized below.

Annex 8: Summary Findings from Independent Evaluations

1.
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) in
2004. Key recommendations include that future IDA assistance focus on reducing poverty and inequality,
using the Millennium Development Goals as an organizing framework. This implies a greater focus on
increasing agricultural productivity, diversifying production, and transforming agricultural output into
higher value-added products. In addition, improving the quality of education and human capital, reducing
population growth, increasing exports as a percentage o f GDP, and enhancing the enabling environment
for private sector development were recommended as priority areas. Additionally, the CAE recommended
that the focus o f assistance to the utilities sector be on delivery o f the most basic services to the
population. Privatization, per se, should not prevail as an objective over reducing poverty and increasing
access to fundamental services like water and electricity.
2.
Although Rwanda was not explicitly classified as a low income country under stress, many o f the
recommendations for those countries are applicable. Increased analytical and advisory services are
critical to help enhance development effectiveness. Drawing lessons from the experiences o f other
countries which underwent profound social and economic dislocation would be helpful to country teams.
The review further recommends that project design be kept simple and adequate IDA resources be
allocated to ensure close project supervision. I t also stated that IDA should continue to closely coordinate
its efforts with other donors, with the objective o f becoming more selective in i t s interventions. IEG
evaluations o f ICRs carried out during this period indicate that the objectives o f programs in a country
with limited capacity should be realistically limited to what can be accomplished. Reform agendas
needed to be kept simple, focused on priority areas, and consistent with country capacity.
3.
The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessments of the portfolio recommended that the teams
put greater effort into integration o f environment in Bank supervision, and enhanced monitoring and
evaluation o f the impacts o f Bank projects and programs. Task teams needed to carry out mid term
reviews of projects, taking into account lessons learned, when preparing additional financing operations.
Additionally, it recommended that when working in countries with weak implementation capacity, special
attention needed to be paid to past portfolio implementation performance when designing new operations,
so it could tailor project design to individual country capacity, and ensure implementation capacity o f
units, and work to advance procurement documentation prior to Board approval.

58

Annex 9 : Portfolio Fiduciary Management

1.
Fiduciary performance o f the portfolio has overall been satisfactory. Post Procurement and
Independent Procurement Reviews conducted in FY07 and FYO8 respectively, rated portfolio
procurement processes as being overall satisfactory during the last two years. Procurement processes
were judged to be transparent with more information available, quality o f procurement documents was
found to be good, and a number o f procurement staff have been recruited. The assessment noted the
significant improvements made since the previous Post Procurement ReviewIIndependent Procurement
Review conducted in October 2005.49 Due to this relatively good performance, prior review thresholds
were raised (particularly) for new projects. For RSSP 11, thresholds were raised from US$200,000 to
US$5 million, and from US$l50,000 to US$500,000 for works and goods respectively, and thresholds
were doubled for the ongoing Urban Infrastructure and City Management project, Transport Sector
Development project and the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation project. Procurement
management challenges on the portfolio include managerial and technical issues at different levels, lack
o f procurement staff in one project, weak staff capacity, and generally result from weaknesses in some
elements o f the systems and processes rather than from deliberate efforts to misuse public resources

2.
Audit reports have been largely received on time. In FY08, 2 audit reports (EFTI and ERwanda) were received late partly due to delays in the office o f the Auditor General which carried out
these audits and in the case o f the EFTI, partly due as well to lack of clarity on how the audit would be
carried out since the operation had been treated as a Specific Investment Operation rather than as
Development Policy Lending Operation. Audits have generally not been qualified. A few audit reports
have not met Bank standards and overall there i s room to improve quality.
3.
Fiduciary management of the portfolio is closely linked with the quality of broader public
fiduciary management in Rwanda. Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) Assessment which was completed in 2007 gives a sense o f where Rwanda stands on fiduciary
management. The report shows that while in some areas the public financial management system perform
strongly, in several other areas considerable strengthening i s s t i l l needed. Rwanda scored better than
comparable Southern and Western African countries and better than countries in the East African
Community on several aspects.
4.
The main areas of difficulty include (timely) accounting recording and reporting, and
external scrutiny and audit. Reporting at decentralized levels, i s particularly weak and a key area of
risk as increasing resources are decentralized to district levels and lower down. The process o f putting in
place a fully functional integrated financial management system i s ongoing and has not reached the stage
where it can reliably support the achievement o f critical PFM objectives. Other areas o f remaining PFM
weakness include: budget credibility; quality o f sectoral planning and resource allocation decisions;
comprehensiveness and transparency o f budgets; management o f emerging fiscal risks; budget execution
controls, including payroll, accounting, recording as well as external scrutiny and audit.

5.
As regards procurement, the government has adopted a number of measures to address
the fiduciary risks to the portfolio and to broader public sector fiduciary management. Rwanda has
been implementing PFM reforms since 2003. Key institutions for PFM including the Office of the
Accountant General, the Office o f the Chief Internal Auditor, have been set up. An Organic Budget Law
(OBL) and accompanying financial instructions have been adopted and an MTEF i s being implemented.
~

Misprocurement was declared in two projects -Human Resource Development Project (US$2,029,261) and Competitiveness
and Enterprise Development Project (US$ 120,045) - in 2005. The misprocurementsrelated to slicing o f contracts to avoid IDA
prior review, failure to issue tenders through ICB, wrong shopping procedures and single source selection criteria. In both
circumstances, the Bank cancelled the amounts.

49

59

The Treasury Management Committee has been created and the first set of consolidated financial
statements for the public sector was prepared for the year 2006 while those for the year 2007 are awaiting
audit. Significant results have also been achieved in procurement performance: (i) a sound legal and
regulatory framework has been put in place; (ii) standard bidding documents have been adopted; (iii)
institutions and processes4omplying with international standards-have been adopted; and (iv) the
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) to regulate and oversee public procurement has been
established. A detailed capacity building plan has been prepared and i s being implemented through the
School o f Finance and Banking in collaboration with external training institutions. But more challenges
remain to be addressed including adequately funding and staffing the RPPA to become fully operational,
training a critical mass of public sector staff in procurement procedures, preparing procurement manuals
for contracting entities and widely disseminating the provisions o f the procurement law and regulations to
the public. A Code of Ethics for participants and provision for disclosure for those in decision making
positions i s also being prepared.

6.
The Government i s about to complete a comprehensive PFM reform strategy based on
the findings of the PEFA and other studies in close consultation with development partners. The
recommendations of the recently completed Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC)
Accounting and Auditing also suggested that Government focus on a few key areas including developing
the Institute o f Certified Public Accountants o f Rwanda under a twinning arrangement with a developed
professional body; support curriculum reform, training o f trainers; delivery o f training programs on IFRS
and ISA; and preparation and dissemination o f learning materials on IFRS and JSA. The PFM reform
strategy will provide a basis for World Bank support to the core elements of PFM strengthening in the
CAS period. Support for implementation of the recommendations o f the ROSC are being taken forward
in the context o f the PSCBP, the Multidonor Trust Fund for PFM reform and the support to the financial
sector.

7.
Rwanda has been selected as a potential pilot country for the use o f the national
procurement system. The essence o f use o f Country system i s that instead o f using the Bank's guidelines
and safeguards, the country's own system would be used when it i s judged to be able to deliver the
equivalent results to the use o f the Bank's system. In Rwanda's case a good part o f legislative and
regulatory framework i s already in place, but more needs to be done to deepen reforms. A World Bank
mission reassessed the OECD/DAC benchmark assessment done in 2007, 56% o f the foundations o f the
system are now in place, compared to 41% found earlier in 2007. During the next mission (planned for
Sept OS) a series of compliance and performance indicators (17) have been proposed. The assessment
will cover the period June 07-March OS.
8.
Successful implementation of the Rwanda Country Pilot for use o f national
procurement systems will be a key objective during the CAS period. The approach will have the
following elements: (i)increase support for implementation o f ongoing reforms in order to address
remaining sources of risk; (ii)support the implementationo f the procurement capacity building program;
(iii)regularly assess progress; and (iv) seize early opportunities to scale up where appropriate.

Date o f ISN: August 16,2006
Period Covered by CAS Completion Report: FY03-08
CAS Completion Report Prepared by: Alema Siddiky and Rema N. Balasundaram

I.
Introduction
1.
This report presents an assessment o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Republic o f Rwanda for FY03-05 and the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY06-08. Therefore, this
CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) and any reference to the “CAS period” cover FY03-08.
2.
The purpose o f this report i s t o assess the Bank’s contribution t o key development results in
Rwanda and t o present a set of lessons for future Bank assistance. Specifically, this CASCR: (i)
presents Rwanda’s long term development goals and highlights the country’s progress toward those goals;
(ii)evaluates the Bank’s contribution to country goals by achieving CAS outcome; (iii)highlights the
performance o f the Bank’s portfolio during CAS implementation; and (iv) draws lessons for the new
CAS. The report i s based on various reference document^'^ and discussions with the Country Team.
Furthermore, it draws from Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
evaluations o f Bank performance.
3.
Overall progress during the CAS period (FYO3-08) i s rated satisfactory. This overall rating
i s based on the sub-ratings for each C A S theme (see section I V for detailed explanation for each rating):
Revitalization o f the rural economy (moderately satisfactory).
Private sector development and employment creation (satisfactory).
Human and social development (satisfactory).
0
Public financial management and governance (moderately satisfactory).

11. Rwanda’s Long Term Development Goals
4.

The Government of Rwanda’s (GoR) overall long-term development goals are outlined i n
i t s Vision 2020.5’ Vision 2020 i s aligned with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and serves as
a basis for GoR’s policies, strategies, and actions aimed at fighting poverty. It sets out the country’s long
term development strategy and articulates ambitious targets by 2020 for increasing GDP per capita to
US$900 (from US$230); reducing the number o f poor people to 25 percent o f the population (from 60
percent); increasing l i f e expectancy to 65 years (from 49 years) and increasing literacy to 90 percent of
the population (from 48 percent). In 2006, the Government prepared the Vision-2020 Umurenge Program
(VUP), a pro-poor growth and export strategy which targets poverty reducing interventions at the
grassroots levels.

5.
Rwanda’s f i r s t Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) provided the medium-term
(2002-2006) operational framework for poverty reduction and growth. The PRSP was endorsed by
the Board o f the Bank and the Fund on August 12, 2002. The PRSP identified the private sector as the
main engine o f growth, with the transformation o f agriculture and the rural economy as the leading
sources o f growth. The PRSP identified six priority action areas: (i)rural development and agriculture
transformation; (ii)human development; (iii)economic infrastructure; (iv) good governance; (v) private
Project Appraisal Documents, Implementation Status and Results Reports, Supervision reports (Aide Memoires, Back to Office
Reports), ESW, etc.
5 ’ Vision 2020 was prepared in 2000.

62

sector development, and (vi) institutional capacity building. The Government has recently completed i t s
second PRSP, now called the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The
EDPRS refocuses Rwanda’s priority on growth and human development with an emphasis on
decentralization and greater role for the private sector.
6.
Annual PRSP Progress Reports (APRs) were prepared by the Government in 2003, 2004,
2005, and 2006. The APRs documented progress towards achieving the PRSP objectives particularly in
terms o f establishing the required institutional and legal frameworks, e.g., trade liberalization,
privatization, public financial management and decentralization o f government functions. The Joint Staff
Advisory Notes (JSANs) by the Bank and the IMF commended the Government on the overall progress
in implementing PRSP priorities and rated progress as satisfactory.

7.
Rwanda has been able to maintain macroeconomic stability and the growth rate averaged
5.1 percent during 2002-06.52 This growth rate, however, remained below the PRSP target o f 6.5
percent. The average per capita growth rate has been low at 3 percent during 2002-2006, due to high
population growth, and low and variable growth in the agriculture and manufacturing sector. The
agriculture sector grew at an average o f 4.6 percent (lower than the targeted 5.3 percent). The average
annual inflation rate increased from 2 percent in 2002 to 9.4 percent in 2007, due to high food and energy
prices arising from low food availability and energy shortages.
8.
There was no substantial reduction in poverty over the last few years. Total income poverty
declined only marginally from 60.4 percent to 56.9 percent. Rural poverty declined from 66 to 62
percent, and poverty in Kigali and other urban areas declined by 3 and 5 percent, respectively. Poverty in
Kigali now stands at 20 percent. Major causes o f poverty and inequality are the l o w level o f agriculture
productivity (lack o f land, poor soil condition, and unfavorable weather conditions), high population
growth and limited progress in production for the market. Lack o f proper use o f modern agriculture input
also slowed down productivity and kept yields significantly below their potential.

111. CAS Strategic Objectives
9.
The FY03-06 CAS and the FY06-08 ISN were aligned with the priorities outlined in the
Government’s PRSP. The CAS focused on four broad themes: i)revitalization o f agriculture and the
rural economy; ii) private sector development and employment creation; iii) human and social
development; and iv) improvement in the effectiveness o f public actions and governance. The strategic
elements o f the I S N focused on: i)strengthening the drivers o f growth; ii)enhancing health, education
and social protection; and iii) state building and governance. For the purpose o f this CAS CR, it i s
necessary to consolidate the CAS and ISN into one assessment framework and four CAS thematic areas
(see Table 1).

10.
Neither the CAS nor the ISN were “results-based”. However, the CAS included 25 CAS
monitoring indicators and was aligned with the PRSP Policy Matrix. Based on these CAS indicators, as
well as the monitoring frameworks that were established under the series o f PRSGs, a set o f CAS
outcomes have been derived for the purpose o f this report. This “retrofitted” CAS results framework i s
included in Annex 1 and progress made in terms o f achieving these CAS outcomes are described below.

52 The

growth rates for 2007 & 2008 are estimated at 6 percent.

IV. CAS Outcomes
CAS Theme 1: Revitalization of the Rural Economy

11.
The Bank supported Rwanda’s effort to renew the rural economy with a focus on implementing
measures to improve agriculture productivity, and to improve access to infrastructure and basic rural
economic and social services. Table 2 summarizes the progress in key indicators.

Key CAS Monitoring Indicators
Growth o f Agriculture Value Added.

Adoption o f the Land Law.
Proportion o f rural and urban household with

FY03-08 Progress

Agriculture value added (in YOo f GDP) declined from 8.3%
(2002) to 4.5% (2007).
Achieved in 2005.
Increased from 48% (2003) to 71% (2007).
Increased from 23% (2002) to 40% 2006.

12.
Progress under the first CAS theme i s rated as moderately satisfactory. Progress was made
in terms o f strengthening institutional, technical and legal frameworks for improvement in agriculture
productivity and rural income. Achievements in increasing rural water supply and sanitation have been
impressive. The Bank’s intervention has been relevant in improving the overall social and economic
services in rural areas. Progress towards improving agriculture service delivery was initially slow, due to
weak implementation capacity, but the Bank adjusted to this situation through strengthening institutional
capacity.
13.
Agriculture productivity and growth should continue to be the medium term focus o f the
future Bank’s strategy. Important measures include increasing the use o f inputs, like water management
and harvesting, improving access to fertilizer, seeds and to rural micro finance. Rural farm and non-farm
development should continue be a focus o f the Bank’s support. Future operations need to focus on
improving rural infrastructure.

Outcome 1.1: Agriculture Productivity and Rural Incomes raised

14.
This CAS outcome focused on shifting from a subsistence-based to a market-oriented agricultural
system by improving productivity, exports, agriculture service delivery and structural reforms to improve
rural incomes.
Improvements to the institutional arrangements for the agricultural sector. The Bank
15.
through a series o f Poverty Reduction Support CreditdGrants (PRSC/G I-III),
Institutional Reform Credit
(IRC) and the Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP I) supported the Government in undertaking key
reforms and investments to improve management o f the agricultural sector. In 2004, the Government
formulated a National Agricultural Policy, which was operationalized in 2005 with the launching o f the
Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation (PSTA). In addition to the PSTA, the Rwanda Agriculture
Development Authority and the Rwanda Animal and Resources Development Authority were created. A
sector MTEF for agriculture was developed in 2005, and aligned with the sector strategic plan and i t s
outcomes. Since 2006, there have been earmarked transfers to districts for sector priorities such as
extension services, erosion control, rural infrastructure, hillside irrigation and food security. On the
producer level, the RSSP 1 strengthened institutional arrangements by providing training to over 5,000
farmers associations.
16.
Key marshlands and hillsides rehabilitated o r developed and extension services provided to
farmers. Under the first phase o f the RsSP~’~ more than 3,018 ha o f marshlands have been rehabilitated
and developed for irrigation and 10,089 ha o f surrounding hillsides have been rehabilitated or protected to
prevent land degradation and soil erosion. Improved cropping technologies have been provided and
beneficiaries trained and encouraged to plant, manage and monitor seedlings. As a result, there’s been an
increase in rice yield o f over 100 percent (moving from 3MT/ha to 6.1 MT/ha). These investments in
53 The RSSP I APL (Adaptable Program Loan) series i s seeking to raise the productivity and expand the employment o f resources
that the rural poor own or depend on by providing the required technology, infrastructure, support services, and institutional
capacity.

65

combination with the institutional support o f producer organizations and training o f 5,000 lead farmers
has laid the ground for productivity-raising interventions in subsequent phases (RSSP2). The program
initially lacked adequate implementation capacity in the project unit and procurement capacities and
suffered from an overly ambitious, dense and complex project design. However, following a project
restructuring in 2005, the project outcome started to improve.

’’

17.
The Bank’s Agriculture Policy Note and the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
contributed to policy reforms by identifying key constraints to agriculture productivity and growth.
The CEM highlighted the need for an increase in agriculture productivity as a pre-requisite for meeting
the growth target in the EDPRS over the medium-term. Recommendations from both studies have also
formed the basis for RSSP2 and shaped the policy dialogue under the PRSC/G series.
18.
Adoption of a Land Law guaranteeing tenurial security. The acute scarcity of land i s by far
the most critical constraint facing rural households in Rwanda. The Bank’s Institutional Reform Credit
(IRC) supported a land policy and law guaranteeing tenurial security and potentially permitting the
development of a land market. The new land law also enables women’s land inheritance, ownership
rights and resulted in an improved use of land.
Outcome 1.2: Rural Social and Economic Services Improved

19.

This outcome focused on improving rural infrastructure services particularly in water and
sanitation, and access to rural markets and services.

20.
Improved water supply and sanitation services in rural areas. Achievements under the RuraZ
Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Project have been impressive: i) 408,000 people in 16 rural
communities; and ii) about, 65,000 school children in 105 schools gained access to improved water
supply and sanitation services. At the national level about 600,000 people gained access to potable water
(compared with only 60,000 in 2002) and water consumption increased from 5 liters per day in 2001 to
10.7 liters per day in 2008. The PRSC/G series supported the Government’s overall reform program in
the sector, specifically the highly successful public-private partnerships (PPP) of rural water services on
the decentralized level. PPP currently manage over 25 percent of the rural water supply and sanitation
systems are managed compared to 1 percent 2004. Overall, access to water increased from 44 percent in
2003 to 71 percent in 2007 setting Rwanda on the path to meet the water MDG.
2 1.
Improved access to market and social services. RSSP I supported the construction of 22 rural
markets, 12 km of feeder roads, 19 small bridges, 52 stores, 9 milk collection centers and 20 grain drying
floors. In addition, 3 agriculture research centers and 3 farmers’ service centers have been completed.
District schools, health centers, bridges, and local roads were rehabilitated as part of 141 sub projects
facilitated through the Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP). A total 14
districts benefited from this project, which supported implementation of Government’s “one cow per
family” policy. DCDP provided over 440 cows to different provinces (based on poverty levels),
constructed shelters and initiated a parallel program o f soil erosion control.
CAS Theme 2: Private Sector Development & Employment Creation

22.
During the CAS period the Bank supported Rwanda’s policy and institutional reforms in addition
to investments in infrastructure to develop an efficient private sector that generates employment and
enhanced productivity.

’‘RSSP 2 i s expected to be discussed at the Board on June 24.

Increased from 11.8% (2002) to 12.8% (2008)
Increased from 34.3% (2002) to 37% (2007)

Achievements under this theme are rated satisfactory. Rwanda made considerable progress in
23.
improving the financial sector and modernizing the legal and regulatory framework for commercial and
financial transactions. In addition, the banking sector was privatized and regulation and supervision was
strengthened. A regulatory framework for microfinance was also created. Most o f the policy measures
for financial sector reform outlined in the CAS and PRSP were implemented.
The business environment improved and key enterprises were reformed, restructured o r
24.
privatized. The privatization program i s almost complete except for Rwandair, Banque de Kigali and
few tea factories, which are expected to be privatized in the near future. In addition, a number o f
institutional and strategic reforms were developed in some sectors (e.g. coffee, tea etc.) to improve
investment and export promotion. The exports in major traditional cash crop (tea, coffee) increased
significantly but further export diversification i s warranted. M a i n obstacles to further progress in this area
include: lack o f strategic focus, poor coordination among the Government sectors and lack o f capacity to
design and implement trade development program and reforms. The new CAS needs to focus on
complementing key policy reforms with adequate investment in future Bank operations.

25.

Progress has been made in improving short term electricity shortages, access to water in
urban areas and improving information technology services. However, much remains to be done in
terms o f district and city management capacity and urban upgrading. It i s too early in the implementation
phase to measure overall impact o f urban services through the Bank’s intervention. The Bank’s future
strategy needs to focus on long term sustainability o f infrastructure services particularly with respect to
increased access to electricity.
Outcome 2.1: Efficiency of financial institutions improved
26.
The objective of the above outcome i s to strengthen the financial institutions in Rwanda and
make them more efficient. Key milestones under this outcome included: divestiture o f Government’s
holdings in the banking sector and ratio o f non-performing loans to total loans.

27.
Performance of major financial institutions improved. The Bank provided support through
the Institution Reform Credit (IRC) and Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) to
the strengthening o f the banking sector. Progress in improving the financial sector i s commendable: (i)the
Banque Nationale du Rwanda (BNR) and Banque Commerciale du Rwanda (BCR) successfully
implemented measures to reduce costs, recover defaulted loans and enhance efficiency; (ii)the rate o f
non-performing loans declined from 3 1 percent in 2003 to 22 percent in 2006; and (iii)B C R and the
Banque Continentale Afiicaine au Rwanda (BACAR), were successfully privatized in 2005 and sold to
foreign strategic investors, improving the soundness and competitiveness o f the banking sector.

67

28.
The performance of banks and the Union des Banques Populaires du Rwanda (UBPR) has
improved. In 2002, BCR, B A C A R and UBPR accumulated a combined loss amounting to about US$20
million. In 2006, the three banks became profitable with a combined profit (before tax) o f about US$8
million. From 2002 to 2006, total loans from these three banks increased by 30 percent compared to 16
percent for other banks. During the same period, total assets increased by 28 percent compared to 19
percent for the other banks. UBPR, which represents a very significant portion o f the microfinance
sector, was recapitalized and restructured in 2003 through the Bank’s CEDP. UBPR i s now profitable,
and with some 500,000 members and assets o f approximately US$80 million, the largest financial
institution in Rwanda in terms o f market penetration, and the third largest in terms o f assets. Progress
was also made toward the transformation o f UBPR into a commercial bank, which i s expected to lead to
greater access to financial services for a larger number o f UBPR account holders.
29.
Institutional and Regulatory Framework Strengthened. The Bank also supported: i)
strengthening o f banking sector regulation; ii)creation o f a regulatory framework for microfinance; and
iii)establishing a new independent regulator for the insurance industry. A joint Bank-Fund Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was prepared during 2005 identifying a number o f areas for
reforms.55 and facilitated the preparation o f the financial sector strategy to strengthen: i)microfinance
intermediation, supervision and regulation; and ii)as well as the microfinance policy and regulatory
framework. In addition, the Bank assisted the Government to obtain financing from the FIRST Initiative
to develop a detailed Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), which was completed in M a y 2007 and
has been endorsed by the Government and other stakeholders. In order to strengthen the capacity o f
financial institutions, a School o f Finance and Banking was established. The implementation o f theFSDP
i s now being supported by the CEDP.
Outcome 2.2: The environment for the private sector improved and competitiveness enhanced

30.
This outcome concentrated on streamlining the business environment and improving exports in
major cash crops to enhance investment

3 1.
Investment Climate Improved. With support from the CEDP, PRSC/G I-111and a Regional
Trade Facilitation project, the Government made considerable progress in improving the business
environment. Some major achievements are: (i)14 commercial laws were improved and harmonized; (ii)
the Investment Code was revised t o align with the Tax Code; (iii)four commercial courts have been
created; and (iv) judicial procedures were simplified by streamlining appeals and imposing time limits
speeding up contract enforcement. The resulting time and cost saved by businesses have been substantial
and it has also led to more businesses using the court system. Progress has also been made in reducing
the time required to establish a business and improving the overall legal framework and contract
enforcement. Doing Business 2008 reported that it took 16 days to open a business in Rwanda down from
40 in 2003. T o further improve this performance, the IFC investment climate reform advisory project
recently started to provide technical assistance on business licenses/permits and trade regulations. The
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in 2006 covered 340 f i r m s and a range o f industries. The
preliminary findings and recommendations o f the ICA regarding the perceived major business constraints
(poor infrastructure, access to finance, taxation and business regulations) i s being used to guide the new
CAS and subsequent operations.

The FSAP recommendations included: i)enhancing the Central Bank o f Rwanda’s (BNR) autonomy and supervisory powers;
ii)upgrading accounting, auditing, credit information and payment systems; iii)strengthening the legal and regulatory framework
for the non-bank financial sector; iv) developing more active money and foreign exchange markets; and v) modernizing the
judicial framework.
55

68

32.
Exports and investment promotion. The Bank supported strengthening o f the Rwanda
Investment and Export Promotion Agency (RJEPA) to assist potential investors and deliver required
approvals, certificates and work permits for new investment projects. A time-bound and monitor-able
Export Promotion Strategy and Action Plan were developed based on the result o f the Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS). As follow-up to the study, an area close to Kigali Airport i s currently being
designated as an export processing zone. A law was passed in 2003 to define the role o f OCIR-tea and
OCIR-cafe (former commodity marketing boards for tea and coffee), to improve the capacity o f small
holders and facilitate their access to inputs. Overall, exports as a share o f GDP increased from 8.3
percent to 10 percent between 2002 and 2007. Private investment as a share o f GDP increased from 11.8
percent to 12.8 percent between 2002 and 2008.
33.
Exports of the key commodities coffee and tea increased. The Bank supported implementation
o f the Fully Washed Coffee Strategy helped to increase the volume and production o f fully washed coffee
and the number o f coffee washing stations increased from 11 in 2002 to 84 in 2006. As a result, coffee
exports increased from US$15 million in 2003 to US$35.7 million in 2007. The average price paid to
coffee producers increased from RwF60 per kilogram to RwFl 10 per kilogram during 2003-2005. Tea
production increased steadily from 13 million kilograms in 2004 to 16.6 million kilograms in 2006 and
receipts from tea exports increased from US$22 million in 2003 to US$32 million in 2007, despite slow
progress experienced in the privatization o f tea factories due to difficulties in attracting both foreign and
domestic investors. The Bank assisted the Government to restructure the remaining tea factories. In
addition, the Bank supported capacity building activities for farmers and tea cooperatives to empower
them and enhance the quality o f tea produced.
Outcome 2.3: Efficiency of infrastructure services (energy, urban, transport, water) improved

34.
This outcome sought to improve the quality o f energy (electricity, telecom) and water services,
improving access to urban services by strengthening urban institutions and rehabilitating and maintaining
major roads.
35.
Reduced electricity supply shortages. The Bank responded to severe electricity supply
shortages in 2004 (due to depleted hydroelectric reservoirs, lack o f investment in new generation, a
dilapidated network and sharp increase in demand) and supported implementation o f Government’s
emergency action plan through the Urgent Electricity and Rehabilitation Project (UER). The UER
project initially experienced delays in the main generation investments as well as the rehabilitation o f the
electricity network. In addition, limited capacity created challenges in project implementation for which
the Bank soon provided direct technical support. Furthermore, policy dialogue within the PRSG
facilitated to provision o f extra funding to increase electricity generation capacity. The Government also
responded quickly to initiate progress on Lake K i v u methane gas development. A 3 5 M W power plant
from Lake K i v u i s being prepared with support from the Bank and IFC. The Bank i s supporting the
Government in arranging a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) which will improve the electricity coverage
from current 4.5 percent to 15-16 percent by 2012.
36.
The performance of the utility companies improved. The PRSG/C dialogue also contributed
to the establishment o f the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA) as a multi sectoral regulatory
agency to oversee private investments in water, electricity and telecommunications. Although RURA i s
fully operational i t s capacity to function effectively and independently remains weak. The structure o f
telecommunications licenses was reformed in 2006 to increase competition and in September 2005 the
state-owned operator Rwandatel was sold to a private investor. However, the Government was not
satisfied with the low level of investment and poor performance o f the company and decided to buy back
the company in July 2007. The Government sold again 80 percent o f the company t o foreign investors

69

for US$lOO million (five times higher than the first privatization) in November 2007. The new investors
are expected to bring additional investments o f more than US$200 million.
37.
Improvements in the electricity and water utility. In 2003, Electrogaz (electricity and water)
was placed under a five year management contract to restructure the company prior to partial or full
privatization. The Bank advised the Government to improve the efficiency o f the company and to
mitigate the 2004 power shortage. Tensions o f dealing with the shortage eventually led to the
Government terminating the management contract and transition to a Rwandan management team in
2006. Electrogaz has now embarked on critical reforms to improve i t s performance and has recently
made some strides in i t s financial performance. The CEDP project helped purchase the equipment and
software to improve EZectrogaz quality and services. The number o f connections for water and electricity
increased from 28,150 and 48,581 in 2001 to 47,276 and 86,537, respectively, in 2007.
38.
Improved quality and access to urban services. The Bank’s primary support through the
Urban Infiastructure and Development Project facilitated the improvement o f infrastructure and urban
services in Kigali and two secondary cities. Since the effectiveness o f the project in June 2006, all
priority city-wide and district level investment programs are under execution and ready to be handed over
to the beneficiary local governments in Kigali and Ruhengeri (reaching about 150,000 people). Slum
upgrading and l o w income land development areas pilot projects are being implemented but more slowly
due to the novelty o f the approach and weak capacity o f local governments. The project aims to
strengthen local authorities through training programs and to improve municipal and urban management.
The PRSC/G series supported the Government’s adoption o f a water policy and law, and developed
guidelines for district level contracting o f private water supply and sanitation operators. In addition,
donor coordination and sector expenditures improved over the CAS period resulting in improving the
effectiveness o f strategy development and financing in this sector. The PRSG helped the Government to
move from a project to a sector wide approach and from a centralized to a decentralized one with districts
fully in charge. The Government successfully implemented district water supply projects directly
financed from the national budget. This contributed to the increase in water access (from 48 percent in
2003 to 7 1 percent in 2007) mentioned above.
39.
Progress has been made in Information Communication Technology (ICT). The Bank
financed PRSG series, along with the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) and eRwanda
project have helped implement Government’s National Information and Communication Infrastructure
(NICI) plan. E-ICT has provided training to 994 people in various computer skills. In addition, through
“computers in school initiatives” 1,138 laptop and 2000 computers have been deployed to primary and
secondary school respectively. About 1,000 teachers have been trained in basic computer literacy and
have been deployed to 120 primary schools. Furthermore, a number o f urban and rural schools including
40 schools in Kigali city now have internet access. In addition, the PSCBP provides training to civil
servants and parliamentarians.
Improved access and reduced transport costs. The recent Transport Sector Development
40.
Project supports rehabilitation o f key infrastructure, employment generation in rural areas, improving
road maintenance, and restoring sector capacity. The project i s s t i l l in an early phase, but already helped
to set transport targets for the new EDPRS and address policy weaknesses that had been identified in
Bank assessments. The DTIS notes that infrastructure costs (particularly transport costs) lower returns to
farmers and pose a substantial constraint to trade and export. The policy dialogue through the PRSC/G
series helped the Government to adopt a transport policy framework. The framework aligns transport
objectives and processes with the macroeconomic agenda in addition t o monitoring sector performance
with regards to reduced transport costs and transit times.

CAS Theme 3: Human and Social Development

4 1.
The Bank’s strategy focused on improving service delivery in education, health, HIV/AIDS and
demobilization and reintegration o f ex-combatants.
42.
Progress under this theme i s rated as satisfactory. In education, there has been significant
progress toward the CAS outcome o f improved access to education but quality remains a challenge and
improvements in this area will require more time. The education system at primary level needs to be
better aligned with future labor skills and a long term policy to professionalize teaching needs to be
developed. This would include improving teacher qualifications and strengthening capitation grants with
a focus on results.
43.
Access to health care facilities and health management improved. Roll-out o f health
insurance schemes (mutuelles) and performance based contracting improved access to health services for
the poorest. As a result, infant and under-five mortality rates declined substantially in the last few years,
putting Rwanda on a path to potentially reach the MDG target. Despite this progress, challenges remain
to reduce physical, geographic and financial barriers to accessing high quality services. The Bank needs
to continue to work toward improving reduction in mortality and morbidity rates, and support the
Government in sustaining and expanding affordable health care facilities. For the future strategy it would
be beneficial to put into place better mechanisms to monitor the impact on the ground.
44.
The Bank contributed significantly to improved prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDs.
The Bank’s intervention successfully combined information about HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, and
l i f e skills with income generating activities. It helped to establish solidarity mechanisms bringing
vulnerable people (mostly children and women) together and design their own solutions. The M A P
project complements PRSC/G activities to create synergies between different instruments for most
effective Bank support. The current H N prevalence rate o f about 3 percent i s unfortunately difficult to
compare with earlier figures, but there i s evidence that infections declined.
45.
There’s been satisfactory progress in re-integrating and demobilizing ex-combatants. The
Bank’s support contributed to consolidate peace in the Great Lakes region and foster reconciliation within
Rwanda in the long term.

Access to basic education improved but quality remains an issue. Under the Human Resource
Development Project (HRDP) and PRSC/G (I-111), the Bank provided technical and financial support for
rehabilitation and construction o f schools; training teachers and development o f capitation grants for
primary schools, creation o f sector MTEF and provision o f District Education Funds to promote access to
the vulnerable segments o f the population. Access and completion numbers improved (see Table 5), but
the latter in addition to other quality indicators (e.g. transition rates to secondary education) s t i l l warrant

71

further efforts. in addition, the number o f teachers did not increase in parallel with a rapid expansion in
primary education enrollment. However, the proportion o f qualified teachers increased from 63 to 87
percent between 2001 and 2006. Limitations the recruitment and training o f new teachers i s hampered by
capacity constraints at national and local levels.
48.
Improved education sector policy framework. The Bank supported the adoption o f an Organic
Education L a w (2003) and an Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP), which delivered a number o f
significant policy changes. The introduction o f free compulsory primary education has helped widen the
access to education. Capitation grants (transfer per student) increased dramatically from RwF300 per
student in 2004 to RwF 5,300 (about US$lO) per student in 2007. The provision o f capitation grants
directly to schools improved their purchasing power, which-combined with the decentralization o f the
recurrent budget from 41 percent in 2006 to 5 1 percent in 2007-facilitated
community involvement and
accountability in service delivery. The Government completed a Long Term Strategy and Financing
Framework (LTSFF) for the next ten years (2006-2015), which donors endorsed. In 2006, Rwanda
qualified for support under the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI).
49.
The Bank prepared a Country Status Report for Education (CSR) to provide a better
understanding of the education system in Rwanda. The report was used as an analytical background
for the preparation o f PRSG 1. The study also benefited Government and development partners as a
useful tool in discussing Rwanda’s vision for the education sector and implementing government policies.
Outcome 3.2: Performance of the healthcare system and services improved

50.
Bank support concentrated on enhancing the quality o f health facilities (through a contractual
approach)56and expansion o f drug and rnutuelles insurance coverage.

Health services improved through performance-based contracts. The Bank supported the
5 1.
health sector through i t s technical support and policy dialogue under the PRSUG series. The Bank also
prepared an analytical report called Health and Poverty in Rwanda with recommendations that influenced
the key reform measures taken under the PRSUG. The PRSC/G operations played a vital role in
strengthening the overall health system in Rwanda through a performance-based contractual approach
which was piloted in several districts in 2005 and scaled up nationally in 2006. This community health
scheme transferred around US$0.50 per capita directly to municipalities to engage community
institutions, NGOs, associations o f health promoters, and private operators in the delivery o f essential
services. In 2006, the Government signed contracts with 30 municipalities and in 2007, the contractual
approach was further expanded t o all district hospitals. Community health insurance coverage increased
from 7 percent o f the population in 2000 to 75 percent in 2007.

56

Contractual health approaches are community health schemes with a focus on performance o f service providers.

72

52.
Increased affordability o f health services. The PRSGs promoted reforms to strengthen the
community health insurance system (mutuelles), which enables access to health services at affordable
costs. MutuelIes have been piloted over the last five years and the coverage o f their coverage increased
from 27 percent o f the population in 2004 to 70 percent in 2007. Government transferred funds to cover
premiums for the poorest increased from U S $ l per capita in 2002 to US$8 in 2006. The Government i s
currently in the process o f creating district pooled funds and fund for reinsurance.
Outcome 3.3: Strengthen prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable groups

Bank support focused on strengthening the full range o f preventive measures for people living
53.
with HIViAIDS and on improving capacities at all levels to manage a national response.
HIV/AIDS services and treatment expanded. The Bank supported Rwanda’s HIV/ALDS
54.
initiative through the H I V / ! I D S Multi-Sector Project ( M P ) , which led to the following results: (i)
voluntary counseling and testing provided to about half a million people; (ii)12 million condoms
distributed; (iii)5,000 patients placed on life saving anti-retroviral therapy; (iv) financial assistance for
school fees provided to about 27,000 orphans and vulnerable children; (v) access to community health
insurance schemes subsidized for over 52,000 households; and (vi) 100,000 individuals participated in
income generating activities. The capacity to diagnose, treat and follow up on AIDS patients has been
established at 12 district hospitals and a health center. The M A P program i s currently being decentralized
to an additional 18 health centers and additional financing o f US$lO million was approved by the Board
in February 8,2007.’’

55.
The performance based contracting resulted in rapid expansion of H N services and
stimulated innovations in service delivery (e.g., outreach activities to expand H N testing,
promotion couple testing). The M A P project was reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
which found the Bank’s performance fully satisfactory and commended the team for the speedy
preparation and the high quality o f the work. Strategic relevance, timeliness, policy and institutional
aspects and implementation arrangements, and Bank inputs and processes were rated Highly Satisfactory.
The Q A G review also highlighted the need for more intensive supervision o f the environmental aspects
and for better documentation o f the gender and social dimension o f the project.
Outcome 3.4: Ex-combatants demobilized and successfully re-integrated into civil society.

56.
The overall objective o f this outcome i s to demobilize ex-combatants and support their transition
to civilian life, help them reintegrate socially and economically and facilitate the reallocation of
government expenditures from security to social and economic sectors.
Ex-combatants demobilized and successfully re-integrated into civil society. Through the
57.
Rwanda Emergency Demobilization and Integration (RLIRP) project, the Bank supported reintegration o f
20,039 former soldiers from the armed forces and 6,423 former militias (with the goal being 16,000) and
support their transition to civilian life. The project beneficiaries have already started reintegrating into
community networks, local economies, and social protection mechanisms.

The additional financing will fill an unanticipated financing gap and consolidate the gains from the initial investments,
focusing on interventions with the most significant impact in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care.

CAS Theme 4: Improving the effectiveness o f public financial management and economic
governance

5 8.
The Bank strategy concentrated on improving economic governance and transparency,
particularly through institutional and regulatory reforms to strengthen capacity in public financial
management and procurement including at decentralized levels.

Key CAS Monitoring Indicators
Adoption o f the Organic Budget Law and the Procurement Code.
Adoption o f and progress in the implementation o f the Plan to
improve financial accountability.
Preparations o f regular account o f government financial operations.

FY03-08 Progress
Submitted in 2005.
Procurement code submitted to parliament in

2006.

Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP)
comdeted in 2007.

59.
The progress under the CAS theme i s rated as moderately satisfactory. Public financial and
expenditure management in Rwanda improved during the last four years. Despite Rwanda’s weak
institutional capacity the planned reforms envisaged under the CAS period have been implemented. In
particular, the Bank supported operations helped to improve its budget planning and operations and
strengthened the PFM system. Some accomplishments have been made in terms o f improving service
delivery in local government and bringing in results, capital improvement in rehabilitating schools, new
health centers etc. Citizen’s voice and accountability was strengthened through adoption o f citizen report
cards and community score cards. However, progress in building capacities within public institutions has
been slow. In future efforts are needed to improve coordination, building capacity among sectors, central
and local governments to improve the overall PFM process.
Outcome 4.1: Public Finance and Expenditure Management Strengthened

60.
This outcome focused on improving public finance and expenditure management through more
transparent budget formulation, execution and reporting. I t sought to strengthen the linkages between
strategic planning, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the national budget.
61.
An improved budget process. The PRSC/G series supported the 2006 Organic Budget law to
support more accurate identification o f capital investment and recurrent expenditures and better alignment
o f budget spending with policy priorities. A Joint Monitoring System was introduced in 2003 with a
computerized financial software package. The system o f zero balance account i s operational and now all
Government budget agencies are using zero balance sub accounts. A l l sector ministries and districts
adopted MTEFS, which helped to improve budget predictability, budget preparation, implementation and
monitoring. Except for the district level, where MTEF’s are not yet aligned with available resources. The
2003 PER highlighted the problem of late expenditure release and pointed to difficulties in budget
preparation.
0

62.
Public Financial Management Reform Agenda Implemented. The Bank supported
implementation o f the the public financial management reform agenda through the Institutional Reform
Credit (IRC), the PRSC/G series and the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) and important
analytical work such as the Public Expenditure Review. This agenda includes a range o f interventions
including (i)the adoption o f the Organic Budget Law (2006); (ii) the appointment o f the Government
Chief Internal Auditor and Accountant General; (iii)adoption o f the SMARTGOV budget system; and
(iv) establishment o f the Treasury Management Committee. Despite implementing key reforms in the
PFM area capacity in public accounting remained a key challenge during the CAS period. Rwanda
continues to experience a shortage o f qualified professionals to meet the needs in public financial

74

management and procurement. The Bank along with other donors repeatedly highlights the need to
strengthen Government’s leadership and coordination in PFM reforms in order to accelerate
implementation o f PFM reforms. To provide additional support to the reform program, the development
partners established a Multi Donor Trust Fund for PFM Reform. A Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) was carried out and the GoR will use its findings to update the PFM
action plan.

63.
Procurement reform agenda implemented, albeit with some delays. The PRSG series
supported reforms in the procurement system and the Country Procurement Issue Paper identified the
weaknesses in the procurement system and prepared an action plan for the Government. A new
procurement code was introduced in 2005 and a new National Tender Board (NTB) introduced the
principles o f good practice in the public procurement system. However, in general implementation of
procurement reforms have been slow. This has been attributed to a lack o f strong leadership o f the
procurement reform agenda, the lack o f coordination o f all ministries in charge of implementation, and
the absence o f a comprehensive action plan. PSCBP provided local and international experts to work to
improve the procurement code, which was gazetted in April 2007.
64.
Training provided to professionals in P F M and Procurement. The Government, in close
collaboration with the Bank and DfID prepared and adopted an action plan to improve financial
accountability based on the Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP) in 2003 which
identified lack o f human resource capacity in accounting and auditing as a major constraint. Through the
PSCBP a Multi-Donor Trust Fund was established to provide technical assistance and skills building in
line with the PFM action plan. The PSCBP provided training on drugs and health supplies and supported
preparation o f a long term procurement strategy and action plan.
Outcome 4.2: Transparency, Efficiency and Accountability o f the Public Sector Improved

65.
This outcome focused on strengthening the capacity of the public sector in a transparent,
accountable and efficient way, and enhancement o f citizens’ voice to provide good governance and
service provision.

66.
Improved accountability towards citizens. Government institutions were strengthened after
successful adoption o f a new constitution in 2003. The judiciary was separated from the executive and
legislative and the Office of the Prosecutor General and Office o f Ombudsman were created. The
PRSC/G series supported citizens report and community score cards (CSCs) for education and health in
2006 aimed at: (i)improving the dialogue between frontline service providers and users; (ii) promoting
individuals and communities ownership o f evaluation outcomes; and (iii)and broadening citizen
understanding o f policies, strategies and implementation processes.
67.
Public sector reforms implemented. The Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP)
focused on improving the efficiency, transparency and accountability o f the public sector. Initial progress
was slow, but key activities picked up during FY07. The Human Resource and Institutional Capacity
Development Agency (HIDA) was established as a coordinating agency in November 2004 and a MultiSector Capacity Building Program was launched in October 2005. HIDA has now recruited qualified
staff and i s fully operational. Implementation o f public sector reforms has progressed with a functional
review o f six core ministries and a comparative pay study. The Bank provided support to sector
ministries but progress has been slow due to lack of overall strategic engagement by ministries. The
project further facilitated skills audit o f public, private and civil societies which will culminate in the
development o f a national skills development policy. The coordination mechanism o f public sector
reforms remains weak and the Bank through its policy dialogue encouraged the Government to improve
the functioning coordination mechanism across government,

75

68.
Service delivery decentralized from central ministries to district and sector level. The Bank
supported Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP) facilitated the capacity
development o f local governments. The project tripled its geographic coverage since effectiveness and
established a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) for decentralization. When the Territorial Reform Program
in early 2006 consolidated Rwanda’s districts from 106 to 30, it played a key role in financing orientation
programs in all 30 district offices. A l l districts have created five-year development plans and 100 percent
o f the participating districts have completed training in basic financial management, procurement and
M&E. Rwanda’s service delivery has been decentralized and the size of the central administration has
been reduced from 2,000 staff to 500 in 2006. The Bank has been successful in strengthening,
empowering and improving accountability o f local governments to communities through community
development initiative and income generating activities for the poor.
V. Bank Performance
69.
The CAS was implemented under the base case scenario in the range of US$250-$317
million, including about US$lOO million in I D A grants. During FY03-06, 8 out o f 7 operations
planned under the base case scenarios were delivered. The second phase o f Rural Sector Support Project
(RSSP Il)was not delivered as planned instead the Urgent Electricity and Rehabilitation Project (US25
million) was approved. In addition, under the I S N strategy, four more projects were delivered during
FY07 with a total amount o f US$71 million.

70.
The Bank successfully shifted its choice of instruments during the CAS period toward
increased budget support. The Bank has responded flexibly in assisting the Government’s development
needs and moved increasingly towards budget support. As discussed above, the implementation o f the
PRSC/G series has been successful with achievements far exceeding expectations. Bank internally it
succeeded in creating an effective multi-sector team and externally it built foundations for increased
donor harmonization and strengthened cross-sectoral linkages. In addition, investment lending through
demand-driven projects like the Rural Sector Support Project (RTSP), and the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (RWSP) played an important role especially with respect to capacity constraints at the
local level. The Bank also showed flexibility and the in case o f the Urgent Electricity and Power Project
facilitated Board approval within only six months to successfully address the emergency power shortage
situation.

71.
The Bank has delivered more analytical work than planned initially but dissemination has
been limited. Annex 2 shows the broad range of AAA undertaken by the Bank. This increase in AAA
was consistent with the IEG CAE 2004 recommendations that called for more AAA to enhance
development effectiveness. However, the Bank’s work was not always properly aligned with the
operations or sequenced properly. For example, the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) was only
delivered towards the end and-as originally planned-at the beginning o f the CAS period. The CEM
was delayed due to various activities needed to support the move toward budget support. Furthermore,
since many analytic products are informal to respond to shifting government needs, it i s difficult to get an
accurate evaluation o f actual number o f AAA and their impact. However, as the above assessment tried
to show, the Bank’s analytical work i s influential in framing policy dialogue in Rwanda. Going forward,
analytical work should be utilized more effectively to broaden the development dialogue with government
and development partners.
Quality of the Portfolio:

72.
The overall implementation o f the portfolio during the CAS period has been satisfactory (11
projects) with only one project (Public Sector Capacity Building) rated as moderately satisfactory.

76

Among the regional projects affecting Rwanda two projects have been rated as moderately satisfactory
while one project has been rated as satisfactory. However, Rwanda’s portfolio performance58improved
from 4 (out o f 6) percent problems at risk in 2003 to 2.5 percent at risk in 2004. There was one problem
project (Rural Sector Support Project) and one project at risk due to several flags (Emergency
Demobilization and Reintegration Project).
73.
Rwanda’s portfolio improved significantly. The portfolio quality was evaluated in December
2004 and since then considerable focus was given on implementation and improvement o f the quality o f
the portfolio. Several components o f the problem projects were re-designed, which led removal o f
several risk flags. Each project has a country record flag except e-Rwanda and Urgent Electricity and
Rehabilitation (UER) project with currently two flags (effectiveness delay and M&E respectively). On
the overall program, Rwanda’s portfolio has been stable during the CAS period in “realism, “ p r o - a c t i ~ i t y ~ ~
(both at 100 percent) and disbursement ratio (10.8 percent compared to 5.4 percent Africa average). This
reflects accelerated implementation o f projects especially at decentralized levels. The progress i s due to
an improved staffing strategy o f PIUs, close monitoring from the government and the Bank team.

74.
The Quality Assurance Group carried out five QEAs (quality at entry assessments) of
projects in Rwanda.59The findings indicate that in the more recent projects between 2005 and 2007,
exemplary collaboration between external donors, in the private sector led to good outcomes.
Additionally, superior country knowledge o f tasks teams and task managers for preparation and
implementation o f projects, excellent team work o f various Bank units, and strong borrower commitment,
demand-driven design and donor coordination contributed to good results in the projects. The Q A G
panels recommended that the teams put more effort into integration o f environment into Bank
supervision, enhanced monitoring and evaluation o f the impacts o f Bank projects, taking into
consideration o f weak implementation capacity when designing new operations, tailor project design to
individual country capacity, ensure implementation units have minimum staff, and advance procurement
documentation prior to Board approval.

75.
The quality o f procurement and capacity remained one of the major challenges for project
implementation during the CAS period. This was due to: (i)lack o f understanding o f the Bank’s
procurement process ; (ii)limited capacity o f staff in charge o f procurement; (iii)absence o f general
consensus that procurement i s a necessary tool for successful project implementation; and (iv) weak
commitment to improve the overall quality o f procurement practices. A 2006 Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) conducted jointly with the Government recommended that for the long run
the Bank needs to continue building capacity at the technical level and also at the decision makers level.
In addition to procurement issues, difficult administrative procedures and processes resulted in slow
project implementation. This includes delays in appointing key staff, protracted consultant recruitment
and weak financial management capacity. T o ensure sustainable improvement o f the portfolio
performance, a multi-dimensional strategy needs to be agreed on and implemented by the government
itself as well as government institutions and various entities with the financial and technical assistance
from the Bank.
76.
The capacity for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) at the project level has been weak.
Most o f the projects lacked good design o f M&E and did not have effective functioning M&E systems in
place either. This made tracking o f project results and measuring impact difficult. In some cases
indicators at the project level did not match CAS indicators which tended to be focused on outputs rather
than on outcomes. The future CAS needs to address these during the preparation and implementation o f
future lending.
77.
IEG evaluations of IC&: During the CAS period IEG evaluated two ICRs, The Rwanda
Institutional Reform Credit (IRC) and an Agricultural and Rural Market Development (LE). The I R C
received a Moderately Satisfactory Rating from IEG on outcome, and the LIL received a Satisfactory
rating. For lessons learned IEG stated that the objectives (of the IRC) in a post conflict country with
extremely limited human capacity should be realistically limited to what can be accomplished. Reform
agendas should be kept simple, focused on priority areas, and consistent with country capacity. In the
Agriculture LIL, IEG stated that the project showed that in a country like Rwanda it i s possible to develop
a viable, privately operated and sustainable input supply system, under the right set o f policies, incentives
and institutional mechanisms.
Aid Coordination and Harmonization
The Bank worked effectively with i t s development partners. Rwanda i s one o f the pilot
78.
countries for budget support harmonization initiated during the Strategic Partnership o f Africa (SPA)
meeting in 2002. In 2003, the Government and budget support donors (AfDB, DfID, EU, SIDA and the
Bank) signed the Partnership Framework for Harmonization and Alignment o f Budget Support and

78

PRSG-I was the first budget support operation prepared under this framework. This framework has
improved donor coordination, decreased overlap and reduced transaction costs for the Government.

79.
On harmonization, the Bank supported PRSG facilitated the development of a calendar to
align future donor reviews and support with the government’s PRSP and Budget Cycle. Donors and
the Government worked in partnership with the Government on the development o f sector strategies and
MTEF which served as a basis towards SWAP. Bi-annual budget execution review and joint public
financial management review i s institutionalized. A Joint sector review which informs the joint budget
review was established in 2002. The education and health sectors have been active, and the agriculture
and water sector made tremendous progress over 2005 and 2006. The Bank also supported joint
analytical work. The Financial Accountability and Review Action Plan (FARAP) was jointly completed
by DfiD and the World Bank. The Bank used its comparative advantage in the areas o f procurement
reform and prepared the Country Procurement Issue Paper (CPIP) which all the donors endorsed and
shared the final results. The World Bank i s represented in 12 o f the 15 sectors in Rwanda. The World
Bank i s the largest multilateral donor in Rwanda, and plays an important role in the Development Partner
Group. The launch o f the EDPRS has forced the Bank to play a more enhanced and significant role in
additional sectors. Currently the Bank co chairs the Rural Development Cluster, the Energy Sector
Working Group, and the Governance Working Group.
The Role of I F C

80.
The role o f I F C during the CAS period was limited, but has been increasingly growing over
the last few months. IFC provided technical assistance in collaboration with the Bank’s Competitiveness
and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) through the Rwanda Investment Climate Reform advisory
project particularly on commercial law reform, capacity building activities o f REIPA, promoting publicprivate dialogue and supporting the government’s Doing Business (DB) reform action plan. In addition
IFC also provided technical assistance in collaboration with the CEDP project in the area’of privatization,
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the financial and industrial sectors. LFC jointly with the PSD
department o f the Bank and the Development Marketplace has supported the design and implementation
o f a business plan competition in Rwanda, through a collaborative effort with the private sector federation
and the Rwanda Development Bank. IFC i s working closely with IDA in exploring the possibility o f
participation and investment in: (i) Lake Kivu Methane Gas Project; (ii)an expansion of Intraspeed SA
Rwanda Ltd (ISARL), a freight and forwarding company operating in the Great Lakes Region o f Eastern
Africa (US$5 million); (iii)financing to potential investors that may be interested in buying hotels; and
(v) the privatization o f Rwanda Air. However, IFC’s role in the private sector over the last few months
has increased substantially. IFC has provided a portion of its earning to IDA and this i s being provided to
Rwanda for policy-based support to private sector-led economic growth, driven by agriculture, promotion
o f exports, financial sector deepening, and expanded delivery of public services by the private sector.
The Role o f M I G A

81.
MIGA’s effort in Rwanda has complemented the Bank Group’s strategy o f accelerating private
sector-led growth in the country. During the CAS period, MIGA undertook an assessment to assist
Rwanda in creating a national investment and trade promotion capability in consultation with the Bank’s
department and recommendations were made in Rwanda Investment Authority. This led to establishment
of Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency (RIEPA).

VI. Lessons Learned
82.
Rwanda has continued to develop rapidly. Despite many development challenges remain that can
be addressed in the new CAS. As the Bank considers how it can help the country in the next four years it

79

should consider following key lessons going forward:

83.
The Bank needs to adopt a realistic and results oriented approach. While the Bank’s strategy
was aligned with the PRSP, some o f the targets were overly ambitious and not realistic. The future
strategy should focus on results and monitoring o f outcomes that are feasible based on country condition
and availability o f IDA resources. The Bank’s program needs t o become more effective and more
focused through selectivity, better alignment with country policies and institutions and stronger
collaboration with government and other donors on analytical work. The PRSG instrument seems to be
well-suited to achieve these objectives.
84.
Project Design needs to be better aligned on the ground. Capacity building efforts need to be
coupled with efforts that address broader institutional reforms and better coordination among sectors to
underpin successful implementation o f capacity building programs on the ground. Institutional
assessments should pay greater attention to identifying the means to increase the capacity o f central and
local government. Future Bank operations need to explore various means o f working in partnership with
Project Implementation Units (PIU) to strengthen capacity on the ground. The Bank needs to work in a
multi-sector environment to build capacity in order to improve the performance o f the public sector more
efficiently.

85.
Implementation and pace o f reform need to be sequenced o r aligned. The experience during
the CAS period shows that Government’s commitment to reform contributed positively to CAS
outcomes, demonstrating that progress can be made under l o w capacity. However, implementation of
reforms in some sectors was either too quick or slower than expected. This had a mixed impact on
effectiveness o f the overall program. Therefore, the next C A S should focus on reforms that are realistic
which the Bank can influence and the Government can deliver. The urgency with which the reforms
should take place needs to reflect more closely the reality on the ground.

86.
The Bank needs to continue to work closely with development partners in fostering the
harmonization and alignment agenda. During the CAS period, the Bank made significant progress in
donor harmonization through budget support operations, joint budget and sector reviews and joint
analytical work. Thus, the Bank should foster collaborative assistance, both at the country level and in
the sectors and improve the division o f labor among development partners. Comparative advantage and
