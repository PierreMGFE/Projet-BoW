EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Guatemala has made significant headway in consolidating democratic institutions
and laying the foundations for broad-based growth, but challenges remain. In just over a
decade since the country signed the 1996 Peace Accords ending a 36-year civil war, democratic
civilian rule has been consolidated and public institutions strengthened. Important reforms have
been undertaken in the areas o f governance and transparency, improving education and health, as
well as expanding access to foreign markets under regional trade agreements, including D R CAFTA. These achievements, among others, have contributed to accelerating growth and lower
overall poverty rates, which recent measurements have shown to have declined from 56 to 51
percent between 2000 and 2006. Nonetheless, poverty and inequality remain high and social
indicators in health, nutrition, and education are low compared to similar income countries.
Extreme poverty has remained roughly unchanged, with i t s highest concentration in rural and
indigenous areas. Crime and violence are also recognized as serious problems with high
economic and social costs and new challenges have arisen, particularly high food and o i l prices,
the slowdown o f the global economy, which have tempered economic activity and income
growth among the poor.

2.
The administration of Alvaro Colom took office in January 2008 committing to
increase growth and address high poverty and inequality. The vehicle for the
administration’s program i s an ambitious plan that calls for inclusive broad-based growth
through improving productivity and investment and greater social spending for the poorest. The
program also supports expanding fiscal resources to fund priority spending and investment,
deepening governance and transparency reforms, strengthening natural disaster management, and
enhancing linkages to the Central American market in the context o f greater trade openness.
3.
The Bank was an active partner over FY05 to 08 supporting key macroeconomic and
governance benchmarks through three Development Policy Loans and complementary
investment operations. Investment lending supported education, competitiveness, rural
development, judicial reform, and financial management, and analytical and sector work fostered
strong country dialogue to address evolving challenges. The program delivered most o f i t s
expected results and proved relevant to Guatemala’s needs. Notable progress was achieved in
improving transparency and public financial management (PFM) as well as in tax administration,
but less than expected progress was seen in justice reform. Targets in human development and
inclusion were met and progress in competitiveness was significant.

4.
This Country Partnership Strategy (FY09-FY12) builds on prior advances and aims
to provide Guatemala with demand-driven and focused assistance for key development
goals. The program includes lending and flexible analytical and capacity building assistance to
support the country in select areas that reflect the Bank’s comparative advantage. Bank
assistance w i l l focus on three o f the country’s development priorities: (i)Enhancing
Fundamentals (maintaining macroeconomic stability, expanding fiscal space for priority
spending, and improving governance and transparency); (ii)
Promoting Sustainable Growth and
Productivity (improving the investment climate, rural development and productivity, sustainable
energy, and disaster risk management), and (iii)Expanding Opportunities (enhancing
opportunities for vulnerable groups through improving access to, and use of, social programs).
These priorities address the country’s critical development challenges and are based on wide

i

consultations with government and stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society
groups.

5.
Total lending assistance under the CPS may reach US$1.42 billion, of which
US$350-450 million could be channeled through IFC activities. The proposed World Bank
program includes a mix o f Development Policy Lending (DPLs), a natural disaster catastrophic
risk deferred draw-down operation (CAT-DDO), investment lending, and analytical and
technical assistance. Budget support through DPLs focuses on policies for enhancing fiscal and
institutional development, and investment lending includes activities in enhancing rural
productivity, sustainable energy, tourism, and support for targeted social programs. I t i s expected
that operations in energy and tourism w i l l be coordinated between IBRD and IFC. A
Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down operation w i l l provide emergency funds in the event o f
a natural disaster as well as lending for risk mitigation activities. Flexible technical assistance
and analytical work will be aligned with Government priorities, partially financed by the
Government, and executed jointly with local institutions, agencies, and the Government. The
strategy i s results-based, and specifies baseline indicators, expected outcomes and mid-term
milestones for future review and program adjustment. The CPS activities are coordinated with
other donor support and operations o f the IDB in key areas. The IBRD and IFC worked closely
to identify areas where they can exploit synergies and leverage investments

6.
The risks associated with implementation of the CPS are moderate. The most
relevant risk i s the potential for political deadlock that stalls progress on the reforms supported
by the CPS. In particular, reforms to increase tax collections to fund priority spending have
historically been, and continue to be, a contentious political issue. T h i s concern could be
amplified as growth begins to moderate in the context o f the global economic slowdown. The
risk i s minimized by the Government’s consultative approach to reform implementation and the
CPS’s facilitation of dialogue among country stakeholders. Operations are also being
coordinated with budget cycle to increase legislative engagement. Other risks primarily involve
crime and violence, natural disasters and the external environment, including a larger than
expected US. and global deceleration, rising energy and food prices, and lower remittance
growth that may stall progress on poverty reduction. The CPS mitigates these risks through
ongoing analytical work, macro-monitoring and programs, such the Natural Disaster Risk
Mitigation, which are specifically targeted to manage and respond to these vulnerabilities.

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
With a multiethnic population of about 13 million and a per-capita GNI of
US$2,610, Guatemala i s the largest economy in Central America. Although a source
o f cultural strength and rich historical heritage, Guatemala’s ethnic diversity has been
accompanied by conflict and exclusion since colonial times. In the latter half o f the 20th
century, long-standing socio-political and economic tensions sparked a debilitating 36year civil war, which ended in 1996 after protracted negotiations led to the signing o f a
set o f Peace Accords between the Government and guerrilla leaders.
2.
Guatemala has made considerable development progress since the signing of
the Peace Accords in 1996. Particularly, improvements have been made in consolidating
peace and building democratic institutions: civilian rule has been consolidated and
military power sharply curtailed. The process o f consolidating democratic institutions
was strengthened most recently with the peaceful transition to the new Government o f
Alvaro Colom o f the Unidn Nacional de l a Esperanza (UNE) party in January 2008,
following the administration o f Oscar Berger o f the Gran Alianza Nacional (GANA)
party. While UNE won the largest number of congressional seats (51 out o f I%),
the lack
o f a simple majority has made the new administration’s focus on social cohesion and
building strategic alliances particularly relevant. Building a broad consensus i s important
for the successful implementation o f i t s ambitious development plan to promote inclusive
growth and reduce poverty and inequality.
3.
Despite progress on democratic consolidation, poverty and inequality remain
high and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) are low compared to
countries of similar income levels. Poverty declined from 56 to 51 percent between
2000 and 2006, but extreme poverty remained roughly unchanged at about 15 percent.
Extreme poverty i s higher in rural and indigenous areas, where chronic childhood
malnutrition runs as high as 69 percent.
4.
The Colom Administration i s committed to making growth more inclusive
and to addressing high poverty and inequality. The Government i s placing a particular
emphasis on governance, transparency, and social cohesion by improving basic services
for the poor, including in education, healthcare, and nutrition. T h i s strategy has been
applauded in Guatemala as i t attempts to address deep pockets o f poverty, particularly in
rural areas, where recent higher economic growth has not made significant inroads.
Crime and violence are also recognized as serious economic and social problems and new
challenges have arisen, particularly high food and o i l prices and the slowdown o f the
global economy, which have tempered economic activity and income growth among the
poor. The Colom administration i s striving to address immediate and structural
challenges to increasing growth and reducing poverty and has requested Bank support for
key areas o f the country program.

5.

The Guatemala-World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
was prepared in close consultation with the Government and a broad spectrum of
country stakeholders, and emphasizes flexibility and results. The CPS provides
flexibility in lending instruments, financing amounts, and analytical work. The strategy i s
results-based, and specifies baseline indicators, expected outcomes, and midterm

1

milestones to facilitate review and program adjustment (if needed). Assistance from the
World Bank Group (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) i s demand-driven, and aligned with
Guatemala’s growth and poverty reduction strategy.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, AND OUTLOOK
A. Poverty and Inequality

6.
Largely due to Guatemala’s historical legacy, poverty and inequality are
high and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) are low compared to
countries of similar income. According to the 2007 UNDP Human Development
Report, Guatemala ranks among the bottom four positions in Latin America, along with
Bolivia, Haiti, and Guyana, in the overall human development index, including infant
mortality, maternal mortality, adult illiteracy, and net secondary enrollment. Guatemala
also ranks low on social indicators within Central America, according to the World Bank
Development Indicators (see Table 1). Though social indicators remain low, some
improvements were made in recent years, particularly in the overall poverty rate.

Source: World Development indicators 2006.

7.
There were important differences in poverty outcomes by region and socioeconomic groups in recent years. The 2008 World Bank Guatemala Poverty
Assessment indicates that overall poverty fell from 56 to 51 percent between 2000 and
2006, or 0.85 points per year, while extreme poverty remained nearly unchanged at
slightly above 15 percent (see Box 1). M u c h o f the decrease in moderate poverty has
been due to economic growth and the increase in wage remittances, particularly from the
United States, which in recent years rose to over 12 percent o f GDP. Regionally, the
starkest difference i s between the Northeast, where extreme poverty rose by 11 percent,
and the Southeast, where extreme poverty fell by six percent. Regional differences in
labor productivity, a function o f infrastructure, education, and other factors, as well as
climate conditions help explain much o f these differences in poverty outcomes. Poverty

2

and inequality remain concentrated in rural areas (70 percent poverty rate) and among
indigenous groups (56 percent poverty rate). The pace o f improvements in social
indicators in rural areas has been slower than progress country-wide.

Box 1. Findings of the 2008 Guatemala Poverty Assessment
The 2008 Guatemala Poverty Assessment analyzes in detail changes in poverty that have taken place in
Guatemala between 2000 and 2006. This analysis i s made possible by the availability of comparable
household surveys for these two years-representing the first time comparable data sets on poverty have
been available. While s t i l l high compared to rates in most of Latin America, poverty did drop slightly.
This improvement was achieved despite relatively modest growth in per capita GDP of two percentage
points over the six year period and the impact of hurricane Stan in 2005. Dramatic increases in
remittances, which reached even families in the lower quintiles, contributed to the improvement in poverty
levels.
The Poverty Assessment finds that Guatemala’s strong performance in delivering services over the past six
years suggests that further progress can be made to improve what are s t i l l low levels of social indicators.
However, advances will probably require more resources to maintain the same pace of improvement. The
Poverty Assessment outlines additional areas where a concerted effort could be made to address stubbornly
high pockets of extreme poverty. A conditional cash transfer program could be an effective instrument in
this context. Ensuring that the positive effects of poverty reduction policies extend more widely to
indigenous groups and all regions i s an important priority.

8.
Indigenous people suffer from the highest poverty rates and have the lowest
social indicators. According to the 2006 Living Standards Measurement Study
(ENCOVI), the incidence o f poverty for indigenous households i s around 56 percent,
significantly higher than the non-indigenous rate o f 44 percent. The gap in health and
nutrition i s even more worrisome. Chronic malnutrition i s about 69.5 percent for
indigenous children compared to 35.7 percent for non-indigenous children. There are also
differences among various indigenous groups. For example, the Gm’funas and
Sakapultekos have about six years o f schooling, while the Chuj and the Ch’orti’ have less
than two years.
9.
Indigenous women face particular constraints. The 62 percent illiteracy rate
for indigenous women i s extremely high compared to 24 percent for non-indigenous
women, and 43 percent for indigenous men. There i s also evidence that indigenous
women are disadvantaged in the labor market; their labor market participation rate i s
almost half that o f men (Le., 35 percent for indigenous women versus 67 percent for
indigenous men). When indigenous women do participate in the labor force their salaries
tend to be 53 percent less than their indigenous male counterparts, even accounting for
educational background and j o b activity.

10.
Though much remains to be done to improve social indicators for all groups,
Guatemala has shown gains. Recent advances, even if small, suggest that the
Government has been able to improve outcomes. The Gini coefficient dropped slightly
from 0.48 in 2000 to 0.45 in 2006. Many social indicators experienced important
improvements. For example, primary enrollment rates rose from 79.9 to 86.4 percent and
infant mortality rates declined from 39 to 30.6 percent. The 2008 Poverty Assessment
3

benchmarked these rates of change to historical rates of change for all countries globally
over the last 25 years, and Guatemala's performance compares very favorably. Many
improvements in Guatemala were better than 80 percent of all the advances recorded.

11.
Poverty reduction programs are constrained by budget rigidities and low
social spending as percentage of GDP. About 88 percent of the budget i s earmarked b y
law, and social expenditure as a share of GDP i s relatively low (six percent in 2007)
compared to the rest of Latin America.

A 2006 government assessment of progress on the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), undertaken with support of the IDB and the United Nations, shows
steady progress on all goals except for extreme poverty and HIV/AIDS. The
assessment concluded that to reach most of the 2015 goals Guatemala needs to grow
faster and in a more inclusive and sustainable way. Under the best economic growth
scenario, which implies an average growth rate of 5 percent combined with additional
social and redistribution policies costing an estimated 0.6 percent of GDP, the goals on
poverty, hunger, gender and infant mortality could be met. However, reaching literacy
and maternal mortality goals would remain a challenge. Under a more conservative
scenario that assumes an average economic growth rate of three percent and policies
costing 1.1 percent of GDP, only the poverty goal could be achieved. The Bank's C E M
indicates that the economy needs to grow at about 5 percent (2.4 percent per capita)
annually to achieve MDG targets. Relying exclusively on growth to cut poverty by half
by 2015 would require an average annual per capita growth rate of 2.4 percent, a goal that
Guatemala has infrequently achieved.

B. Economic Context, Recent Economic Developments, and Growth Outlook.
B.l Growth and Stability
13.
Though Guatemala has coped with high poverty and inequality, economic
growth has been relatively stable compared to the rest of Latin America. Since
1960, average per capita real GDP growth in Guatemala has averaged about 1.4 percent,
nearly the same as Latin America’s rate as a whole, but the country’s growth volatility
was less than half the regional average.’ M u c h o f Guatemala’s relative stability can be
attributed to prudent macroeconomic policies that have kept inflation and public debt
manageable, while avoiding fiscal imbalances that plagued much o f the region.

14.
Sound macroeconomic management has allowed Guatemala to capitalize on
favorable external conditions in recent years. Despite Guatemala’s susceptibility to
natural disasters (e.g. Hurricane Stan in 2005), financial market volatility (e.g., the
successful resolution o f two commercial banks in 2006-2007), and terms o f trade shocks
(e.g., the coffee crisis in 2003-2004), the economy grew 4.2 percent on average from
2004 to 2007, reaching 5.7 percent in 2007, i t s highest growth in three decades. Reforms
to improve the investment climate and reduce interest rates contributed to accelerating
private consumption and investment. On the external front, high inflows o f wage
remittances and favorable external conditions helped create strong demand for
Guatemala’s exports and a stable balance o f payments.
15.
To accelerate broad-based growth, Guatemala will need to improve the
investment climate for business, increase educational attainment and make progress
on the governance, transparency and security. A challenge in meeting these goals w i l l
be to expand fiscal space to support priority public investment and social spending.
Since the 1996 Peace Accords, Guatemala’s target has been to raise tax revenues to 13.2
percent o f GDP.2 Despite significant improvements in tax administration, including the
passage o f an Anti-Tax Evasion Law in 2006, political opposition and unfavorable
constitutional court rulings on taxes have kept tax collections as a share o f GDP relatively
flat and below the Peace Accords target.3 Guatemala’s light tax burden, which at slightly
over 12 percent i s among the lowest in the region, does not provide sufficient fiscal space
to address social needs.

B.2 Investment Climate, Trade and Finance
16.
Since 2003, Guatemala has achieved substantial progress in improving its
investment climate. According to the Bank’s 2008 Doing Business Report, while
Guatemala s t i l l ranks l o w in the business climate indicators (114* out o f 178 countries,
on par with Costa Rica) i t has improved since 2006 when it ranked 128”. In 2006 and
2007, Guatemala was among the top reformers worldwide in Doing Business indicators,
Volatility measured by the coefficient of variation of annual real GDP growth.

One major result of the Anti-Evasion Law has been the significant reduction on V A T tax evasion from
34.4% in 2004 to 26.1% in 2007, below the L A C average. IMFNB (2008).

5

and perceptions of the business environment have improved substantially. New free trade
agreements have been, or are being, negotiated, including DR-CAFTA, which became
effective in 2006. FDI increased more than threefold since 2004. Guatemala’s sovereign
risk ratings also improved (i.e., S&P’s, BB w/positive outlook; Fitch, BB+ w/stable
outlook; and Moody’s, Ba2 w/positive outlook). Still, challenges remain, and the 2008
Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment highlights corruption, energy supplies and
crime as the greatest obstacles faced b y business (see Box 2).
Box 2. 2008 Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) Findings
The second Investment Climate Assessment for Guatemala was completed in 2008 based on 2007 survey
data and allows for a comparison with 2004 data. The survey interviewed more than 500 firms from the
manufacturing, services and construction sectors.
Since 2003, Guatemala made substantial progress in improving i t s business climate, but there i s room for
improvement, especially compared to i t s competitors. Firms still report corruption as their number one
obstacle, but only 61% of f i r m s did so in 2007 versus 81 percent of firms in 2004. Perceptions of
macroeconomic instability, informal competition, and access to finance also improved. Only electricity,
transport and access to land deteriorated since 2003. In fact, electricity was the second major obstacle in
2007, while perception of crime improved substantially (from 80 to 37 percent). However, crime affects
firms differently depending on their size, region of operation, and exporter status. Small firms suffer the
most, and Guatemala continues to suffer more from crime than comparator countries. As for electricity, the
ICA highlights that access to reliable electricity supply has become a major concern for firms. In the last
three years, the frequency of power outages has increased, and there have been problems satisfying peak
demand.

17.
Initial indications are that DR-CAFTA and other free trade initiatives have
helped to boost trade, but extending these benefits to the poor will require a broadbased development agenda (See Box 3). Since DR-CAFTA came into effect, exports
and imports have grown more rapidly than in previous years, but i t i s s t i l l too early to
determine whether these gains can be attributed solely to the free trade agreement or to
other favorable external demand factors. Global experience suggests that the extra growth
and poverty reduction that Guatemala extracts from i t s free trade initiatives w i l l largely
depend on the efficiency and competitiveness of i t s economy. Competitiveness reflects
many factors, including labor force education and flexibility, reliability of energy
sources, good transportation linkages within the country, port facilities, and the capacity
of the legal and judicial system to enforce contracts and facilitate business activity,
among others.
18.
Financial sector legal and regulatory reforms implemented since 2000 have
improved banks’ solvency and resilience to market volatility, but lack of access to
finance remains a major issue for the financial sector. Domestic credit to the private
sector increased from around 20 percent of GDP in 2000 to 30.1 percent in 2007.
Nevertheless, these figures remain low compared to the Central American average (i.e.,
47 percent) and interest rate spreads are also relatively high. The problem i s especially
serious for smaller firms, whose access to credit i s even more restricted. Currently, a
wide range of mostly non-regulated financial entities service clients that cannot access
the banking system. In this context, a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework

6

would help reduce risk and deepen the development of the financial system. The
implementation of the Movable Guarantees Law, simplified accounting rules and
governance practices for SMEs, a comprehensive credit information system and more
efficient procedures for execution of collateral would improve access to credit for SMEs.
BOX3. DR-CAFTA
The Dominican Republic - Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) became effective in
Guatemala on July 1, 2006. More than providing new incentives, DR-CAFTA offered more permanent
access to the US. market compared to that of the 1993 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Under DRCAFTA, tariffs on about 80 percent of US exports to Central America were eliminated, and the rest will be
phased out over the next decade. US trade barriers also fell, but because most products already entered the
US market under CBI preferences, the effect of their removal was modest.
Though i t i s too early to measure direct trade effects in terms of productivity, job creation, and
contributions to economic growth, preliminary trade data show an estimated 21 percent increase in exports
and a 13 percent increase in imports in 2007 compared to 2006. I t i s unclear whether this i s due to the
impact o f the free trade agreement, per se, or general growth in foreign demand and the domestic economy.
In any case, DR-CAFTA has reinforced a longstanding trend o f growing trade with the United States and
intra-regional trade with Central America.
A simulation model developed by the Bank o f Guatemala suggests that 0.62 points was added to the GDP
in 2006 for the twelve months that DR-CAFTA had been in effect. Another important short term impact

has been a contribution to increased foreign direct investment (FDI), which has been growing since 2002.
Policymakers have high expectations for DR-CAFTA as a means of attracting investment and improving
regional economic integration. Again, a Bank o f Guatemala model suggests that without DR-CAFTA,
foreign direct investment would have been almost 60 percent lower in 2006.
Though the causes are not clear, investment in various sectors of the economy has shifted. Investors seem
to be moving out of muquiZus (clothing manufacturing’s share of new F D I dropped from 52.2 percent in
2005 to 45.6 percent in June of 2007) and other manufacturing and into services such as call centers and
business processing. These changes have labor dislocation effects, with implications for education,
technical training, and infrastructure investments.

B.3 Governance, Transparency, and Security
19.
Despite government efforts in recent years to improve governance and
strengthen institutions, public perceptions of governance remain low. Among World
Bank governance indicators, regulatory quality and voice and accountability showed
some improvement, but the rule of law remains one of the most important challenges as i t
falls well below averages for Latin America and countries with similar income. In an
effort to fight impunity in the country, in 2007 Congress approved the creation of the
International Commission against Impunity. The United Nations Secretary appointed i t s
Commissioner, who has been working in close collaboration with the judicial, legislative
and executive branches, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

20.
Guatemala made steady progress in recent years in transparency. The
implementation of the integrated financial management system (SIAF), which was built
upon a good normative framework and a modem technological platform, contributed to
efficiency in financial transactions and the production of timely, transparent information
on most government finances. Moreover, Guatemala’s Transparency and Anti-comption

7

Agenda i s one of the Government’s main priorities, which i s being led by the Vice
President along with the Minister of Finance, who i s leading efforts on fiscal
transparency. Guatemala was selected as a C-GAC (Country-Governance and AntiCorruption) pilot country, and the Bank i s providing full support to this Agenda. Main CGAC actions include: (i)activities to reduce the risk of corruption and enhance
transparency in the CCT program; (ii)
assessment of the “Internal Audit Function” core
responsibilities of the executive branch; (iii)support to create the Vice Minister of
Finance for Transparency; and (iv) implementation of SEPA, the Sistema de Ejecucidn de
Planes de Adquisiciones. Civil society organizations and the media are also effectively
tapping into publicly available information for monitoring and social auditing public
management.
21.
Violence has risen in recent years, with heightened impact on citizens and
businesses. Crime and violence are now recognized as serious economic and social
problems with severe economic and social costs. High crime rates, including a homicide
rate which has doubled over six years, directly affect human welfare in the short run, and
exert long-run effects on economic growth and social development. Crime and violence
drives away private investment, diverts resources from productive activities to crime
prevention, discourages investment in human capital, and disrupts the functioning of
public and private institutions. This, in turn, generates low public confidence in the
criminal justice system.
22.
Historically, crime reduction efforts have relied heavily on the “criminal
justice” approach, but there are signs that this i s changing. Recent analytical work
done b y the World Bank and others suggest that an improved strategy would be to
combine reforms to enhance the quality of the police and justice systems with targeted
interventions to reduce and prevent crime. Rigorous scientific evaluations have
demonstrated that the most effective anti-crime measures target specific risk factors (e.g.,
access to firearms, drugs and alcohol use, and family violence) and particular types of
violence.
23.
Crime reduction could be achieved in the short-term by targeting high risk
groups, but in the medium- and long-run human development strategies are
indicated. International experience, including in BogotB, Cali, Santiago, Sao Paulo, and
Belo Horizonte, suggests that one of the most effective entry points for crime and
violence prevention i s the municipality. Prevention and control responses are also
complementary, and partnerships between governments and communities are imperative
to realize gains.

B.4 Recent Economic Developments and Growth Outlook
24.
After a period of stable and relative low inflation, inflation in Guatemala has
seen an uptick, driven in large measure by the high prices of food and oil. Year-onyear headline inflation increased from 5.3 percent in mid 2007 to 13.6 percent in
June2008. Perhaps more worrisome, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices)
has tracked closely headline inflation and increased markedly from about 5 percent in
mid 2007 to 12.6 percent in June 2008. Survey-based inflation expectations for end-2008

8

have also been on the rise in recent months. T h i s reversal on the inflation front has been
mainly driven b y the evolution of o i l and international food prices (oil prices increased b y
47 percent and food prices rose by 60 in 2007), and also by domestic demand pressures
(credit to the private sector has been increasing at 23 percent over 2006-2007.
25.
Food price inflation accelerated from slightly below eight percent in mid2007 to 18.9 percent in June 2008. As in other countries, the poor are being hit hard b y
inflation of food prices, given that food tends to represent a larger share of consumption
among the poor (54 percent for those below the poverty line and 37 percent in the CPI
basket). In fact, in June 2008 the effective inflation rate for the Guatemalan poor,
considering a typically consumed basket of goods, was about 1.4 percentage points above
the officially measured inflation rate. The Government i s working to address this
situation through various measures, including lower import duties and taxes on food,
accelerated rural development strategies, and increased payments under a new
conditional cash transfer program, which w i l l partially mitigate the rise in food and
transportation prices.
Guatemala’s external position remained stable over the past few years. The
26.
current account deficit stabilized at five percent o f GDP, and private capital inflows and
remittances permitted the accumulation of international reserves to a comfortable level:
about four months of imports of goods and services. For 2008, the external deficit i s
projected to deteriorate to 5.5 percent of GDP because o f high oil prices, declining
thereafter as non-oil imports moderate and exports and remittances continue growing to
about 5.1 percent at the end of the CPS period.

27.
Guatemala’s fiscal deficit and public debt to GDP are among the lowest in
Latin America. From 2004 to 2007, the deficit o f the Central Government averaged 1.7
percent o f GDP, and public debt of the non-financial public sector remained less than 23
percent of GDP (of which about 13 percent i s external debt). To maintain Guatemala’s
long-run fiscal sustainability and expand programs to address social needs, fiscal
resources w i l l need to grow. Fiscal reform i s thus on the agenda to promote prudent fiscal
management to cover additional planned spending. The proposed reform i s designed to
cover revenue losses (0.7 percent of GDP) associated with next year’s expiration of a
temporary minimum corporate income tax, and provide fiscal space for additional social
spending (see Annex G).
28.
Growth i s slowing to sustainable levels after a robust pace in recent years.
Growth i s expected to moderate to 4.6 percent in 2008 from 5.7 percent in 2007 owing to
sluggish global economic activity, particularly in the United States, less growth in
remittance inflows, and high food and oil prices. Export growth slowed to 16.7 percent in
April 2008 from 26.1 percent in April 2007, and growth in remittances, a major
component of income for the poor, dropped to 8.6 percent in June 2008 from 12.6 percent
in June 2007. Capital inflows have also shown s i g n s of slowing as global financial
markets have experienced greater volatility. In May 2008, the (year on year) index of
economic activity rose 4.4percent, well below the 7.2 percent average increase in 2007.
Inflation i s also expected to moderate during 2009, mainly from stabilization of food and
oil prices and the effects of a monetary tightening policy, which began in mid-2007.

9

29.
The outlook for growth over the new CPS period i s broadly positive.
Through 2012, real GDP growth i s expected to average about 4.5 percent, less than the
rates since 2005, but higher than the rate observed over from 2000-2005. Growth i s
expected to be supported by a recovery in domestic demand and increased trade and
foreign investment under DR-CAFTA, other free trade agreements, and enhanced
regional integration. Domestic and foreign direct investment are expected to rise owing
to greater business confidence, improved transparency and public sector governance,
rural productivity gains, and a rebound in the prices of traditional and non-traditional
exports. Economic growth i s projected to exceed population growth by about two
percent over the medium-term, continuing the trend of positive per capita income gains
since 2004.

C. Environment and Disaster Mitigation
30.
Guatemala i s highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Guatemala i s one o f five
countries in the world most affected by floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, with 40.8
percent o f the population exposed to five or more threats simultaneously. Guatemala’s
vulnerability i s the product o f different factors, including: (i)
urbanization and occupation
highly vulnerable physical structures; and (iii)
limited capacity to
o f at-risk land; (ii)
manage natural disaster risks. As reconfirmed by recent hurricane disasters, natural
disaster management i s imperative.

Environment. Among Guatemala’s main products and sources o f growth are
31.
sugar, bananas, coffee, tourism, forestry and aquaculture. All these products and activities
depend heavily on natural resources. Ensuring sustainable use o f natural capital i s thus
critical to maintaining economic growth. As detailed in the 2007 Country Environmental
Analysis, the poor are disproportionately affected by pollution and natural disasters.
Guatemala took important steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of its
32.
development program through systematic attention to environmental concerns.
Though progress was made on improving the institutional and legal framework for
environmental management, Guatemala s t i l l faces considerable environmental
challenges, including: i)over-exploitation o f water resources; ii)water pollution; iii)
deforestation; iv) soil and land degradation; and v) vulnerability to natural disasters.
Given new economic opportunities under DR-CAFTA and the proposed scaling-up o f
infrastructure investments, the Government needs to accelerate consolidation o f
institutional and organizational responsibilities related to environmental protection. The
Government has also started several activities to address deforestation and improve
environmental quality.
111. WORLD BANK GROUP-GUATEMALA

PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

A. Lessons Learned from the Prior Country Assistance Strategy (FY 05- FYOS)
33.
The CAS was aligned to country needs outlined in the government program
and to broad national priorities highlighted in the Peace Accords. The CAS
maintained continuity with the previous program and focused on emerging priorities. I t s
four pillars were: (i)
strengthening fundamentals; (ii)
promoting social inclusion; (iii)
equitable and sustainable growth; and (iv) environment support. The CAS Completion
Report provides a detailed assessment o f Bank performance during FY05-08 (Annex H).

34.
Progress was achieved across the program, with the strongest performance
in improving transparency and public financial management (PFM). The Bank has
been supporting Guatemala’s efforts in PFM since 1996. All the targets set by the CAS
Progress report were met or surpassed, and outcomes were strong. The recent Public
Expenditure Review (PER) indicates that enhanced budget management capacity
contributed to a more effective use o f public funds. The Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) also showed that greater transparency and competition in

public procurement resulted in fiscal savings from lower prices and better quality. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) identified an increase in the
capacity o f local governments to mobilize revenues and deliver services.
35.
Significant progress was made in macroeconomic management and key
priorities, such as tax administration, but progress was less than desired in justice
reform. The Bank supported the implementation o f a 106-point strategic action plan to
improve tax and customs administration. The implementation o f the plan i s on target, and
a Law against Tax Evasion and Elusion was passed in 2006. These measures helped
authorities reach their revenue target o f 12.1 percent o f GDP, but this was s t i l l below the
13.2 percent target set by the Peace Accords. The objectives set under the CAS for
judicial reform were met, but the development impact o f the related projects was limited.
T h i s can be largely attributed to project design and the lack o f a precise results
framework.
36.
Targets in human development and inclusion were also met. The DPL series
supported increasing the share of the budget-and of GDP-allocated to social
expenditure. Bank assistance focused on improving the capacity o f sector ministries to
design and implement social programs. Progress toward long-term development
outcomes in education was satisfactory. The health and nutrition project just started
executing in 2008. The CAS also helped to increase the connectivity in poor regions
through investments in rural infrastructure services. However, a more integrated approach
i s needed to scale up support, stimulate rural development, and generate more
opportunities.
37.
Finally, progress in promoting competitiveness was notable. The Bank’s
support for improved competitiveness built on the findings o f the Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) and the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), and included
actions to support trade, strengthen property rights and the financial sector, and
streamline regulations to facilitate business. Guatemala’s efforts and reforms were
recognized b y the 2007 and 2008 Doing Business reports, which placed the country
among the top reformers worldwide.
38.
The CAS program was implemented as designed and delivered most of the
intended products. The Bank moved successfully toward programmatic lending. The
DPLs provided program continuity and served as an important channel for dialogue
between authorities and Bank officials. CAS implementation nearly met all o f the
benchmarks set for the high case o f the lending envelope.
Despite progress, governance remains a challenge for Guatemala. Weak rule
39.
o f law and corruption have been perceived as the most important challenges for the
country, while there i s recognition that the Government has advanced in improving
government effectiveness and simplifying regulations to facilitate business.

IFC’s prior support for the private sector (FY05-FY08)
During FYO5-OS, the IFC supported three projects in Guatemala and four
regional projects that are benefiting the country. One of the three committed projects
was in agribusiness. IFC provided a US$20 million loan to the one of Guatemala’s
largest sugar m i l l s employing over 18,000 people in rural areas, as part of a larger credit
package which included US$50 million to the holding company’s operations in
Nicaragua. The second project was in the financial sector. In FY05, IFC provided a

40.

13

US$30 million loan to a large bank to help strengthen i t s capital base and expand
operations. The third project was a sub-sovereign operation with the Municipality o f
Guatemala City to support upgrading o f existing dedicated roads, the renovation o f older
buses, and acquisition o f new ones benefiting 150,000 people.
41.
One of four regional operations was in the retail sector where IFC provided a
US$50 million loan to one of the largest retailers operating across Central America.
The loan i s helping this company expand i t s operations in Guatemala, which it considers
a strategic country. IFC also supported the Latin American Agribusiness Development
Corporation’s (LAAD) operations throughout the L A C region. T h i s corporation provided
eight-year loans averaging US$400,000 to agribusiness SMEs, with about US$16 million
outstanding in Guatemala. I t s clients in Guatemala include socially responsible
companies that provide jobs for women and indigenous people. Another regional project
benefiting Guatemala i s a US$25 million loan to a supply chain manager and integrated
supplier o f raw and semi-processed agricultural commodities, such as coffee, cocoa, and
cotton. The loan i s being used to establish a capital lending program for small-holder
coffee producers in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Mexico. Based on
success to date, the client i s now replicating this project with IFC support in South and
East Asia. The fourth operation was a US$15 million loan to a major regional
transportation and logistics company operating in five countries in Central America and
Mexico. IFC’s support i s helping the company to, among other things, improve i t s crossdocking facility in Guatemala, as well as expand i t s trans-regional services as countries in
the region become even more integrated.

IFC’s total committed portfolio at the end of M a y was US$60.5 million in
42.
three sectors: agriculture, infrastructure and financial markets. Over 50 percent o f IFC’s
own account was in the finance sector, including a US$30 million loan to a leading local
financial institution and an innovative partial credit enhancement for a local bank.
43.
Advisory services and technical assistance played a key and complementary
role along with IFC’s investments. IFC assisted a mining company that i t had
previously supported through a US$45 million loan to enhance the project’s benefits
among local communities. I F C provided technical assistance and funding support for a
community-based environmental monitoring committee through the Oil, Gas, and Mining
Sustainable Community Development Fund. The negotiations resulted in an agreement
whereby the mining company voluntarily forwent an income tax exemption that was
generally available to exporters under Guatemalan law. Another important activity was
the Municipal Scorecard project, whose main goal was to motivate municipalities to
implement and sustain municipal reforms to simplify key bureaucratic procedures and
improve the business climate for the private sector. The scorecard project complemented
and supported IFC municipal simplification projects in L A C .

B. Current World Bank Group Program
44.
Guatemala’s current IBRD portfolio consists of nine projects equaling a
commitment of US$403.7 million. These comprise nine loans in education, health, rural
development, infrastructure and the financial and public sectors (see Table 4). Seven

14

active grants total US12.5 million. Two ongoing loans, Education Quality/Secondary
Education and Land Administration 11, the DPL I11 were approved by the National
Assembly during the first few months o f the Colom administration. The current portfolio
i s highly relevant to country needs and i s consistent with the new Government’s fouryear strategic development plan.

C. Country Partnership Strategy: FY09-FY12
46.
Strategic objectives and areas of engagement. The proposed Country
Partnership Strategy aims to provide Guatemala with demand-driven and focused
assistance to achieve key development goals. The shared strategy between Guatemala and
the World Bank Group includes reducing poverty and inequality by expanding
opportunities for the poor, particularly the most vulnerable, via sustainable and broadbased growth. The proposed CPS w i l l cover four years (i.e., from September 2008 to

15

September 2012) to align the program with Guatemala’s political cycle. A CPS Progress
Report w i l l be presented to the Board two years into implementation (FYll), and CPS
Completion Report w i l l be submitted at the end o f the CPS.

47.
Guatemala made progress in accelerating growth, expanding opportunities,
and improving its business climate, but there remain deep pockets of poverty,
particularly in indigenous and rural areas, that have not fully tapped in to advances.
The Government i s thus focusing renewed attention on mitigating t h i s gap, particularly
through fiscal reform and a conditional cash transfer program to enhance the funding and
provision o f needed social services. The CPS w i l l also assist the Government to confront
key emerging issues, including rising crime and violence, challenges related to the US
and global economic downturn, and increasing food and oil prices.
C.l Government Program and Key Priorities for World Bank Support

,

48.
The Colom administration focused its efforts on increasing growth and
reducing poverty and inequality. The Government plan i s built on eight fundamental
principals (prioritizing the poor, gender equality, investing in children, multiculturalism,
ethics, environmental conservation, citizen participation, and respect for human rights)
that cut across four development themes: (i) Solidarity; (ii)Governance; (iii)
Productivity; and (iv) Regionalism.

16

Box 5. Government Development Themes
I.Solidarity
1. Social Development (includes rural development, education, health and nutrition): Generate
employment, reduce poverty and ensure access to basic infrastructure and services, in keeping
with the Peace Accords Agenda, the Agenda Nacional Compartida (National Shared Agenda) and
the Millennium Development Goals. These objectives are to be reached through an integrated
approach, which includes among others: actions to increase productivity and generate
employment, SME development, and increasing the effectiveness of social spending through a
targeted CCT program.

2.

Municipal Development: Promote democratic principles and processes at the local level by
strengthening the role of the municipality in development and service provision through measures
that facilitate citizen participation at the local level and that increase municipal capacity.

I
I
.
Governance
1. Security and Rule of Law: Consolidate rule of law and provide citizen security. Strengthen
constitutional rights, fight corruption (for example, by providing citizens with the means and
protection needed to denounce corrupt actions), strengthen institutions that provide citizen security
and the penal system, support violence prevention programs, etc.

2.

Democratic Development: Promote the democratic development model by strengthening the role
of the state. Promote a true pluralistic political culture by strengthening representative democracy
and supporting the modernization o f the party system, while increasing decentralization of
political processes. Promote the rights and development of indigenous populations.

3.

Legislative Policy: Enhanced legislative processes to provide security and citizen wellbeing.
Actions under t h i s area include capacity development for Congress, increasing transparency and
informing civil society about legislative activity (especially in the social sphere).

I
I
I
.
Productivity
1. Economic Development: Deepen and enhance conditions for sustainable economic growth that
translate into fair economic development, job creation, higher salaries, and reduced poverty and
inequality. Policies in this area include tourism and SME development, infrastructure, and
agricultural modernization.

2.

Risk Management and Natural Disaster Prevention: Mitigate and reduce human losses and
physical damage originating from risks associated with natural disasters and, thus, create the
conditions for sustainable development. A step to achieve this objective i s the implementation of
an effective Natural Disaster Mitigation and Management Strategy.

IV. Regionalism
1. Regional Integration: Develop a proactive, creative and autonomous foreign policy to position
Guatemala i n a leadership position within the region and promote a joint effort in areas of
common regional interests such as environment, energy, banking, customs and security.

Solidarity

49.

A key focus of the government’s first development theme, solidarity, includes
reducing poverty and inequality through a conditional cash transfer program. The
CCT program targets the most vulnerable by providing cash incentives to poor families to
take advantage o f health and educational opportunities, as well as income to meet basic
needs. InMarch 2008, the Government launched the pilot phase o f the CCT program, Mi

17

Familia Progress, in five municipalities, and the program will be extended to reach 125
cities. The program will deliver about Q l 5 0 a month (Le., $20 U S dollars) to poor
households on the condition that their children regularly attend school and visit health
centers. The program i s expected to cost around US120 million annually. Ensuring
effective implementation, fiscal sustainability and the supply o f related services w i l l be
i t s main challenges. The Government o f Guatemala requested support from the World
Bank and the IDB on the CCT program’s design, including mechanisms to enhance
monitoring, evaluation, and transparency, and support to help address supply side issues
in coordination with the projects in health and education.

50.
To meet priority social spending and investment goals, the Colom
government i s drafting a fiscal reform program during its first months. The fiscal
reform program i s being drafted for Congressional approval in the second semester o f
2008. Recognizing the political factors constraining a deep and far-reaching program,
and the current economic slowdown, authorities are pursuing an important but modest
fiscal reform. The proposed reform aims to expand tax collections fairly and sustainably
by easing tax regulation, strengthening controls, broadening the tax base, and increasing
tax payments. The reform i s targeted to provide additional fiscal resources, offsetting an
expected drop the expiration o f the temporary tax on businesses income (the IETAAP,
which was levied in since 2004). The goal o f the reform i s to raise tax collections to 13.2
percent o f GDP. The Bank expects to support these efforts through a proposed DPL
series and ongoing assistance to the Superintendency o f Tax Administration (SAT). See
Annex G for a description o f the initial plans for the fiscal reform proposal.

Governance

5 1.
The second development theme, governance, focuses on strengthening
institutions and enhancing transparency. The Government i s pursuing several related
activities: a) Congressional approval and implementation o f a freedom o f information act
to enhance public sector transparency; b) the creation o f a specialized office in the
Ministry o f Finance to facilitate access to fiscal information, and guarantee transparent
use o f public resources; c) the immediate inclusion o f special trust funds and extrabudgetary resources into the public budget; and d) the strengthening o f the Comptroller
General office to facilitate processing o f citizen claims and allegations on misuse o f
public funds and fraud cases.
52.
Complementing these efforts are advances on the public financial
management modernizationagenda. Over the past decade, with direct support from the
Bank and other donors, the Government successfully developed the SIAF and the
GUATECOMPRAS e-procurement portal to improve management o f budget and
accounting processes and heighten transparency in public procurement. On the basis o f
this good track record, the Government i s now planning on advancing both reforms by
developing more sophisticated instruments and procedures, and by institutionalizing
advances within public institutions to consolidate good practices.

18

53.
The Colom government supported activities to respond to growing and
immediate concerns about crime and violence. These activities include, among others:
i)increasing the number of security agents and eliminating staff under suspicion o f
corrupt or criminal acts; ii)building more police stations and providing better equipment
and technology to security forces; iii)improving the coordination with the Army to fight
crime, particularly drug related crime; iv) improving the coordination among different
players in the Security and Justice departments; and v) building more and better prisons.
On the prevention side, the Government has started an “open schools” program
supporting after school activities for youth. The program was initiated in four schools in
poor neighborhoods o f the capitol, and it i s expected to be expanded to 10,000 youth at
risk within the first year.
54.

Guatemala’s strategy also envisions crime prevention activities that are likely
to yield gains in the medium to long-run. Attacking the complexity o f crime and
violence requires an integral approach focused not only on improving the quality o f the
police and the criminal justice system, but also on targeting interventions at high-risk
groups and communities. A preventive approach focused on municipal crime prevention
and human development strategies for at risk youth aims to lower the underlying
tendency for criminality in the medium to long run.
F’roductivity

55.
The third development theme, productivity, focuses on growth by stimulating
domestic and foreign investment, supporting tourism and MSMEs, and enhancing
opportunities to export goods and services. To foster rural development, the
Government has created a Rural Development Council, whose mandate i s to promote
productive projects in the 44 poorest municipalities, and execute these projects via a
US$79.8 million budget. The Council comprises a technical council and a governmental
commission and focuses on four areas: i)production and competitiveness; ii)the
environment; iii)agrarian policy; and iv) food security. In agriculture, Guatemala’s Basic
Grains Program was developed to help increase productivity. T h i s program i s financed by
the Agricultural Ministry and Banrural, and provides small farmers with land, a Q2500
loan, a Q800 subsidy for fertilizers and pesticides, and maize seeds suited for
Guatemala’s climate. T h i s program will cover 125 municipalities in the country, and help
farmers most in need.

56.
Complementing these initiatives, the Government plans to increase public
investment in natural disaster mitigation and response. Guatemala i s highly
vulnerable to natural disasters. Guatemala i s one o f the top five countries in the world
most affected by floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, with 40.8 percent o f i t s population
exposed to five or more threats simultaneously. About 92 percent o f i t s GDP i s at risk
from two or more hazard^.^ Vulnerability in Guatemala i s the product o f different
urbanization and occupation o f at-risk land; (ii)
highly vulnerable
factors, including: (i)
physical structures; and (iii)
limited capacity to manage natural disaster risks. Guatemala
initiated an integrated approach to risk management in 2004, when an institutional
Natural Disaster Hotspots, Dilley et al: World Bank, 2005.

19

alliance was formed between CONRED, the agency legally responsible for disaster
prevention and response, and SEGEPLAN, the entity responsible for national planning
and coordination. These two institutions have been working together to tie disaster risk
mitigation to the development planning process.

57.
The new Administration’s efforts have focused on furthering reconstruction
linked to prior natural disasters, and better preparing for emergencies (i.e.,
rehabilitating infrastructure in flood-prone areas, and evacuating at-risk areas). The
Government also intends to validate and update the National Program for Disaster
Mitigation and Response. Finally, the Vice Presidency i s currently discussing with Bank
officials the possible use o f an existing Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery (GFDRR) grant for a Catastrophic Risk Insurance Study.
Regionalism

58.
Under the last theme, regionalism, the new administration i s prioritizing
regional integration to enhance growth prospects under greater trade cooperation
with Central American countries. Policies under this theme also include stronger
environmental policies and increased municipal capacity building to promote effective
local community involvement and planning. Authorities have worked to ensure the longterm sustainability o f the country development program through systematic attention to
environmental concerns. Despite modest institutional and legal improvements, Guatemala
s t i l l faces considerable environmental challenges, including: i)over-exploitation o f water
resources; ii)water pollution; iii)deforestation; iv) soil and land degradation; and v)
vulnerability to natural disasters. Given the new opportunities under DR-CAFTA and the
proposed scaling-up o f infrastructure investments, there i s a need to accelerate
consolidation o f institutional and organizational tasks. The 2006 Guatemala Country
Environmental Assessment indicates the following as core areas for government
attention: planning and application o f environmental policy, environmental regulation;
and coordination with other environmental agencies, ministries, and municipalities. Most
o f these challenges may be realistically met with minor adjustments to the existing
framework o f environmental management.
Priorities for World Bank Group Support

59.
The Government requested Bank financial resources and flexible analytical
and capacity building assistance to support specific policies and programs that
stand to benefit from the Bank’s global experience and comparative advantages. In
particular, the Colom administration requested assistance to address three broad
development priorities: (i)
Enhance Fundamentals; (ii)
Promote Sustainable Growth and
Productivity, and (iii)
Expanding Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups. These areas cut
across the Government’s four development themes. Specific areas o f CPS support under
these three priorities are summarized in Table 6.

60.
This CPS emphasizes partnership, flexibility, and results. The process of
developing this CPS created a strong partnership between the WBG and the government,
and deepened relations with the Congress, private sector and civil society. Enhanced
coordination with the international donor community also contributed to the focus the
CPS. The IBRD and IFC worked closely to identify areas where they can work together
to exploit synergies and leverage each other’s investments. Moreover, this CPS provides
flexibility in lending instruments, financing amounts, and analytical work. The strategy
i s results-based and specifies baseline indicators, expected outcomes and midterm
milestones for review and program adjustment.
61.
The paragraphs below detail the broad objectives and results to which the CPS
w i l l contribute as well as the WBG lending and non-lending program. Annex B1.l
shows the active portfolio and planned CPS program, including the lending envelope for
FY09- 12.

21

62.
Enhance Fundamentals. Under this objective, the CPS program i s focused on
results in two broad areas: (i)promoting macroeconomic stability; and (ii)
enhancing
governance and transparency. Promoting macroeconomic stability will be supported by
maintaining a strong fiscal position (expanding fiscal space to fund priority social
spending and investment), and strengthening financial sector supervision and risk
management. Expected results include an increase in tax collection as a share o f GDP to
the 13.2 percent target, and improved supervision o f financial conglomerates, as
measured by an increase in the number o f financial groups under consolidated
supervision. Enhancing governance and transparency includes support to improve
procurement and integrated public financial management systems, decentralize
monitoring and evaluation systems, promote results based budgeting, and improve access
to information. Expected results include enhanced efficiency and greater public capacity
to monitor and control expenditures.
Lending: Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loans-three
DPLs totaling US$500 million: one each in FY09 ($200 million), F Y l O ($200
million), and FY11 ($100 million). These operations w i l l provide a key mechanism
to support the Government’s policy priorities and CPS objectives in promoting
macroeconomic stability; fiscal reform; governance and transparency; monitoring and
evaluation; and the policy framework for growth and productivity.
Non-Lending: The program w i l l include an assessment o f the financial management
system (PEFA Update), the public procurement system (using the indicators-based
tool jointly developed by the Bank and OECD-DAC) as well as a review o f
government purchasing practices for large volume and high demand goods and
services. The Governance Partnership Facility Trust Fund w i l l further strengthen
institutional accountability and governance, and the WBI will support municipal
capacity building, governance and transparency, and capacity building in
performance based budgeting. Crime prevention activities w i l l be supported through
ongoing country studies and regional analytical work on crime and violence. At the
end o f the CPS period, Policy Notes w i l l be prepared as a tool for informing policy
discussions leading up to and following the 201 1 elections.

63.
Promote Sustainable Growth and Productivity. Under this objective, the CPS
program will focus on results in four areas: (i)improving the investment climate;
(ii)
rural development and productivity; (iii)
sustainable energy; and (iv) natural disaster
risk management. Expected results include, among others, increased foreign and
domestic investment, an increased range o f financial services for rural producers and
households, improved farmers access to markets, sustainable sources of energy, improved
rural telecommunications, and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters.
Lending: Developing Markets for Sustainable Energy, Hydroelectric and
Conservation (FY09, US$65 million from IBRD and potential IBRD/IFC operation).
T h i s program w i l l focus on energy generation and distribution, power system
rehabilitation (including support for the regional power trade), demand-side energy
efficiency measures, and medium term generation options, such as from hydro and
geothermal sources. Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down Operation (CAT-DDO,
FY09, US$SS million). The CAT- DDO would offer Guatemala a rapid source of

22

funds in the event of a major natural disaster, enabling a quick response to address
emergency needs. T h i s would be accompanied by, as discussed earlier, the
implementation of comprehensive disaster mitigation measures. Enhancing
Productivity and Tourism Development (FY11, US$lOO million from IBRD
(IBRD/IFC potential operation). This entails a joint IFC and IBRD project. IFC
would focus on tourism development, while IBRD would support job creation and
increased productivity of MSMEs.
Non-Lending: Analytical and technical assistance work w i l l be undertaken on
environmental matters, such as studying the impact of climate change on land and
water availability, the environmental and social impacts of expanding hydroelectric
energy production, and the economic, social and environmental impacts of biofuel
promotion programs. This work w i l l include: the National Environment Plan for
Sustainable Development (TA), Regional and Country Studies on Energy Market
Sustainability (AAA), and the Disaster Risk Mitigation Plan (TA). In terms of
enhancing productivity and investment climate, the program w i l l include ongoing
WBI capacity building work supporting SME competitiveness through knowledge
sharing, the dissemination of recently completed Guatemala and Central America
Investment Climate Assessments (AAA), and analytical work on enhancing SME
productivity.

64.
Expanding Opportunities for Vulnerable and At-risk Groups. The CPS
increasing effectiveness of the
program w i l l contribute to this objective in four ways: (i)
CCT program by improving institutional and implementation arrangements, including
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; (ii)
expanding access to quality education among
the poor and indigenous; (iii)
improving and expanding access to health and nutrition
services, with a special focus on maternal and child health; and (iv) expanding services
and investments in other areas that w i l l maximize the impact of the CCT program (i.e.,
water and sanitation, rural roads, and electricity). Expected results include, among others,
increased gross completion rates in primary school, increased access to public services (
water& sanitation, electricity, other) and reduced chronic malnutrition among children
younger than 2 years of age.
Lending: Expanding OpportunitiesKCT and Basic Infrastructure (FY 10, US$200
million, and US$20 million for technical assistance for institutional support for the
CCT / Potential IFC support for urban transport in Guatemala City). T h i s operation
w i l l seek to increase effectiveness of the CCT program by improving institutional and
implementation arrangements, including monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and
the supply of services linked to the CCT program (health, nutrition and education
services, as well as complementary services that w i l l maximize the impact of the CCT
program, such as in water and sanitation, rural roads, electricity, etc).
Non-Lending: The 2008 Poverty Assessment and a planned update in 2011 w i l l
provide the analytical basis for these programs, as well as capacity building for
ongoing work on the CCT strategy design. A regional Central America study on
social service delivery w i l l also provide capacity building support.

23

65.
Results Monitoring. The Bank w i l l continue to support results-based
management, including the production o f reliable, timely statistical data, and analysis o f
this data to inform planning and decision-making. This w i l l be done by supporting both
central government agencies and selected line ministries. The Bank will use an
Institutional Development Fund trust fund to support SEGEPLAN's work on
strengthening national poverty monitoring statistics, and will continue to support the
integrated financial management system. Direct support will continue for the Ministry o f
Health, Ministry o f Education and the Conditional Cash Transfer program to strengthen
their capacities to collect and use data for planning and policy-making (in coordination
with National Institute o f Statistics and Census) through the institutional strengthening
components o f Bank-financed loans. Continued support will be provided to strengthen
transparency and access to information. Individual operations will be closely monitored,
and the program w i l l track the specific milestones and outcomes that the CPS i s designed
to support over the next four years (see the CPS Results Matrix, Annex B1.3).

66.
World Bank Group Lending Program. Overall financial assistance from the
World Bank Group could total up to $1.42
billion, o f which U S $ 350-450 million may
come from IFC investments. The program

and the Government o f Guatemala have discussed. At this juncture, IBRD estimates that
i t can support this higher lending program. However, support at this higher level i s a
function o f the Banks currently strong capital position relative to current estimates o f
demand for IBRD loans from other IBRD-eligible countries. T h i s means that in the future
the lending program to Guatemala, as well as to other countries in a similar position to
Guatemala, may need to be adjusted downward to accommodate increases in demand for
IBRD loans relative to IBRD's capital position and overall portfolio credit risks. Finally,
changes in country credit worthiness may also affect the available lending envelope over
time.

24

67.
Joint AAA/TA Program and Capacity Building. Analytical work w i l l be
developed jointly under a research program between the Government and the Bank.
Activities w i l l be flexible and adjusted yearly to meet country demands. The program of
AAA and TA work w i l l be aligned with government priorities, partially financed b y
government, and executed, as much as possible, with government staff and local research
institutions. These features w i l l increase government ownership and the relevance o f the
WBG work, and develop local institutional capacity. Some studies have already been
agreed, such as a national energy market strategy, an SME development program, a
Poverty Assessment update, and an assessment of country fiduciary systems. The SME
productivity research/TA program w i l l focus on integrating and mainstreaming SMEs
into value and export chains, and increasing the poor’s access to business (i.e., promote
social inclusion). Key emphases include use of effective knowledge transfer instruments
to foster downstream linka es and activities to facilitate adoption of quality standards
required for market access! WBI w i l l also continue providing capacity building support
in key areas including: (i)
governance, transparency, security and justice; (ii)
resultsbased public management; and (iii)
investment and SME competitiveness. T h i s support
w i l l be delivered mostly through WBI regional and sub-regional programs in which
Guatemalan participants are invited to join (see Annex E).

68.

Both lending and non-lending activities are summarized in Annex B. 1.1.

69.
Partnerships and Outreach. To harmonize cooperation as agreed upon in the
Paris Declaration, international donors and the government initiated a dialogue to
improve aid coordination and effectiveness through alignment with national plans. To
this end, the Government o f Guatemala and the Grupo de Dialog0 (G-13), which
includes the main bilateral donors as well as the WB, IDB, UN and European Union,
signed a declaration on May 30*. A “map” of international cooperation was devised. The
Bank and IDB have been providing joint technical support to the M i Familia Progresa
social program, and plan to maintain the cooperation and coordination arrangements
used in the past. In the development of this CPS, the IBRD and IFC worked closely to
identify areas where they can best work together to exploit synergies and leverage each
other’s investments. South-South cooperation has been and w i l l be promoted through
sharing of experiences, including visits to successful programs in the region. Significant
examples include conditional cash transfers and fiscal reform (see Annex G). While
Guatemala has not been a significant recipient of trust funds in the past, opportunities to
mobilize relevant trust funds in priority CPS areas w i l l be pursued. (See Annexes B1.l,
B 1.2 and F on Trust Funds).
70.
Consultation process. The proposed CPS program was developed in close
dialogue and collaboration with Guatemalan authorities over six months, and the
development included on-site visits, meetings and reviews of draft documents. The
program comprises the activities requested b y the Government. Formal consultations of
the program were held in Guatemala on July 10 and 15 with a wide range of government
The SME development program will focus on sectors, and will analyze and design effective articulation
instruments (both the light and heavy types) and centers for knowledge and service transfer. Programs such
as exportafacil will be employed to promote MSME exports, and activities will focus special attention on
ensuring availability o f value chains, particularly for small producers. Agribusiness will be a special focus,
given the need to enhance productivity and food security.
25

and non-government organizations. Participants in the consultations were supportive of
the priorities and the approach (see Annex C).
71.
Risks. There are five types of major risks associated with the proposed program:
economic, political, crime and violence, natural disaster risks, and programmatic. Fiscal
sustainability i s relatively robust and entails minimal risk. Guatemala has one o f the
lowest levels of public debt to GDP in Latin America (Le., 22.3 percent in 2007) and a
low and stable fiscal deficit, averaging about 1.5 percent over the last five years. Main
risks include:

Economic: U.S. and global deceleration, rising energy and food prices, slowdown in
foreign investment and lower remittance growth may slow or reverse progress on
poverty reduction. Mitigation: Ongoing macro-monitoring and country dialogue to adjust
program if critical risks emerge. Operations (i.e., programmatic DPL series, CCTs, Energy
Market AAA) are specijically designed to manage and respond to vulnerabilities.
Political: Political deadlock stalls progress on the reforms supported by the CPS. In

particular, reforms to increase tax collections to fund priority spending have
historically been, and continue to be, a contentious political issue. This concern could
be amplified as growth begins to moderate in the context of the global economic
slowdown. Mitigation: The risk is minimized by the Government’s consultative
approach to reform implementation and the CPS’s facilitation of dialogue among
country stakeholders. Operations are also being coordinated with budget cycle to
increase legislative engagement.

Crime and violence: Crime and violence are recognized as serious economic and
social problems with important economic and social costs. High crime rates,
including a homicide rate that has doubled over six years, directly affect human
welfare in the near-term, and exert long-run effects on social development and
economic growth (by having a negative impact on the investment climate).
Mitigation: analytical support to help the government improve its ongoing efsorts to
combat crime and violence. The government is pursuing efsorts to enhance the
quality of its governance and judicial systems as well as reduce risk factors (such as
the lack of economic opportunities, drugs, and family violence).
Natural Disasters: Guatemala i s highly vulnerable to multiple natural disaster

risks-floods, hurricanes and earthquakes-that pose significant threats to economic
growth and poverty reduction efforts. Mitigation: The proposed program supports
government efsorts to update and validate the National Program for Disaster
Mitigation and Response. The CAT-DDO (FY09) will provide contingent financing,
accompanied by implementation of comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures.
I n addition, an FY08 non-lending Technical Assistance program, the Development of
Scientific Information to Promote the Municipal Planning to Reduce Disaster Risks,
has been taken up by Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery grants.
Program Performance: The new CPS includes fewer projects but proposed
operations are larger, integrated, multi-sectoral operations. Multiple country
counterparts and ministries may slow project execution. On the other hand, the new

operations are aligned with the government budget cycle, which may speed project
approval and positively impact disbursement rates. Mitigation: Fewer and more
selective Bank projects will free management resources for improved project
coordination. The Ministry of Finance recognizes execution risks and is taking steps
26

to facilitate coordination across Ministries. A quality implementation team including
fiduciary experts, the Country Manager, an Operations Oficer and a consultant was
established at Country Ofice. CPPR meetings will be held twice a year and meetings
with the government project coordination units will be held every other month.
Guidelines for both meetings are already in place, and a comprehensive training
program on procurement and financial management and individual project
implementation plans was delivered to all project coordination units from May 13 to
16. Other training modules will follow.

Annex B1.2 Summary of the Lending Program FY09-12

Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loans (three DPLs totaling US$500 million over FY09,
FY10, and FY11). These operations would provide a key mechanism to support the Government’s policy priorities in
promoting macroeconomic stability; fiscal reform; governance and transparency; monitoring and evaluation; and the
policy framework for growth and productivity.
Developing Markets for Sustainable Energy, Hydroelectric and Conservation (FYO9, US$65 million from IBRD
(potential IBRDDFC operation). T h i s program will focus on energy generation and distribution, power system
rehabilitation (including support for the regional power trade), demand-side energy efficiency measures, and medium
term generation options, such as from hydro and geothermal sources. This operation may also support an innovative
pilot scheme for energy output and income sharing with rural and indigenous groups. The IBRD will provide technical
assistance and business development. IFC has been advancing work on several potential investments that would
expand the country’s generating capacity with an emphasis on renewable energy.
Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down Operation (CAT-DDO, FY09, US$85 million). The CAT- DDO would
offer Guatemala a rapid source of funds in the event of a major natural disaster, enabling a quick response to address
emergency needs. This would be accompanied by, as discussed earlier, the implementation of comprehensive disaster
mitigation measures.
Expanding Opportunities/CCTand Basic Znfrashcture (FY10, US$200 million, and US$20 million for technical
assistance for institutional support for the CCTPotential IFC support for urban transport in Guatemala City). This
operation will seek to increase effectiveness of the CCT program by improving institutional and implementation
arrangements, including monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and the supply o f services linked to the CCT program
(health, nutrition and education services, as well as complementary services that will maximize the impact o f the CCT
program, such as in water and sanitation, rural roads, electricity, etc). Many o f these activities will support local
initiatives in municipalities through local communities. As a follow-up to i t s first sub-sovereign operation in
Guatemala, IFC may also support a second phase to continue to support the city’s urban transport system, including
the construction o f cycle paths along the southwest corridor of Transmetro, traffic management and lighting
infrastructure; and resurfacing of urban roads.
Enhancing Productivity and Tourism Development (FY11, US$lOO million from IBRD (IBRD/TFC potential
operation). This entails a joint IFC and IBRD project. IFC would focus on tourism development, while IBRD would
support job creation and increased productivity of MSMEs through: (i)
improved access to business development
services and productivity-enhancing technologies and production techniques; (ii)improved access to financial
services; and (iii)
an improved environment for rural investment and improved marketing infrastructure. The program
would benefit from IFC’s Sustainable Value Chain program and would strengthen linkages between producers,
processors and marketing agents to boost non-traditional exports and food products.
Over the CPS period, ZFC will continue to support growth and competitiveness through investments in
energy/infrashcture, access to finance, tourism, agribusiness, manufacturing and value added exports. Guatemala
will benefit from IFC support both at the country and regional levels. IFC will seek opportunities to promote private
sector development with investments and technical assistance in areas where i t has competitive advantages.
Specifically, IFC will seek to support: (i)
country or regional investment opportunities to help strengthen the j n a n c i a l
sector; this may include support for housing finance, building on a donor-funded market study in Guatemala,
Nicaragua and Honduras, and activities to enhance access to finance among underserved groups; (ii)
in coordination
with the Bank, the development o f infrastructure and energy projects to help enhance competitiveness;
(iii)
strengthening the agribusiness sector, particularly in crops where Guatemala has a natural competitive advantage,
such as sugar and palm oil, and capacity to develop co-generation facilities and bio-fuels for internal consumption and
export; (iv) investments and technical assistance in sustainable tourism that focus on Guatemala’s natural advantages,
rich cultural history, and eco-tourism; (v) manufacturing and services, with a particular emphasis on MSMEs; and
(vi) the health and education sectors, through investments and technical assistance for educational institutions and
hospitals. Given the importance of MSME capacity building and the investment climate, IFC will also seek to provide
technical assistance and advisory support to complement, where applicable, the Bank’s AAA.

Annex C: CPS Consultations

On July 10-15, 2008 formal consultations regarding the World Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy for Guatemala were held in Guatemala City. Three separate workshops were conducted,
including representatives o f civil society, think tanks, private sector, Congress, the Government
and mayors. The Bank team was led by Anabela Abreu (Country Manager), and included staff
from each o f the key sectors.
The workshops were realized together with the Ministry o f Finance and centered on a PowerPoint presentation illustrating the proposed areas of intervention and related lending and nonlending activities in support o f the Government’s priorities. Following the presentation, the
meetings were opened for discussion and feedback was collected. The presence o f both Bank and
Government members facilitated productive and frank discussions with the stakeholders, and
enriched the dialogue as questions and comments were replied to jointly.
The following i s a summary o f the views expressed by stakeholders during the sessions (aligned
to the CPS proposed pillars). The groups welcomed the more focused approach and the
prioritization of action, considered that the CPS addresses the short, medium and long term
development goals o f country and fundamentally agreed with the areas o f engagement selected.
They encouraged a results orientation and impact evaluation to maximize the effect of
interventions.

-

Pillar I StrengtheningFundamentals

Participants agreed that institutions need strengthening and emphasized the importance o f
increasing institutional capacity to improve the effectiveness o f public spending. They also noted
that through Country Partnership Strategies, the Bank can play an important role in supporting
the Government in focusing i t s attention on long term policies, as well as immediate actions. In
terms of governance, participants welcomed support to the transparency agenda through the CPS
and the C-GAC and highlighted the importance o f having effective instruments to monitor public
spending, particularly in social sectors. Finally, participants mentioned the need for clear and
predictable laws and regulations to sustain business development and expressed concern about
the security situation.

-

Pillar I1 Sustainable Growth and Productivity

Participants considered rural development a priority to generate shared economic growth and
support infrastructure development and the creation o f a solid base for SMEs to take advantage
o f existing and new market opportunities as key areas. They also encouraged a territorial
approach, and suggested that this be made more explicit if already contemplated.

-

Pillar I11 ExpandingOpportunities

Participants strongly endorsed the integrated approach to rural development, and the local
participation and bottom up approach to planning the activities related to the basic infrastructure.

48

They expressed concerns about the impact of the current unfavorable international context on the
poor, and drew attention to the need for a broad social protection strategy. While welcoming
support for CCTs, they suggested that there i s considerable room for action in this area.

Recommendations
How they are addressed in the CPS
Include a broader discussion of social protection instead During CPS discussions with the government social
protection issues were touched upon. No areas have been
of a limited focus on CCTs
selected for collaboration, but the dialogue i s ongoing.
The CPS includes a section detailing coordination with
Ensure coordination with the IDB
the IDB to maximize impact. Technical teams of both
Banks are working together on the CCT program.
SME development i s an important element of the new
CPS and the Bank team will meet with stakeholders to
develop new ideas and partnership areas.
The existing Rural Development Project includes these
types of activities and they can be expanded. Moreover
the future Enhancing Productivity operation focuses on
these areas.

Greater support for SMEs

Increase rural productivity by linking small farmers to
large retailers. Small producers will need financial
assistance as well as infrastructure development support

49

Annex D: Donor Harmonization
Partnership activities
In a joint effort to harmonize and align cooperation as agreed upon in the Paris Declaration,
international donors and the government initiated a dialogue to improve coordination and
effectiveness o f aid through i t s alignment with national plans. To this end, the Government o f
Guatemala and the Grupo de Dialog0 (G-13), which includes the main bilateral donors as well as
the WB, IDB, UN and EU, signed a declaration on M a y 30t.

The declaration w i l l be made operational through the following measures, among others:
The work o f the Consejo de Cooperacidn Zntemacional, including representatives o f
SEGEPLAN, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry o f Finance, whose mandate i s to
coordinate aid and increase i t s alignment to government priorities (in particular, to those
identified by the Government as areas for international cooperation).
The creation o f three sectoral working groups (education, health, and justicehecurity) and
one cross-cutting working group (coordination o f cooperation) with participation from the
Government and International Donors.
The finalization o f government Sectoral Plans as well as o f the Appropriation,
Harmonization, and Alignment Plans.
The promotion o f country systems and alignment to Government timeframes.
The Bank and IDB have also been jointly providing technical support to the social program “Mi
Familia Progresa,” and plan to maintain the usual cooperation and coordination arrangements
used in the past, Le., financing different activities or in different geographic areas.

South-South cooperation has been and w i l l be promoted through sharing o f experiences
(including visits to successful programs in the region). Significant examples include conditional
cash transfers and fiscal reform.

IBRDDFC. These two institutions have worked closely to identify areas where the two can best
work together to exploit synergies and leverage each other’s investments. The operations are
planned to be prepared and implemented jointly.
GovernmentABRD partnership. Besides the elaboration o f the country partnership strategy,
IBRD has been collaborating with the government on the Transparency and Anti-corruption
Agenda, which i s one o f the Government’s main priorities. The Transparency Agenda i s being
led by the Vice President and the Minister o f Finance, who i s leading efforts on fiscal
transparency. Activities are being funded through the C-GAC, and include: (i)
activities to
reduce the risk o f corruption and enhance transparency in the C C T program; (ii)
assessment o f
support for the
the Internal Audit Function core responsibilities o f the Executive branch; (iii)
creation o f the Vice Minister o f Finance for Transparency; and (iv) implementation o f SEPA

Annex G: Fiscal Reform Proposal

Despite recent improvements in increasing tax collections, Guatemala has not been able to reach
the Peace Accords target of 13.2 percent of GDP. However, to continue with the efforts to reach
and surpass such a target, a new fiscal modernization reform proposal has been developed by the
multi-sectoral Facilitator Group for the Fiscal Dialogue (FGFD).
The draft proposal as of July 2008 includes measures to provide additional tax revenues and
contribute to the strengthening of tax administration as well as to the modernization of the tax
legal framework. The main and specific measures included in the proposal are:

Annex H: C A S Completion Report
Country: Guatemala
Date o f CAS: April 11,2005
Date o f Progress Report: February 14, 2007
Period Covered by the CAS-CR: FY2005 - 2008

I.Introduction
1.
The preparation o f this Completion Report (CR) for the Guatemala’s FY05-FY08 CAS
relied on project operational documentation, Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), AAA
reports, and interviews with country team members. The Completion Report also builds on
findings in the FY07 CAS Progress Report.6
2.
The Completion Report first offers a brief background on developments before the CAS,
focusing on the relevance o f the 1996 Peace Accords. The Report then takes stock of progress on
long-term development objectives, followed by an assessment o f the relevance o f CAS design
and commitments. Most o f the Report focuses on whether expected results were achieved, while
assessing, whenever possible, the extent o f linkages between Bank contributions and country
achievements and development outcomes. Given that several projects closed from FY05 to
FY08, final evaluations o f some projects are also provided in addition to assessments o f these
projects’ relevance to the development agenda. In concluding sections, the Report reviews Bank
performance, provides a summary “stocktaking” o f CAS impacts, and delineates
recommendations for the next strategy.

11. Background
3.
The 1996 Peace Accords continued to be relevant. In December 1996, the Government o f
Guatemala ended 36 years o f internal conflict by signing Peace Accords with an active
insurgency. The talks leading up to this agreement centered on major problems affecting many
Guatemalans: poverty, illiteracy, disease, inequality, exclusion, and human rights violations. The
commitments under the Peace Accords have since driven economic and social policy, and
include improved delivery o f basic services and governance, focusing particularly on j ~ s t i c e . ~
Important goals set under the Accords have remained, such as mobilizing 13.2 percent o f GDP in
tax revenues, and allocating at least six percent o f GDP to social expenditure. The international
community was also a strong supporter o f the peace process, and has monitored i t s progress. The
United Nations established a Mission (MINUGUA) to monitor human rights conditions and
implementation of the agreements. MINUGUA closed in 2004 after a decade o f work, and some

6. The 2002 IEG County Assessment evaluation provided background.
7. The Peace Accords themselves were not legally binding and formal approval of other laws and decrees within
the institutional framework were required to implement the accords. A 1999 referendum to modify the Constitution
on certain aspects of the Accords approved some but not all of the proposals. Some measures, like recognition of
traditional dispute resolution mechanisms, were not approved.

functions passed to the Ombudsman’s Office, but the international community i s s t i l l interested
in the peace process.
The incoming Berger administration (2004-2008) faced uneven implementation of the
4.
Peace Accords. Progress after the Peace Accords during the Arzu administration (1996-1999)
promoted competition, removal of commodity subsidies, privatization (telecoms and electricity)
and increases in social spending. The pace slowed during the Portillo Administration (20002004.) In 2002, MINUGUA reported that despite accomplishments under the Accords, “the
population does not perceive the benefits of peace, aside from ending o f the armed conflict.”*
Though the pace of reform did not accelerate after 2002, a consensus remained that advancing
Peace Accords objectives would enhance the legitimacy of national institutions at home and
abroad.

5.
The Berger administration also faced a diflcult economic situation. Income per capita
had declined since 2000 and the macroeconomic situation in 2003 was tenuous. Guatemala was
just emerging from a financial crisis, and the Supreme Court had stricken revenue measures
intended to buttress the country’s fiscal position. The international community, including the
World Bank, was concerned about the risk of fiscal imbalance and particularly, the implications
for sorely-needed increases in social spending. .
6.
The Berger administration acted quickly to reverse the situation, taking advantage of
favorable external conditions. The Berger administration entered office strongly committed to
comply with the Peace Accords and confront Guatemala’s macroeconomic and growth
challenges. To address fiscal and other concerns, the authorities: a) pushed through a new tax
package which reinstated in revised form the gross corporate income tax which had been stricken
by the court; (b) reduced military allocations and protected social expenditures; and (c) devised a
106-point strategic plan to address revenue challenges. Officials also sharpened their focus on
governance, particularly to improve the transparency of public expenditures and punish corrupt
practices. The Government also took steps to enhance trade (Le., through DR-CAFTA and with
the EU, Taiwan, and Colombia) and competitiveness and generate faster economic growth, with
a view to provide employment and income opportunities for the one of the fastest growing
populations in Latin America. The results from these and subsequent efforts have been highly
positive.

111. Progress towards Long-term Strategic Goals during the CAS Period

7.
The macroeconomic environment improved between 2004 and 2007. Tight fiscal controls
and economic growth maintained total public sector debt at about 22 percent of GDP - one of the
lowest rates in Latin America. International reserves held steady at about four months of
imports. The Government’s track record o f macroeconomic stability, low public and external
debt, a solid commercial debt repayment history, and resumed economic growth supported
continued improvement in the rating of i t s international debt. In the view of the rating agency
Fitch, these strengths have provided a sufficient buffer to deal with adverse shocks and should

continue to do so over i t s rating h o r i z ~ n .Major
~
concerns today are inflation, which reached
13.56 percent in June 2008 (mainly due to higher international inflationary pressures), and a high
current account deficit o f 5 percent o f GDP in 2007.

8.
Economic Growth has resumed. Between 2004 and 2007, the economy grew an average
o f 4.3 percent per year. In 2007, the growth rate was 5.7 percent. The economic recovery was
fueled by higher prices for coffee (Guatemala’s main export), expanding exports,” growing
remittances, l1and higher investment. l2DR-CAFTA and other international agreements helped
expand market opportunities and improve Guatemala’s investment climate. l3 However,
prospects for continued growth are clouded by the possibility o f a downturn in the United States,
which i s the main external market for Guatemalan products and the principal source o f
remittances.
9.
Revived economic growth is beginning to have an impact on poverty.14 In 2006, poverty
affected 5 1 percent o f Guatemalans, slightly lower than 56 percent in 2000. Given that per capita
income declined from 2000 to 2004, poverty reduction during 2000-2006 was likely driven by
rising incomes and remittances since 2004. Extreme poverty remained at around 15 percent from
2000 to 2006. Poverty continues to be high among rural and non-Spanish speaking populations;
seventy percent o f rural Guatemalans live below the poverty line and 25 percent live in extreme
poverty. Guatemala continues to have one o f the highest GIN1 coefficients in Latin America and
worldwide, despite realizing a drop from .48 in 2000 to .45 in 2006.
10.
Human development indicators improved considerably since 2000. The 2008 Poverty
Assessment analyzed the evolution o f key social indicators and determined that gains were rapid
and compare favorably with performance around the globe. Advances were achieved across the
board, including in education, health, and water and sanitation. Nutrition was an e ~ c e p t i 0 n . l ~
Still, the 2008 Poverty Assessment notes that Guatemala continues to lag Latin America in basic
education and health indicators.

Guatemala made strides in governance and achieved higher international rankings
during the CAS period. International financial markets boosted their grades o f Guatemalan paper,
and 2008 Doing Business data shows that Guatemala i s among the fastest reformers in Latin

America and worldwide. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Survey also
reports significant improvement in Guatemala in 2007, particularly in regulatory quality and
political stability. The Reporters without Borders’ Press Freedom Index and the Political Risk
Services International Risk Country Guide also show improvement. However, the Bank’s

Governance Matters indicators from WBI do not show significant improvements from 2000 to
2007. According to 2007 Governance Matters data, Guatemala ranked lower in governance than
El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and Panama, surpassing only Nicaragua. Major continuing
concerns are violence and impunity in justice arising from the threat o f drug trade and the
demobilization o f armed groups.

IV. Results and Contribution
CAS Design and Relevance
12.
The CAS was designed in alignment with the government program: Vamos Guatemala!.
The Bank organized i t s assistance around the government program’s four pillars: fundamentals
Igovernance, citizen security, and macro stability), social solidarity, growth competitiveness and
the environment. The government program in turn addressed the most critical priorities o f the
country, mainly delivering results on the 1996 Peace Accords to help build state legitimacy, and
improving the country’s weak economic competitiveness. Both the government program and the
CAS were relevant to the challenges confronting the country in 2003 and 2004.16
13.
The CAS was amply discussed with the government and stakeholders. The Bank engaged
the government and other stakeholders early in CAS development to take stock o f ongoing
programs and discuss the new strategy. These early discussions improved the CAS design and
set the basis for good implementation.
14.
A critical decision was made to maintain continuity with the previous program while
focusing on emerging priorities. The CAS included 11 projects” and one F S A L from the
existing pipeline, despite slow implementation o f some activities during the previous
administration, including in tax administration, education and competitiveness. The CAS
assumed this risk because the Government reviewed and considered these projects important to
i t s priorities, and expressed a strong commitment to improve their implementation. Several new
projects, including the proposed DPL series, addressed emerging challenges, particularly
concerning competitiveness, fiscal “space,” health and nutrition, and infrastructure. The CAS
also committed to phase out Project Implementation Units (Plus) by executing projects through
government agencies.
The CAS was designed to gradually increase support to Guatemala if implementation
pe$omzance was robust. The architecture o f the CAS reflected the Bank’s uncertainty on the

15.

level o f resources i t could commit given previously deteriorating performance and relationships
with authorities. The CAS separated the base case into high and l o w scenarios and set
benchmarks for each. In addition, the CAS included a high case with benchmarks linked to two
important Peace Accord targets: mobilization o f revenues equal to 13.2 percent o f GDP, and
expenditure o f 6 percent o f GDP on social programs.
16. The 2002 CAE recommendations were in the same direction: (a) preserve macroeconomic stability;
(b) improve the efficiency of public expenditure; (c) invest larger amounts in education, health, electricity and
sanitation; and (d) improve the investment climate with an emphasis on better governance (i.e., rule of law, trade
liberalization, etc.).
17. Not all projects were continued. Two APL series were limited to the first leg: support for the Land Fund and
support for FONPAZ, a social fund.

61

16.
The following sections assess the results delivered with World Bank support, compare
these results against initial CAS expectations, and attempt to identify factors that drove
performance. The Completion Report further assesses the relevance o f the CAS design and,
whenever possible, the relationship between CAS achievements and long-term development
goals. A matrix summarizing the results i s attached as an annex. A concise version o f expected
results, outcomes and program activities i s also included in the text.
Pillar I:Framework

17.
The objective under the first pillar was “to provide a foundation for an accelerated and
inclusive growth path through attention to macroeconomic stability, legal and personal security
and improved governance and public sector management, including the strengthening o f
municipal governments and the decentralization o f administrative responsibility.”
18.
Most results expected from World Bank interventions were achieved. These included: (a)
timely implementation o f the strategic plan to improve tax and customs administration; (b)
expansion o f public financial management to all central government agencies and municipal
governments; (c) greater transparency in procurement; and (d) administrative reform o f the
judiciary as well as expansion o f the court system. Most Bank support to achieve these objectives
came from continued implementation o f three ongoing operations: the Tax Administration TAL,
the Integrated Financial Management project, and the Legal and Judicial Reform project. In
addition, the DPL series focused on supporting and tracking the implementation o f the country
tax strategy, and public expenditure reform. Bank AAA also reviewed advances in financial
management and procurement, and supported the DPL dialogue.
19.
The qualitative assessment is that the Bank program contributed to progress on
Guatemala’s long-term development objectives. The DPL series contributed to macroeconomic
stabilization, and there are indications that activities in public financial management and
procurement are contributing to more effective public expenditure. Bank support in taxation
helped reduce the cost o f private sector compliance, especially in customs, and i s beginning to
boost revenue collection as a percentage o f GDP. The contribution o f the Bank’s judicial work i s
less certain as administrative gains and extended coverage do not seem to have translated into an
improved public perception o f judicial services. An ongoing governance review should help to
define the next stage o f the governance agenda, and enhance the focus on results and demand for
governance.

20.
The macro-dialogue and technical assistance under the DPL series contributed to a
successful stabilization of the economy. Most quantitative objectives set by the CAS Progress
Report were achieved (see footnote for the results)." The Bank contribution in the financial
sector (see third pillar) also helped address macroeconomic stability. Today, documentation for
the World Bank DPL I11 and latest IMF Article I V Report point to a stable and sustainable
macroeconomic situation.'' As noted above, the opinion o f the rating agencies i s that the country
i s positioned to face possible adverse situations emerging in the external markets.
21.

The implementation of the 106-point tax strategic action plan to improve tax and customs
administration is on target. As o f 2007, 96 actions o f the tax strategic plan had been
implemented or were close to implementation. A Tax Administration TAL complemented DPL
support in this area.20 The Tax TAL was completed successfully,21 despite implementation
difficulties during the previous administration, including serious governance issues at S A T
leading to arrests and prosecutions o f some high level administrative staff. Efforts by the
Government, the IMF, and the Bank led to concrete results in customs and taxes, such as:

18. The CPR set as goals for macro-stability: (i) higher sustained per capita growth rates of 1.4-2.5 percent,
fiscal deficits below 2 percent o f GDP for the entire CAS period, compared to
compared to 0.5 percent in 2004; (ii)
1.1 percent in 2004; (iii)
a fiscal debt to GDP ratio below 25 percent (baseline: 21.9 percent of GDP in 2004); (iv)
inflation rates within the target levels of 4.5 percent (+/-1 percent) (baseline 9.2 percent in 2004); and (v) steady
increases in tax revenues. The results were: (i)
GDP per capita growth rates of 0.6 percent in 2005, and 2.5 percent
in 2006 and 3.1 percent in 2007; (ii)
fiscal deficits o f 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007,
respectively; (iii)
fiscal debt to GDP ratios o f 21.8 percent and 22.3 percent in 2006 and 2007, respectively; (iv)
inflation rate of 5.8 percent and 8.8 percent in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
19. The Executive Board o f the IMF concluded the 2008 Article I V consultation on May 19,2008.
20. A key objective under the Peace Accords was to increase tax revenue collection from 9.7 percent o f GDP to
13.2 percent. The Bank support included the Tax Administration TAL, which the Board approved in FY98, and
which became effective in FY99 after congressional authorization to merge the tax with the customs agencies and
provide the resulting institution, SAT, with an independent revenue source equivalent to 2 percent o f revenue
mobilized.
21. The ICR graded outcomes and Bank performance under the project as marginally satisfactory. IEG concurred.
The main drawback identified by the review was the implementation delay. However, the project's performance and
results during this CAS were satisfactory.

2004. Couriers go through in an hour, not a day as in 2004.
Merging taxes and customs throu h SAT (no reversals likely). The agency operates under
modern and automated processes!’
More efficient operation of the agency i s releasing

22.
Reaching revenue targets has proven elusive in Guatemala. Revenue collection as a
proportion of GDP rose from 11.5 percent in 2004 to 12.3 percent in 2007, meeting the target of
the Berger administration -12.1 percent, but falling short of the Peace Accords equivalent target
of 13.2 percent of GDP. 23 Several mitigating factors explain why i t has been elusive. First,
implementation of several trade agreements yielded fiscal losses. Second, as already noted, the
Supreme Court rejected tax policy initiatives with a potential to yield around 2 percent of GDP.
Third, the Tax TAL ICR noted that strong constituencies opposed mobilizing higher revenues.
The work over the last few years represents a watershed in efforts to improve taxation. However,
Guatemala’s low revenue collection continues to limit the capacity o f the Government to
undertake social investments to strengthen legitimacy and ensure competitiveness.

22. Merging tax and custom agencies has traditionally been difficult to carry out successfully and, in several
countries, the process had to be reversed.

64

provided continuous support since 1996 to improve the transparency and efficacy of public
resource management. In 2002, the Bank approved the Integrated Financial Management
Technical Assistance Project 111, which provided most support under this CAS. The assistance
focused on: (a) extending coverage of the financial management systems (SIAF); (b) developing
medium-term budgeting; and (c) improving transparency through procurement reform. More
broadly, the interventions sought to contribute to: (a) a greater transparency in the use of public
monies; (b) a greater alignment between allocations and national priorities; and (c) a more
efficient use of public resources.
The results expected under the CAS (as revised by the CPR) have been achieved or
surpassed. The SIAF, now operating in Central Government, incorporates modern processes and
systems in budgeting, treasury operations, accounting, and human resource management. A

24.

management system complements SIAF by establishing automatic linkages between the core
financial modules and by supporting administrative systems (e.g. procurement and registries of
fixed assets). Through an executive decree (11-2006), social funds, t r u s t funds and NGOs using
public funds are required b y law to use SIAF.24Guatemala’s SIAF i s at the forefront of good
practice in the region.
25.

Transparency in the use of public funds increased through improved allocation of
resources and procurement reform. In 2006, the Government adopted for the first time a resultsbased and multi-annual budgetary approach, and included in i t s budget results-based allocations
for key programs in two pilot ministries - Education and Health. In turn, procurement reforms
included implementation of a locally developed e-procurement program - Guatecompras - now
in place in all central government agencies.25 Guatecompras informs the public about
procurement results; the next step w i l l be to carry out procurement online.
The available evidence points to progress on development objectives. The limited
26.
evidence, such as from the FY06 Public Expenditure Review (PER), has shown that the
government’s enhanced budget management capacity i s contributing to a more effective
utilization of public funds. The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) showed
procurement reforms produced fiscal savings from lower prices and better quality. The Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) found that the capacity of local governments to
mobilize revenues and deliver services has improved.26

27.
Emphasis on public sector reform should continue. An extension of the PFM project
(FY08) seeks to complete the reform agenda, with a focus on: (a) integrating SIAF fully into the
operations of the Ministry o f Finance; (b) developing MTEF b y placing greater reliance on
results; (c) deepening e-procurement to include on-line transactions; (d) developing evaluation
capacity; and (e) supporting the development of comprehensive local government systems. The
involvement of civil society in monitoring results, already takes place through several NGOs and
the training of journalists on tracking public financial information, should help strengthen
sustainability. Forthcoming analytical work could focus on developing a precise understanding
24. This was a 2002 C A E recommendation.
25. E-procurement (Guatecompras) i s now mandatory for all expenditures and fully interfaces with SIAF. At the
end o f 2007, a total of 132 agencies within central government (100 percent), and 318 out of 333 (96 percent)
municipal governments (a 22.5 percent increase compared with December 2005) have implemented the government
e-procurement system on a regular basis.

The CAS focus on strengthening local governments and communities contributed to
progress on national priorities. Before the CAS, Guatemala had taken steps to put in place a
structured system o f inter-governmental fiscal relations allocating ten percent of the budget to
municipalities. Following suit, the Berger administration decided to streamline social funds and
concentrate on strengthening the system o f inter-government fiscal relations, including a focus
on increasing the capacity o f local administration^.^^ Bank support focused on helping extend
SIAF coverage to municipalities. The DPL tracked results. In 2004, no municipality was
operating SIAF. Today, virtually all municipalities are using SIAF-MUNI or SIAFTO
(simplified versions). Reportedly, these efforts have helped mobilize more local resources.
Improving the capacity o f local governments and communities w i l l remain a vital priority to
enhance service delivery. Future analytical work could help identify performance gaps at the
local level and the factors that contribute to effectiveness.28

29.
The International Finance Corporation has been supporting municipal development. The
main goal o f the Municipal Scorecard project was to motivate municipalities to implement and
sustain reforms that simplify key bureaucratic procedures to improve the business climate for the
private sector. In addition, the IFC financed the Municipality o f Guatemala City in i t s efforts to
upgrade existing dedicated roads and to renovate or acquire buses benefiting 150,000 people.

27. The 2002 CAE raised concerns about the performance and sustainability of social funds.
28. Efforts are already under way to build the capacity of local organizations, including preparation and pilot
implementation of participatory municipal development plans in some of the poorest departments in the country.

30.
A perception of impunity had weakened the legitimacy of the state. At the time o f the
Peace Accords, the impunity in civil and criminal law was particularly damaging to the
legitimacy o f formal institutions. A key issue was near absolute void in judicial services outside
the capital city. The Judicial Reform Project approved by the Board in October 1998 and
completed in June 2007 supported the achievement o f the Peace Accords objectives in justice
reform.29 Completing the implementation o f this project remained relevant to the Government’s
agenda.
31.
The objectives set under the CAS, made more precise under the CPR, were achieved.
The legal foundations for judicial professions were made stronger from passage of the Judicial
Career Law, which i s under implementation. Improvements in the administrative operation o f the
judiciary include, most notably, the separate handling o f administrative affairs. Judges no longer
oversee administrative matters. The training capacity o f the justice system increased from 200
trainees in 2004 to 500 in 2007. The coverage o f judicial services was expanded by 20 facilities
around the country from only eight in 2008. Two mobile courts are in operation. The
Ombudsman Office for Indigenous Women (DEMI) has provided counseling to about 7,494
women by the end o f 2007 from 4,363 in 2004.30
32.
There are discrepancies on the impact of Bank assistance on increasing the legitimacy of
the judiciary. The Judicial Reform I C R rated the development outcome and the Bank
29. Other development partners also provided or are providing support to improve the quality of the justice system
in Guatemala, including the IDB, USAID and EU.
30. The project contributed the most to expanding the physical and the human resource capacity of the judiciary.
The judiciary project ICR notes that there are now 365 justices o f the peace as opposed to 229 in 1997, and at least
one located in every municipality. 70 mediation centers also exist and two mobile courtrooms are ready to deploy.
The World Bank directly contributed by constructing six justice of the peace courts in PetCn, one of the least Served
departments, and remodeling 11 others. The World Bank also supported the mobile courtrooms and the construction
of 16 mediation centers in the interior and the central office in Guatemala, as well as the construction o f one
departmental and two regional centers. In addition, the project helped improved the efficacy of judicial services by
supporting reorganization, training, automated case management systems, alternative dispute resolution, and other
initiatives. Reportedly, the reorganization improved a previously chaotic situation, but coordination within the
judiciary remains a challenge.

67

performance moderately unsatisfactory. To the contrary, IEG upgraded both ratings to
moderately satisfactory. Various relevant issues are at the core o f this discrepancy. The I C R
emphasizes that surveys do not report improved perceptions on the availability and quality o f
judicial services; that is, it proposes that the Bank interventions have yet to impact long-term
development outcomes. The I C R emphasizes as well the lack o f sustained monitoring and
evaluation o f the expected outcomes under the project and the vagueness and multiplicity o f
activities anchored on physical works. IEG focuses more on the extension o f coverage, and the
gains in administrative capacity and legislation. In addition, IEG points out, correctly, that Bank
assistance did not focus on criminal law, where the perceived failures o f the judiciary are the
highest. These discrepancies suggest the need to rethink how to continue supporting judicial
reform, including a possible shift toward perceived (demand oriented) needs o f benefi~iaries.~’
Pillar 11: Guate Solidaria!

33.
The objective under the second pillar of the CAS was “supporting investment in social
services and rural infrastructure by increasing budgetary allocations to social services to reach 6
percent o f GDP in 2007 and increasing the efficiency and targeting o f social expenditure through
improved linking o f expenditures to outcomes as part o f the budget process.”
34.

Under this pillar, the Bank sought to focus attention on: (a) service delivery nationwide;
and (b) generation of better opportunities for the poor in rural areas. The DPL series supported

increasing the allocation o f budgetary resources to social sectors, which increased to 6.0 percent
o f GDP in 2007, above 5.6 percent in 2004.32An education project, ongoing at the start o f the
CAS, helped extend primary education and improve quality. The expansion o f SIAF i s proving
an important complement to improving service delivery. Support in the transport sector has
helped improve the rural road network and connections with the rest o f the country in one o f the
poorest and isolated regions. In addition, the Bank supported the preparation o f strategies in
health and nutrition and in rural development, and supporting these sectors through self-standing
operations. However, late effectiveness o f the Health and Nutrition, Local and Rural
Development, and Secondary Education projects delayed achievement o f expected results in
these areas.
Despite progress, extra efsorts are needed to close the substantive gap that remains in
human resource indicators. Addressing this gap promptly will help build legitimacy and
empower the country to compete. I t was already noted that since 2000 Guatemala made rapid
improvements in social indicators, but that the country s t i l l lags i t s peers. Given the limited

35.

mobilization o f public resources, an extra effort to improve the efficiency and equity impact o f
public expenditure i s in order. The objective should be coalescing recent institutional gains
around a service delivery approach that involves the community and tracks progress through
beneficiary surveys and similar instruments.

31. Indeed, the IEG review calls for an assessment to learn whether the several outputs under this project were
translated into desired outcomes.
32. The percentage of resources allocated to the delivery of social services appears low because of the
methodology utilized for the calculation; the IMF methodology yields a percentage more in line with other regional
countries. In Guatemala, about 78 percent of social expenditure goes to education, health and social assistance.

Progress towards the long-term development outcomes in education has been satisfactory
and MDG targets are likely to be met. The coverage o f primary education increased to a net
enrollment rate o f 96 percent in 2007. The quality o f primary education has improved as
measured by declining repetition rates in primary schools and a substantial increase in gross
primary completion - reaching 74 percent in 2007 versus a CAS target o f 53 percent. The
availability o f education in languages other than Spanish has improved. Overall, Guatemala
reduced i t s gap with average L A C education indicators.
The CAS achieved the primary education targets linked to its assistance. Bank support
37.
was channeled through the ongoing Universal Basic Education Project. This project financed
PRONADE, an initiative that transfers resources to communities to hire teachers and organize
primary education delivery. T h i s initiative established 1,500 PRONADE schools and 3,150
teachers were trained over the CAS period. The evidence i s that the education performance
indicators under PRONADE are as least as good (and in some case better) than those in the
“normal” education delivery system. However, the PRONADE initiative has been and continues
to be controversial and “revisions” are likely under the incoming administration. The challenge
w i l l be to incorporate into any new program the lessons from PRONADE on facilitating access
and empowering communities to participate in the education process. Delays on the effectiveness
o f the Education Quality and Secondary Education Project prevent reporting on CAS results
under this project.

The CASfocus on health and nutrition is highly relevant. The decision to start supporting
38.
activities in health and nutrition was highly relevant to Guatemala, whose indicators fall below
middle income countries, particularly in rural areas with high concentrations o f non-Spanish
speaking populations. The Bank helped authorities to prepare a Health and Nutrition Strategy
now under implementation. The Bank also prepared and approved a Health and Nutrition Project
to decrease maternal and child mortality and malnutrition in some o f Guatemala’s poorest areas.
Pending project effectiveness, the World Bank helped establish community-based maternal and
child health and nutrition programs in the 40 poorest municipalities, and strengthened the links

69

between these programs and the formal health system. However, continued delays have
postponed the expected impacts under the projects.

Attention to reducing the isolation of the rural population was and continues to be highly
relevant. The CAS contributed to this objective. The main contributions were in roads,
telecommunication and electricity. Near the end o f the CAS, the World Bank began supporting
the Government’s approach to rural economic development.

40.
Routine maintenance of rural and municipal roads is improving. The FY98 Rural and
Main roads project provided the bulk o f the support.33 The regular maintenance of the rural
municipal road network increased from 24 percent in 2004 to about 37 percent in 2007.
However, IEG comments in the project’s ICR note that strengthening the institutional capacity o f
the Government to administer and maintain rural roads remains at the design stage. The intent to
involve microenterprises in road repair fell behind schedule as it was necessary to divert
resources to address the damages o f Hurricane STAN. In any case, the IEG notes that the
attempt to involve microenterprises in road maintenance may have been premature. However, the
project contributed to connecting the Department o f San Marcos, located within ZONAPAZ, to
national markets, and to improving i t s rural network, leading to reduced transaction costs o f
accessing markets.34 IEG recognizes the good quality o f the executed works, but notes that the
risks concerning sustainability o f development outcomes are high.
41.
The Bank has commenced direct support for rural development. Several World Bank
interventions (Le., in roads, land administration, social funds, education, etc.) have targeted
improvements in the well-being o f the rural poor. These experiences have taught that, despite
noticeable progress, greater efforts are needed to integrate the rural economy into larger markets
33. The project was approved on 12111/97 and completed on 06/30/2007. The operation concluded satisfactorily,
according to the ICR. However, I E G rated the project moderately satisfactory for the reasons noted. Both agreed,
though, on satisfactory Bank performance.

and generate income opportunities. The growth in agriculture continues to lag growth in the rest
of the economy. But, agriculture s t i l l contributes around 12 percent to the national GDP, and
provides the bulk of economic opportunities available to the poor. To address this challenge, the
Government put together a Strategic Agenda for Integrated Rural Development in 2005, and
invited the support of the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. In response, the
World Bank Board approved the “Project to Support the Rural Economic Development
Program” whose interventions w i l l be focused in geographical areas: (a) with a high incidence of
poverty; and (b) where strategic investments can yield quick gains. In the selected areas, the
project finances investments in productive supply chains. Project implementation i s just
commencing and hence results are yet to come.
42.
IFC operations supported development of agro-industry. The IFC loaned US$20 million
to one of the largest sugar m i l l s that employs over 18,000 people in rural areas. The Latin
American Agribusiness Development Corporation (LAAD) channeled around US$16 million to
agribusiness SMEs through operations averaging around US$400,000. Another regional project,
through a supply chain manager and integrated supplier of raw and semi-process agriculture
commodities, i s helping to establish a capital lending program for small-holder coffee producers.
T h i s experience i s being reproduced in South and East Asia.

43.
The WBG is also providing support to rural telecommunications and electricity. A
Strategy for Broadband coverage was approved, and about 15.1 percent o f municipalities (i.e.,
50) have broadband internet connection, up from 12 percent in 2004. The Bank Rural
Development Project w i l l further implement the rural telephony and I C T agenda, with
FONDETEL as the coordinating agency. A MIGA guarantee i s supporting a private sector
company to expand electricity coverage in rural areas.
Pillar 111: Guate Compite!
The objectives under the third pillar focused on improving the competitiveness of the
economy by addressing key bottlenecks. The assistance aimed at: “(a) strengthening property
rights; (b) further strengthening and deepening the financial sector; (c) creating trade
opportunities; (d) improving the business climate; (e) promoting PPI for major infrastructure

44.

projects; (0 facilitating technology and innovation; and (g) supporting the growth of micro, small
and medium enterprises.” An environment of fast population growth - 2.6 percent annually heightened the urgency to compete and grow. Negative per capita Frowth and declining
investment during the previous CAS period were additional concern^.^ The analytical work
identified the following as key constraints: macroeconomic risks that followed the financial
sector crisis in 2001; the slow pace on improving the business environment; limited markets
abroad; poor infrastructure; lagging access to technologies; and crime and corruption. The Bank
program was highly relevant to the removal of these constraints.

45.
The World Bank Group fielded a broad program supportive of competitiveness. Support
for improved competitiveness built on the findings of the Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM) and the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and centered on the Broad-Growth
Development Policy Loans series and a Competitiveness operation. The DPL structured the

71

Bank support for competitiveness. In addition, the World Bank has worked with the Government
on: (a) strengthening the financial sector; (b) building the basis for clear and tradable property
rights (with a focus on real estate); and (c) facilitating the creation of public-private partnerships
to build and maintain infrastructure.
46.
The IFC is also contributing growth and competitiveness by focusing on: (i)
strengthening and deepening the financial sector and helping to promote the financial sector’s
regional integration in Central America; (ii)improving physical infrastructure to enhance
competitiveness; (iii)supporting, via investments and technical assistance, manufacturing
(particularly MSMEs) and value added export sectors; and (iv) helping improve the investment
climate. The CAS also stated that the IFC would continue providing backing for extractive
industry development through a mining project which was fully prepaid in 2006. The FY07
CAS Progress Report reiterated these priorities.
47.
Progress under the different degrees of Bank support was notable. The stabilization of
the financial sector, and prompt attention to address problem banks were two remarkable
achievements. According to various sources, Guatemala has consistently improved i t s
competitiveness ranking in the region and the world. The work on removing barriers to doing
business helped placed Guatemala among the top 20 reformers in the world according to the
2008 Doing Business report. Guatemala had already been one o f the top ten reformers in the
world in 2007. Commercial l i n k s between Guatemala and the global and regional markets are far
stronger now than at the beginning of the CAS period. Efforts to attract foreign investment are
paying off.
48.
The key challenge now is to build on these achievements to generate sustained
competitiveness. A new I C A i s taking stock of progress and identifying precise barriers that need
priority attention. A focus on competitiveness should also take account of the likely weakening
of external markets and their impact on exports and remittances. In addition, i t i s quite important
to link poor regions to emerging economic opportunities to generate income for poverty
reduction. Increasing international prices for foodstuffs should facilitate efforts at fostering rural
development.

Continuedfinancial sector assistance during this CAS was highly relevant. By the time
the Berger administration took power, the process o f addressing the aftermath o f the 2001
financial crisis was underway. The remaining challenges center on: (a) strengthening the
regulation o f the banking sector by removing risks o f unregistered offshore operations and
related lending; (b) deepening the financial sector; and (c) facilitating access among small and
medium enterprises. The Berger administration presented for consideration, and Congress
approved, several initiatives, including the Insurance L a w and the Movable Collateral Law.
However, in 2006 and 2007, difficulties in two commercial banks tested the sturdiness o f the
financial sector.36 The authorities demonstrated their resolve and s k i l l by dealing promptly with
the crisis with the support o f the IMF, IDB and Bank. The I F C support has taken the form o f
direct lending to one bank to help i t strengthen i t s capital base and extend i t s operations. The I F C
also increased direct and indirect lending to the productive sectors.

50.
The Bank helped address the banking crises and strengthen the quality of regulation in
the banking sector. The 2000 Financial Sector Adjustment Program (FSAP) provided a
framework that guided the design o f a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL); the third leg
o f this operation helped the Government to address the 2006/2007 crisis. A parallel technical
assistance operation (FTAL) aided implementation of the policy agenda. The ICR for the F S A L
rates the overall outcome as satisfactory and highlights: (a) the adoption o f a modem financial
sector legal and regulatory framework; (b) the strengthening o f banking supervision; and (c) the
implementation o f a new bank resolution mechanism that does not involve the bailout o f failed
banks or the compensation o f depositors by the Go~ernrnent.~’The resources o f the F S A L
supported the creation o f the bank resolution mechanism. The I C R rates the Bank performance
as highly satisfactory. KEG confirmed these ratings.

5 1.
The main CAS objectives were achieved. Risk-based supervision, practically non-existent
in 2003, i s in place and efforts to improve supervision o f financial conglomerates are ongoing.
The financial payments system i s much improved.38However, approval o f additional legislation
to increase access to finance for small and medium enterprises i s pending. In addition, the crisis
during the CAS distracted from what could have been greater attention to the non-banking
financial sector. The FSAP Update (March 2007) comments positively on the progress on
stabilizing the financial sector and identifies future priorities. In particular, i t notes the challenges
concerning regulation o f financial groups, given the inadequacy o f existing legislation on
conglomerates. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s review o f credit in Guatemala calls for
continued vigilance in the financial sector.

36. The authorities found BANCAFE, the fourth largest bank, non-compliant with legally established prudential
norms, mainly due to difficulties in an offshore bank. BANCO DEL COMERCIO also faced problems arising from
an undisclosed affiliate.
37. The FSAL contributed to the implementation of this mechanism by funding FOPA and FFCB with the
Quetzals equivalent of the loan proceeds.
38. An operational electronic clearing system for banks and a new settlement system in real time have been in
place since January 2006. Since November 2006, the main systems of the Central Bank for clearance and settlement
of money and foreign exchange transactions are operating under t h i s system; since December 2006, the stock
exchange i s operating under the system as well.

Guatemala made extraordinary progress on opening global and regional markets. In
2004, Guatemala had trade agreements with only Mexico and Chile. The Guatemalan Congress
ratified the US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in March 2005. In
June 2006, Congress approved changes to Guatemalan laws following additional negotiations
requested by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The Treaty became effective
July, 1 2006. Other trade agreements were approved with Taiwan, Belize and Colombia.
Negotiations are underway with Panama, Canada, EU and CARICON.
Countries in Central America have grown more integrated. The focus on regional
53.
integration has led to harmonization of 95 percent of customs duties. In addition, Guatemala,
Honduras and El Salvador utilize identical customs forms. A scheme to eliminate customs
inspections at the national borders for goods cleared through specified Central American border
entry points i s in operation.
The Bank supported these achievements through analytical work, the DPL series and the
Tax and the Competitiveness projects. The Tax TAL was critical to customs achievements,

54.

which have been documented. The D P L served as a framework for dialogue and technical
assistance. Analytical work under the DPL supported dialogue with authorities and informed the
public on the benefits and costs of integrating with the global economy. The Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIA) (2005-2006) concluded that DR-CAFTA could have a net positive
impact on the poor. The extent of the benefit would depend, however, on the capacity of the poor
to link with new trade opportunities. This underlies the Government’s focus and Bank assistance
to help link rural SME entrepreneurs to broader markets through associations, as well to help
create alternative sources of income in rural areas.

Poor registration and titling of property limits business opportunities, especially for the
poor. Guatemala lacked a modem system of registration and titling to protect property rights and
property transfer. The legal system was incomplete and did not provide appropriate conflict
resolution mechanisms. The CAS goal to improve the institutions guaranteeing real estate
property rights was highly relevant. First, the CAS sought to help establish a legal and
institutional framework to integrate the cadastre and registry functions for rural and urban land.
Second, the CAS provided assistance to advance land registration, starting in some of the poorest
areas of the country.
56.
A modem system of real estate registration was developed during CAS implementation.
The approval of the Cadastre Law in 2005 set the legal basis for a modern registration system.
Subsequent work seeks to link the databases of the Registro de Information Catastral to the
General Property Registry. The cadastral survey has covered about 37 percent of Guatemala,
over double the 15 percent in 2005. Most work has been undertaken in one of the poorest
regions of the country - El Peten - with support of the first leg of the Land Administration APL,
whose aim i s to help register and title real estate property in Guatemala. The ICR refers to expost surveys that show sustained increases in the price of registered and titled land. Delays in
completing the first leg of the APL and starting work on the second leg, which just became
effective, has led to postponing the CAS goal (i.e., registering 50 percent of the real estate in the
country by 2008) until the end of the second leg of the Land Administration APL.
57.
The extent of institutional progress was controversial. The ICR for the first leg of the
APL rated project results and the Bank performance marginally satisfactory; however, IEG
downgraded both ratings to moderately unsatisfactory. The points of contention include the
implementation delay and the lack of sturdiness and completeness of on-the-ground institutions.
More specifically, the legal framework for titling remains weak,39 and titling and registration
institutions remain un-integrated. In the future, the effectiveness of titling and registration w i l l
require operational coordination between registration and titling institutions, which bear some
risk. The implementation of the remaining APL program w i l l have to respond to these
challenges.

39. There are no clear rules on how to proceed when there are “vacuums” in the quality of land claims. This has
contributed to delays in titling. A Land Regularization Law i s needed.

75

58.
The CAS correctly discontinued a Land Fund APL. As a complement to the Land
Administration Project, the Bank fielded a Land Fund APL to support implementation o f the
1999 Land Fund L a w through FONTIERRAS, an autonomous agency prone to capture by
special interests. The Land Fund bought land with budget resources and sold i t to families,
while the Bank project provided technical assistance to beneficiaries and their communities. The
targets of the first leg o f the APL were a~hieved;~’however, the CAS discontinued the APL
series. The ICR notes difficulties with FONTIERRAS that prevented implementation o f the best
policies.42 Therefore, the decision to discontinue the APL appears correct.

Guatemala posted major improvements in the quality of the business environment with
CAS support. Doing Business 2008 ranks Guatemala among the top 20 reformers in world. The
World Economic Forum likewise notes improvements. These achievements result from
simplifying customs regulations; reducing red tape for opening businesses; strengthening
national systems for manufacturing standards and quality; and promoting e-commerce. A onestop-shop i s in place to apply for com any, tax and social security registration; a temporary
registration becomes final after 25 days!
The expected outcomes under the CAS were achieved

40. The Land Fund APL was approved on 01/07/99 and completed in 06/30/2005, two and a half years after
original closing date.
41. In fact, the targets regarding beneficiaries and their communities were surpassed. The ICR rates the project’s
outcome as satisfactory.
42. Basically, the policy o f purchasing land to distribute increases land prices unless complementary policies (like
land taxation) are in place to increase supply. This was not possible to carry out under FONTIERRAS.
43. A “one-stop-shop” for business start-ups has been established. According to DB2008 it takes 26 days to
register a business -- a reduction of 42 percent. The number of days to register a property decreased to 30 -- a 57
percent reduction. This i s the easiest property registration in L A C according to DB2007. According to DB2008, i t
takes 19 and 18 days for exports and imports, respectively (reductions o f 5 percent and 50 percent). Times and costs
in customs offices have been reduced through the implementation o f i)electronic customs manifest in all ports and
airports; ii)a 2417 air express office at Aurora Airport; and iii)one-stop offices at border crossings. Discretionary

I n addition, the Bank program is successfully supporting efforts to increase the flow of
FDI. The Government created the Office o f the Presidential Commissioner for the Promotion o f
National Competitiveness (PRONACOM) as part o f the Central America Network o f
government competitiveness agencies, with the view to compete in the DR-CAFTA world. The
Competiveness Enhancement project supported this effort, and, jointly with the MIGA, i s
assisting the newly created agency, Invest in Guatemala, to foster foreign direct investment. The
combination o f improved access to external markets, and more stable macro and the
administrative efforts are contributing to the noted increases in FDI.
61.

Efsorts to engage the private sector in building, financing and operating public
infrastructure were highly relevant in Guatemala. A tight fiscal space traditionally curtailed the
capacity o f the central government to advance ambitious infrastructure agendas. However, the
country had no experience with Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure through 2003.
T h i s justifies the relevance o f the government strategy to involve the private sector. Relevant
progress, with DPL support, included approval o f two laws to launch activities linking the
northern and Pacific corridors, and a partial metropolitan beltway. However, Congress has yet to
approve a PPP Framework L a w in infrastructure. Approval o f one such law would facilitate
advancing an infrastructure agenda compatible with the needs o f the growing economy. As
noted, the IFC assisted Guatemala City in improving local transportation services.

The Bank is providing embryonic support to help small and medium enterprises to
compete. The Competitiveness Enhancement Project supported pilot initiatives in diffusing
technology and strengthening small and medium enterprises. The lessons from these pilots w i l l
enable future efforts to help small and medium enterprises integrate into broader markets. As the
PSIA on trade pointed out, linking to markets will facilitate the trade agreements’ positive
impact on economic opportunities available to the poor. T o address Guatemala’s technology and
innovation gap, the Presidential Commissioner for Science and Technology i s attempting to link
universities to enterprises and reform the national training system. In addition, the Government
asked the Council o f Science and Technology to shift i t s emphasis towards small and medium
enterprises. A broad agenda remains in this area.

Pillar IV: Guate Verde!

63.
The fourth pillarproposed helping ensure “the long-term sustainability o f the country’s
development program through: (a) incorporating environmental concerns into sector policies and
strategies; (b) improved coordination between the Ministry o f the Environment and Natural
Resources and regional and local agencies; and (c) building the capacity o f municipalities to
ensure the effectiveness o f the Environment Management System.”
64.
The environment agenda was reprogrammed jointly with authorities. The basic idea o f
the CAS was for the Bank to support implementation o f the Environmental Protection and
Improvement Law, which defines a national system for protection o f natural resources at national
and local levels. To streamline CAS implementation, the parties postponed the environment
program44and focused on AAA and WBI activities. A 2006 Country Environmental Analysis is,
for example, addressing the environmental aspects o f trade and infrastructure expansion. This
report identifies Guatemala’s multiple environmental challenges, and examines the compatibility
o f an aggressive competitiveness strategy with the preservation o f habitat and cultural heritage.
The WBI i s customizing an existing environmental module for a municipal management-training
program. The original objective o f imbedding environmental concerns into municipalities w i l l be
further developed by the Rural Development Project, which just became effective. It i s too early
to report on results.

Correspondingly, the CAS Progress report streamlined the results matrix.

monitoring committee through the Oil, Gas, and Mining Sustainable Community Development
Fund. In addition, the mining company released i t s income tax exemption available to exporters
under Guatemalan law.

The delivery of investment projects followed the program outlined in the CAS and
updated by the CAS Progress Report. Table 2 in the Appendix compares planned lending and

actual deliveries and indicates that most programmed projects were or w i l l be delivered. Delivery
i s on target with some minor changes, which include separating a proposed governance project
into an approved PFM supplement, and possible continuation o f the Judicial Reform project.
Second, the CPR, at the request o f the Government, replaced the proposed infrastructure
guarantee with a housing operation.

67.
The move towards programmatic lending proved successful. The implementation o f the
programmatic lending series (three operations) contributed towards many CAS outcomes. First,
these operations helped maintain continuous country dialogue and provided technical support
around key priorities. Second, as part o f DPL activities, the Bank informed the international
community on progress on stabilizing the economy and Peace Accords goals that remain areas o f
international interest. Third, the DPL helped maintain the pace o f reform, which might otherwise
have proceeded at a slower pace. Lastly, the DPL dialogue served as a conduit to provide
government feedback from the international community.
68.

The Implementation Completion Reports ranked jive of seven investment projects
completed during this CAS period as satisfactory (see Table 1). The satisfactory (i.e., fully and
moderately satisfactory) projects include: Rural and M a i n Roads, the Land Fund, Tax

Administration, Land Administration, and Financial Sector Reform. The Judicial Reform and
Reconstruction and Local Development projects received unsatisfactory ratings. PEG upgraded
the Judicial Reform project to satisfactory, downgraded the Land Administration project to
moderately unsatisfactory and the Rural and M a i n Roads to moderately satisfactory. Delays in
project implementation were major factors impairing results, and hence ratings. In addition,
discrepancies with IEG centered on sustainability o f institutional reform (land administration and
roads) and the long-term development impact (judicial.)

69.
Delivery of the AAA program supported dialogue with the Government as well as project
design, especially the DPL. Table 3 in the Appendix compares planned AAA with actual
deliveries. The CAS and i t s design benefited from a package o f analytical work that had been
underway: a Poverty Assessment, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), a Public
Expenditure Review (PER), and Investment Climate Assessment (ICA). During CAS
implementation, a Country Fiduciary Assessment and a Country Procurement Review took stock
o f progress in building modern public expenditure and procurement systems. In addition, the

79

World Bank supported the competitiveness agenda with just-in-time advice related to global
experience on trade agreements, and evaluations o f trade agreements’ potential impacts on
poverty and the environment. The FSAP update evaluated progress in the financial sector against
benchmarks set in 2000. Ongoing work focuses on governance, poverty, the social sectors and
the investment climate. T h i s analytical work i s helping to take stock o f the progress during the
CAS, and provides a foundation for the next program. With hindsight, early analytical work on
justice and greater attention to impact evaluations would have helped greatly improve
performance.
70.
The CAS appropriately identifed the risks related to program implementation and the
partners addressed them ~ d e q u a t e l y First,
. ~ ~ the authorities targeted only a limited number o f
focused legislative priorities and initiatives to facilitate a productive dialogue with Congress, in
which the governing party had lost i t s majority early during CAS implementation. Second, the
Government maintained broad consultations with civil society and the private sector to
strengthen constituent support o f key components o f the program. T h i s approach was particularly
important in Guatemala where implementation o f projects and initiatives often requires more
than one administration, and where some initiatives are controversial. Third, the authorities
demonstrated enhanced institutional capacity b y timely and effectively addressing the
consequences o f the two banks that failed in 2007.
7 1.
During FY0.5-08, I F C committed three operations supporting Guatemala. First, I F C
provided a US$20 million loan to the one o f the largest sugar m i l l s in Guatemala that employs
over 18,000 people in rural areas. T h i s loan was part of a larger credit package which included
US$50 million to the holding’s operations in Nicaragua. In the financial sector, I F C provided in
FY05 a US$30 million loan to a large bank to help i t strengthen i t s capital base and expand
operations. As noted already, the I F C financed the Municipality o f Guatemala City to upgrade
existing dedicated roads.
72.
Four IFC regional operations are having an impact in Guatemala. First, the I F C
provided a US$50 million loan to one o f the largest retailers operating across Central America to
help expand i t s networking operations in Guatemala, which the retailer considers a strategic
country. Second, I F C supported the Latin American Agribusiness Development Corporation,
which provided eight-year loans averaging US$400,000 to agribusiness SMEs throughout Latin
America, with about US$16 million outstanding in Guatemala. I t s clients in Guatemala include
socially responsible companies that provide jobs for women and indigenous people. Third, a
US$25 million loan to a supply chain manager and integrated supplier o f raw and semi-processed
agricultural commodities i s helping to establish a capital lending program for small-holder coffee
producers in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Mexico. The IFC i s replicating
the approach in South and East Asia. Lastly, a US$15 million operation with a major regional
transportation and logistics company operating in five countries in Central America and Mexico

45. The CAS and the CAS Progress Report identified several risks to the program:
(i)
Potential gridlock given a divided Congress and the 2007 presidential and congressional elections;
(ii)
Societal tensions linked to political events and controversial investments, such as in extractive industries and
land administration;
(iii)
Natural disasters (seismic events, hurricanes etc.) to which the country i s prone; and,
(iv) Macroeconomic risks deriving principally from remaining financial sector vulnerabilities and the external
environment.

73.
The I F C maintains a modest investment portfolio in Guatemala. The IFC’s committed
portfolio at end-FY08 totaled US$76.5 million in six projects. Consistent with IFC’s regional
priorities in Central America, financial markets accounted for 39 percent of the portfolio,
infrastructure 28 percent and agribusiness for 26 percent.

to FY08, the Bank committed US$541.3 million dollars, and more than half of this was for three
DPL operation^.^^ Disbursements reached US$435 million; the third DPL was ratified by
Congress, but has not yet disbursed. The bulk of the disbursements under investment projects
(i.e., US$235 million) came from ongoing operations at the start of the CAS period.
Portfolio pe formance improved during CAS implementation, but deteriorated in 2008
75.
due to new projects and the Government transition. The disbursement ratio rose from 10.6
percent in FY05 to 22.9 in FY07. In FY08, the disbursement ratio dropped below 10 percent. In

addition, 30 percent of the portfolio represents “problem projects” and 80 percent of the portfolio
i s “at risk.” This deterioration results partially from long lead times in ushering new projects into
implementation and disbursement, and the time lag required to solidify cooperation with the new
administration. The number of projects under implementation was steady: 11 at the launch of the
CAS, and ten at the end. However, this means that the original goal of significantly reducing the
number of projects was not met.
76.
As promised, the Bank moved to eliminate separate and project specific PIUs. None of
the projects approved after 2003 has a separate and independent PIU.

Factors that contributed to project implementation delays:

Congressional ratification of projects customarily takes over a year. The r i s k s of delay
increase when projects require presentation and approval of laws in Congress.
Projects with long implementation cycles are vulnerable to instability between shorter fouryear, policy cycles and to high political fragmentation. For this CAS, early and productive
dialogue during CAS preparation emphasized support for the ongoing portfolio and helped to
improve project implementation.
Guatemala’s low public revenues and tight fiscal policy means limited space for public
investment. When development partners have excess funds, rationing across projects can
lower allocation effectiveness, especially for non-prioritized investments. Delays then arise
in project implementation. The DPL partly addresses this concern by directly financing the
government investment program.

46. The CAS had foreseen commitments under the base case of US$660 million.
47. The time between Board approval and effectiveness can easily exceed one year, and even reach a year and a
half. Budget support operations take the less time.

Aid Coordination

78.
The World Bank promoted harmonization of development assistance. In education and
rural development, World Bank projects helped achieve “S WAp-like” collaboration among
development partners. The Rural Economic Development Program brought the World Bank, the
IDB, Sweden and U S A I D around a joint strategy. O n the other hand, coordination in justice was
not as effective, partly because the Bank focused on civil matters, not criminal matters like other
development partners. The Government and donors also recently moved to explore options for
joint dialogue and eventual assistance on budgetary support, starting in education and health.

VI. Summary Evaluation of Effectiveness
79.

The CAS design was relevant to Guatemala’s needs as outlined in the government
program and the broad national priority to deliver on the Peace Accords agenda. CAS
implementation generally followed i t s design, as most major intended products were delivered.

The CAS design and implementation were also catalyzed by productive and effective dialogue
with the authorities. Moreover, the Bank provided technical support and assisted the Government
in presenting policy rationales to internal audiences, and in informing the international
community on Guatemala’s progress. The Government and the Bank dealt promptly and
effectively with unexpected developments, such as the serious banking problems o f 2006 and
2007. Initial efforts were also made to work jointly with other development partners. Most
importantly, the working relationship between the Bank and the authorities substantially changed
for the best during t h i s CAS period.

80.
The CAS delivered on the bulk of expected results from Bank interventions. Further, the
CAS substantially contributed to the most critical priorities, and in some cases the actual results
exceeded the planned results under the CAS.
Major contributions were made, including in stabilizing the macroeconomic framework,
improving the soundness o f the financial sector, enhancing the business climate, and
expanding access to international markets. These gains in turn facilitated economic recovery
and set the basis for a more competitive Guatemala. Assistance to address the financial
crisis was timely and effective.
CAS work in public financial management and taxation stands out as good regional practice
and i s beginning to yield results on the ground. There have been noted improvements in the
ease o f businesses to comply with taxes and customs, and the tax to GDP ratio i s rising. The
SIAF was considerably extended to cover all central government and many local
governments, and practices are more transparent.
CAS assistance helped close the gap in the delivery o f social services. CAS activities
supported the allocation o f greater resources to meet social needs, and activities in primary
education are helping to boost the access to school by marginal groups.
However, the CAS also delivered results in some areas where questions have arisen
concerning either program impact or sustainability. For example, IEG has asked for an indepth review o f the impact o f judicial reform efforts, and noted some institutional risks in
land registration activities. IEG also expressed concerns about the sustainability o f
development outcomes under the Rural and M a i n Roads project.

The program could have been more effective if the Bank and the Government had
succeeded in reducing delays in project implementation. The long lead time for project
effectiveness affected both ongoing and new CAS projects. CAS impact was lessened and
postponed by effectiveness delays in the Health and Nutrition project, Education Quality
and Secondary Education project, and the second leg o f the Land administration APL.

81.
The CAS program also contributed, to varying degrees, to significant progress on longerterm development outcomes. Economic growth resumed in per capita terms and poverty rates are
finally starting to fall. Overall investment i s rising as i s FDI. Guatemala i s closing the ap with
Latin America in basic human resource indicators, such as in health and education!
Bank
support complemented the administration’s focus and leadership to achieve these results. As
noted, major contributions included support for macroeconomic stabilization, assistance to
improve the investment climate, efforts to realize a healthier financial sector, and activities to
boost educational outcomes. In some areas, Bank contributions were directed at building
institutions. These areas include roads, taxation, justice, land administration, and public financial
management. Future challenges include building on institutional gains to deliver on-the-ground
results, as suggested in the following recommendations.

VII. Summary Recommendations for the CPS
Strategic Recommendations

82.
Continue to support the governance agenda and build legitimacy. Efforts should be
strengthened to build the legitimacy o f institutions in line with the objectives o f the 1996 Peace
Accords. T h i s can be accomplished by firming up the governance agenda, building on achieved
gains and emphasizing the demand for good governance. Delivering real results should the
driving motif. First, the quality and coverage o f service delivery should be strengthened through
additional work in public financial management, decentralization, and direct support for public
institutions, including in health and education. Beneficiary surveys and other means o f
community participation should be harnessed to track impact. Efforts should also continue to
improve access to services among marginal populations, where extreme poverty remained
steady. The CCT program appears to be a step in the right direction. Second, improved service
delivery should be leveraged to increase the legitimacy o f revenue collection, while continued
improvements in tax and revenue institutions can further boost tax compliance. Improved
enforcement of Guatemala’s tax law can also generate buoyancy and greater revenues without
major increases in tax rates. Third, efforts to improve the justice system should focus on
satisfying the demand for legal and court services, rather than exclusively focusing on building
administrative capacity and ~overage.~’

48. See 2008 Poverty Report.
49. The current pipeline already foresees furthering the support for governance and service delivery: PFM
extension and self-standing support in health and education. Other development partners are providing technical
assistance in customs and taxation. The Bank could support policy fine-tuning and accompany the country towards
greater revenue mobilization, moving above the targets set by the Peace Accords. Building up the legitimacy of the
judiciary merits continued support.

83

83.
Focus on firming up competitiveness gains by leveraging greater access to international
markets, healthy macroeconomic fundamentals, an improved business environment, and interest
among domestic and foreign sources to invest in Guatemala. Ongoing analytical work should
help to identify remaining and emerging constrains to competiveness. For instance, firming up
gains in banking regulation should be complemented b y improving SME access to finance and
developing the non-banking financial sector. Additional support to strengthen property rights and
regional infrastructure should also help boost competitiveness. The likely slowdown of world
markets poses a risk to high growth, particularly given a possible drop in remittance income. In
this context, an assessment of risks to growth that includes development o f remedies could be a
valuable tool. Linking poor areas to markets and rural development should also be part of the
competitiveness agenda, to a degree beyond activities in the ongoing project.’’ Lastly, the
integration of Central American markets should advance beyond removing trade barriers to
greater integration in key sectors (i.e., energy, transport, etc.).

84.
Program effectiveness will be greatly enhanced if the forthcoming CPS precisely
delineates the links between Bank intervention outputs and results and Guatemala’s development
outcomes. Efforts should be made to strengthen the results framework along these lines.
Moreover, the program in Guatemala has successfully built several institutional platforms that
can contribute to sustained progress on development outcomes, and the challenge now i s to
produce these outcomes. It i s important in this context to clarify how interventions lead to
development results, leveraging analytical work and impact analysis, and attempting to
strengthen monitoring and evaluation.
Operational recommendations

85.
Work to reduce the project preparation, approval and execution gap. Several options
should be explored jointly with the authorities to achieve this objective. First, efforts should be
made to reduce project preparation time and to engage Congress to shorten effectiveness lags,
which have recently been over a year. One possible option i s to propose operations to the Board
early in the country political cycle, or very late so that a successor administration can leverage i t s
honeymoon period to win approval. In addition, the Bank should strive to reduce the number of
agencies involved in projects, and focus on a smaller number of critical interventions. In this
context, WBI could help develop a broader dialogue with Congress and civil society to broaden
the support for reform.
86.
Develop the basis to undertake quality impact analysis. It i s important that investment
projects, during their initial phases, gather the necessary baseline data to facilitate impact
analyses at project closings. Some projects have already done this, but this practice should be
generalized.

87.
Maintain, if amenable to the Government, the D P L structure. The Bank’s positive DPL
experience suggests retaining this instrument while maintaining a manageable agenda and
avoiding program overload. The focus on key priorities should remain. The DPL should be

50. The on-going pipeline with focus on infrastructure and business environment i s already a good point of
departure. A DPL series can help frame a competitiveness dialogue and focus on critical risks like the financial
sector.

84

complemented by support to improve public project evaluation in line with ongoing efforts to
introduce results-based budgeting.

88.

Continue efsorts to rely on country systems and seek strategic alliances with other
development partners to facilitate greater selectivity of Bank interventions. The improvements in

public financial management can be leveraged to promote greater use of country systems for
project implementation. These improvements can also facilitate harmonization with other
development partners, and help the World Bank move towards greater selectivity.

89.
Continue work to improve portfolio perj5ormance. As noted above, the quality of the
portfolio deteriorated in 2008 as new projects came on line and programs adjusted to the
government transition. Efforts should be strengthened to improve portfolio performance,
including, for example, broadening developmental dialogue to include all factors, such as the
parliamentary agenda, with a view to helping reach consensus.
