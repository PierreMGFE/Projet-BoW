Foreword
Panama’s economic performance has
been stellar over the past decade, and the
country has achieved remarkable progress
in reducing poverty and increasing shared
prosperity. Panama’s growth since 2001 was
more than double the average of the Latin
American and Caribbean region and its rate
of poverty reduction was greater than the regional average. Only Bolivia saw greater improvement in shared prosperity, as measured
by the growth of the income of the bottom
forty percent of the population, than Panama.
The rise of the middle class, seen in many
countries in the region, was particularly
marked in Panama and there has been an
overall decline in inequality.
This outstanding success, is the focus of
the World Bank’s latest report on Panama,
Panama: Locking in Success—A Systematic
Country Diagnostic. Building on the expertise of World Bank staff on economic, social,
and environmental topics this reports provides an in-depth look at the nature of the
country’s growth, the extent to which this
growth benefited all members of the society,
and the sustainability of the development
model. As such, Panama: Locking in Success
has served as the analytic underpinning of
the first of the World Bank’s new County
Partnership Frameworks.
There are two main messages that I take
from this report. The first one is that there
are many lessons that can be learnt from
Panama, for example, regarding the way
­successive administrations have stressed
the role of public investment, particularly

infrastructure, as a complement to private
investment. And this operating in a stable
and sustainable macroeconomic framework.
Of these public projects, probably the best
known is the expansion of the Panama
Canal, expected to start operating in 2016.
It is intended to double the capacity of the
Canal accommodating post-Panamax ships.
This in turn is expected to act as a catalyst of
new activities exploiting the opportunities of
the country as a logistic hub.
The second message is that even countries
as successful as Panama, have areas that require careful thought and where the World
Bank can be a partner. In Panama, for example, growth has not been enough to eliminate existing inequities in the country. For
example, the Indigenous Peoples living in
semi-autonomous provinces (comarcas) and
groups living in remote rural areas suffer
from higher poverty levels than the rest of
the country. Significant gaps in access to
basic services remain despite improvements
across the country. Ensuring that all population groups in the country benefit from
growth and have equal opportunities is a
highly relevant agenda going forward. Based
on a large array of analytical approaches, and
consultations with country stakeholders and
experts, Panama: Locking in Success identifies five priority areas for policy attention
needed to sustain Panama’s development
successes which include education and skills
mismatches, an inefficient energy sector,
public sector institutions, Indigenous
Peoples, and water management.

The goal of this report is to contribute
to the public debate around Panama’s challenges and opportunities. By having synthesized a substantial amount of the existing
research on Panama and generating new
analyses, the report brings this knowledge to
a broader public. At the same time, the systematic and comprehensive effort to identify
priority areas for the future can serve to

x

foster further investigation and promote a
deeper policy debate. I am sure that the present report can contribute to Panama’s bright
future.

Executive Summary
Panama has made significant progress in reducing poverty in recent years. Between 2007 and 2012, a period including the
Great Recession years, Panama managed to
reduce poverty (using the national poverty
line) from 39.9 percent to 26.2 percent, and
extreme poverty from 15.6 percent to 11.3
percent. Thus, in a population of about 3.6
million people, the number of Panamanians
living below the national extreme poverty
line declined by slightly more than 150,000
people and those living below the overall
poverty line declined by close to half a million people.
Panama’s progress in reducing poverty
and increasing shared prosperity compares
positively with the Latin American region.
Poverty reduction in the country was greater
than the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
average. Only Bolivia saw greater improvement in shared prosperity, as measured by
the growth of the income of the bottom 40
percent of the population, than Panama. The
rise in the middle class, seen in many countries in the region, was particularly marked
in Panama and there has been an overall decline in inequality.
This report takes stock of this progress,
and reflects on the constraints and opportunities that Panama faces in continuing on its
path of shared prosperity and poverty reduction. Following a detailed analysis of poverty—
recent trends, drivers of poverty reduction,
and demographic factors—the report provides
elements to answer three main questions. First,
what has driven growth in Panama in recent
years? Second, to what extent has this growth
been, or not been, inclusive? And, finally, how
Executive Summary

sustainable is the growth and, more generally,
the development model of Panama?
In doing so, the report identifies a select
list of policy priorities for poverty reduction
and shared prosperity in Panama. The analysis of the development challenges in any
country, including Panama, will likely find
that there is space for improvement on most
areas underlying development. However, a
long list of recommendations is likely to be
of limited use. Policy makers face budgetary
and political economy constraints that limit
their scope for action. Thus, an effort that
prioritizes among competing policy interventions will add significant value to any diagnostic of country development challenges.
Exploiting a diverse set of analytic tools, a
benchmarking exercise and country knowledge, this report also contributes to Panama’s
policy debate by identifying a select list of
priorities and opportunities.

The Nature of Growth
in Panama
Over the past decade, Panama has been
one of the fastest growing economies worldwide. Average annual growth was 7.2 percent
between 2001 and 2013 and Panama was an
outlier in terms of postcrisis recovery, having
had higher growth after the crisis than before.
Even though the growth rate is expected to
moderate to between six and seven percent
in 2014, this is one of the highest rates for
that year. In addition, not only has growth
been high but it has also been accompanied
by progressive distributional change.
1

Panama’s exceptional growth performance over the past decade stems from a
number of factors. The transfer of the Canal
to Panama in 2000 allowed Panama not only
to benefit from the growth of world trade but
also to leverage its geographical position to
transform itself into a well-connected logistics and trade hub and a financial center.
Complementing this strength, Panama has
undertaken important public investment
projects, such as the expansion of the Canal
and the construction of the Metro in Panama
City. In the process, it has managed to attract
increasing foreign direct investment (FDI)
flows and private investment. As a result of
these factors, and the underlying stable
­macroeconomic environment, Panama’s real
growth since 2001 has been more than double the average for LAC. The country has
been one of the few that have been able to
catch up with the United States in terms of
per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in
recent years and its growth rate displayed
low volatility in international comparison.
As a result, it has consolidated its position as
the most competitive economy in Central
America and is second only to Chile in LAC.
There are good reasons to expect that
growth will continue to be strong in Panama
(around six percent) in the near future. The
completion of major infrastructure projects
(Canal expansion and the first Metro line)
will lower public investment in the coming
years; however, this will be offset by the
planned construction of the second Metro
line, and the additional traffic generated by
the expanded Canal. In addition, there is no
indication of a downturn in private investment according to residential and non-­
residential construction leading indicators
(such as construction permits). The continued stable macroeconomic environment
2

and recent moves by the government to ensure that the banking sector meets international standards will also continue to make
Panama an attractive country for FDI. The
prospects of sustained high growth in the
coming years are also supported by emerging
opportunities in key sectors such as transport and logistics, mining, financial services,
and tourism.
Nonetheless, certain structural areas require attention to ensure that Panama meets
these high growth expectations: infrastructure, particularly energy; education and skills;
and public sector institutions. For example,
the energy sector has not been able to keep
pace with the growing demand of a high performing economy, and this issue will likely
become even more binding as the economy
continues to grow at healthy levels. Likewise,
while the country has made large gains in
education in recent years, the transformation
and modernization of the economy has exposed weaknesses in both the coverage and
quality of secondary and tertiary education.
Finally, there is an obvious mismatch between the increasing sophistication of Panama’s economy and the effectiveness of its
public institutions. Challenges are most
marked in transparency, efficiency, and the
adequacy of the regulatory framework.

Inclusion and Economic
Growth
Panama’s growth has been inclusive along many dimensions. Over the past
years, growth has been accompanied by declines in income inequality, and vulnerable
groups in society (poor, women, unskilled)
have significantly benefited from growth. For
example, the average income growth of the
Executive Summary

bottom 40 percent (8.2 percent per year between 2007 and 2012) was significantly higher
than income growth for the average Panamanian (6.6 percent per year). Similarly, the
percentage of female-headed households that
escaped poverty between 2007 and 2012 (14
percent) was higher than the percentage of
male-headed households escaping poverty
(12.3 percent) and today, the difference in
the poverty rates between female- and maleheaded households is less than one percent
(2.6 percent in 2007). The economy has also
managed to generate a large number of jobs
for the unskilled: an increase of almost 12
percent. The positive effects of economic
growth on poverty came through a combination of increased labor income and a strong
program of public transfers. Labor income
was the key driver of both poverty and extreme poverty reduction in urban areas, but
government transfers were the main force
behind poverty and extreme poverty reduction in rural areas.
The degree of inclusion has varied across
the country and across population groups.
Despite the strong pro-poor growth, sharp
regional disparities remain. Take the case
of Ngäbe Buglé comarca, Panama’s poorest
area, where 93 percent of the population is
poor—compared to 26 percent for the country as a whole, and only 15 percent in the
richest province. The rate of change of poverty also varied. While urban extreme poverty fell 40 percent between 2007 and 2012,
in rural areas the decline was 15 percent, and
in the indigenous territories, or comarcas,
only four percent. This has resulted in an increasing concentration of the extremely poor
in the indigenous territories. Finally, among
the poor and extremely poor in Panama, the
groups with the least human capital, lowest
incomes, and greatest dependence on social
Executive Summary

assistance are the indigenous population living in the comarcas.
Benchmarking across indigenous groups
in the region shows Panama to be lagging
in economic and social development. In absolute and relative terms, Panama’s indigenous populations fare poorly compared to
other Indigenous Peoples in Latin America.
The differences in terms of access to services
are striking. Among 12 Latin American
countries, Panama has both the lowest level
of electricity coverage among the indigenous
population and the largest gap between indigenous and non-indigenous populations
(52 percentage points compared to the next
largest gap of 38 percentage points in Colombia). The gap in sanitation is also the largest, and only Nicaragua has lower absolute
levels. The situation is similar for piped water
and Internet access.
While reducing poverty in Panama will
require attention to all deprived groups,
the concentration of the poor in comarcas
suggests that this would be a priority area.
The Indigenous Peoples of Panama have significant social capital, and their lands represent significant wealth and biodiversity.
At the same time they suffer from multiple
deprivations: extremely low incomes, low
­access to basic services and infrastructure,
lower human capital, poorer health outcomes,
fewer labor options, and de facto land tenure
insecurity. Investments in basic infrastructure in roads, electrification, and sewage systems would benefit both rural indigenous
and non-indigenous groups. However, improving social service for the indigenous will
require special attention to accommodate
their cultural norms. In short, while Panama’s
agenda on eradicating extreme poverty is
much broader than just the comarcas, the
levels and severity of poverty in these areas
3

and the slowness of positive change suggest
that focusing on the comarcas is a priority.
At the same time, it is important to understand the complexities of addressing the
development challenges of the comarcas and
the need to pay attention to issues of (i) culturally appropriate economic opportunities,
(ii) social assistance, and (iii) infrastructure
provision. The lack of culturally appropriate
models for development for the comarcas has
reduced the positive impact of government
programs and policies. Differences in community organization and communal property,
among others, need to be taken into account.
Furthermore, a good understanding of the
tradeoffs that Indigenous Peoples are, and are
not, willing to make among different goals
will be key to finding sustainable solutions.
In this regard, the National Integrated Development Plan of the Indigenous Peoples of
Panama (DIPORP), completed by the National
Indigenous Working Group after a two-­year
effort, provides an opportunity to tackle poverty in the comarcas. The Plan presents the consensual vision of the goals and priorities of the
12 indigenous congresses on economic development, social development, and legal rights.
The challenges faced by the social protection system in the comarcas also merit further attention given that outcomes are muted
despite good spending levels. Indeed, the
benefits of Red de Oportunidades, the conditional cash transfer program for the most
vulnerable, in the comarcas, appear to have
been limited by a lack of differential ethnic
services for the various ethnic groups. In this
regard, the adaptation of service provision to
the environment is critical, including, for example, offering multicultural bilingual education in indigenous areas or ensuring that
health workers are equipped to work in different cultural contexts.
4

Lack of services, particularly access to water
and sanitation, continues to be a constraint
in the comarcas. Low population density and
dispersed populations are often blamed for
lack of service provision in these areas. This
is a challenge that needs to be acknowledged;
but the fact that Los Santos, one of the three
provinces with the highest rate of poverty reduction in the past six years, has a population
density below that of the poorest comarca
suggests that additional barriers to service
provision are at play.

Sustainability: Economic,
Social, and Environmental
Can Panama sustain this progress and
improve on it? Whether Panama can sustain
the progress observed in previous years depends on the extent to which attention
is paid to critical economic, social and environmental issues.
Panama’s continued high reliance on foreign financing for its investment program
will depend on continued progress on compliance with international finance standards.
The Panamanian government is working on
reforms to address these concerns but is still
under a peer review process. The first phase
of this review involves an assessment of legal
and regulatory frameworks; the second phase
consists of an assessment of how well the
country is doing on tax transparency in line
with international standards. Based on the
outcome of the first phase, Panama is currently undertaking reform measures to allow
it to move on to phase two of the process.
Sustainability will also depend on Panama’s successfully assessing and mitigating
the various sources of competition to the
Panama Canal, given its crucial role for the
Executive Summary

country’s economy. To the east, the recent
project by Egypt to widen parts of the Suez
Canal will enlarge transit capacity and decrease waiting time from 18 to 11 hours for
most ships. Closer to home, Panama’s northern neighbor Nicaragua has recently announced the initiation of a project to build a
Nicaragua Canal passing through Lake Managua. Once completed, this canal could
have significant impact on the share of trade
going to Panama. Finally, in the medium to
long term, the Northern Passage may open
up as global warming melts the Arctic ice
cap, substantially reducing the distance between Asia, Europe, and North America.
Competition to the Canal requires constant
adjustment of its pricing policy to maintain
market edge and competitiveness within the
global market.
On the social front, the country’s cohesion is threatened by existing inequalities,
the crime and violence linked to Panama’s
strategic position as a drug corridor, and
weak protection of land rights. The stark
economic inequalities and relative deprivations, coupled with more precarious forms of
urban employment and perceptions, along
with evidence of corruption have been creating strains on society. Relative deprivation
has led some groups to further organize and
assert political voice (such as through the
Mesa Indigena) but has also led to increases
in violence in urban areas when combined
with the illegal drug trade. However, the risks
from crime and violence affect not only urban
youth but also rural and indigenous populations. Struggles around infringements of indigenous land rights also pose serious threats
to social sustainability. This is particularly
the case when one considers mining, which
has the potential to be a key source of growth
in the coming years but which will need to
Executive Summary

overcome potential opposition from the indigenous populations living in the areas where
the mining deposits are.
While the risks to social cohesion exist,
various factors may play a mitigating role.
The recent success the government has had
in reining in homicide rates suggests that
Panama may be able to avoid the escalation
of crime and violence seen in neighboring
countries. The youth gang movement is nascent and appears amenable to intervention.
Ratification of the International Labor Organization Convention 169 could help promote
land and other rights because ratification
would trigger international supervision of
the Convention’s implementation, thus providing more visibility to land rights issues.
The planned creation of a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs to help promote economic and
social welfare of the Indigenous Peoples in
the country and support the National Integrated Development Plan of the Indigenous
Peoples of Panama provides further opportunities for improvements in the protection
of land and resources rights of the Indigenous Peoples in Panama.
Environmental sustainability depends on
safeguarding Panama’s water and natural resources and on putting in place adequate
regulation to mitigate the effects of large infrastructure and extractive projects, rapid
urbanization, and risk from to natural disasters. Safeguarding Panama’s water and natural resource base is critical to the current
growth model linked to the Canal and other
economic activities. In terms of long-term
climate change, the recent International Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment
(IPCC 2014) cites a trend of increasing precipitation over most of Panama. This is generally good news for the Canal. However,
greater variability, with more frequent floods
5

and droughts, is also predicted and poses a
real risk. The country’s infrastructure-based
growth model requires strong environmental
regulation and enforcement to avoid longterm irreversible negative impacts. In particular, the growth of the mining sector raises
significant potential environmental risks due
to the lack of an adequate regulatory framework that regulates safe and sustainable mining permits. The challenge of improving the
urban environment is amplified by the ongoing process of decentralization that has not
been coupled with adequate municipal capacity building. Finally, the increasing risks
of natural disasters require an integrated
mitigation strategy.
Water resources management under varying climate conditions emerges as a priority
area linked to sustainability. Benchmarking
across time highlights the greater incidence
of extreme weather events in the last decades.
Climate models predict this to be the new
norm. The effects on the economy are multiple, including, most critically, the effect on
the Canal operations as greater variability in
rainfall and extreme weather can lead to
temporary closures (this has happened four
times to date). Changes in rainfall in other
areas of the country can affect hydro-electrical power generation, a key energy source for
the country. And, of course, extreme weather
can affect agriculture, the main source of income for many of the poor in the country.

Priority Areas and
Complementarities
Valuable synergies emerge from looking at priorities and opportunities across
the themes of growth, inclusion and

6

sustainability. The analysis has been framed
to answer three key questions: What is the
nature of growth? How inclusive is it? and
How sustainable is it? The analysis identified
five priority areas: (i) infrastructure with a focus
on energy, (ii) education and skills, (iii) public sector institutions, (iv) Indigenous Peoples,
and (v) water resources management. But
beyond the relevance of each of these areas
for growth, inclusion, and sustainability, it is
important to also highlight the complementarities that exist across them. Some simple
examples illustrate this point. Education and
skills have been identified as a priority for
economic growth: a well-­educated workforce
with relevant skills is fundamental to sustain
economic growth. In parallel, closing the education gap between the poor and non-poor
is also highly relevant for inclusion by providing opportunities to rural and indigenous
Panamanians. Institutional capacity clearly
affects growth, inclusion and sustainability.
In terms of opportunities within these
areas, those identified to improve public institutions provide a clear example of the synergies. Performance-based budgeting or
enhanced fiscal management along with other
opportunities will free resources that could
be spent on other areas, including education
or Indigenous Peoples. Moreover, enforcing
consistent social and environmental safeguards,
regulations, and standards across sectors will
have an important positive impact on water
resources management.

Knowledge Gaps
In the process of reviewing, analyzing
and synthesizing the existing data and research on Panama, a series of knowledge
gaps were discovered. By discovering and

Executive Summary

describing these gaps, this report outlines a
roadmap for further research on Panama that
will benefit the design of specific policies in
the priority areas identified in this report and
generate information that can lead to the
identification of new priority areas. Knowledge gaps are, in some cases, data related
(poverty by all ethnic groups, for example).

Table ES.1

In other cases there is a need for more analytical work (qualitative and quantitative
work on the causes of dropout rates in Panama or the creation of simulation tools on
growth or climate, for example). Focus on
filling these knowledge gaps will ensure the
best possible analytic base for future work on
prioritization in the country.

Executive Summary

1. Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama
Panama has made significant progress ​
on the poverty reduction front over the past
five years.1 Between 2007 and 2012, a period
including the years of the Great Recession,
Panama managed to reduce poverty (using
the national poverty line) from 39.9 percent
to 26.2 percent, and extreme poverty from
15.6 percent to 11.3 percent (figure 1.1).
Thus, in a population of about 3.6 million
people, the number of Panamanians living
below the national extreme poverty line declined by slightly more than 150,000 people,
and those living below the moderate poverty
line declined by close to half a million ­people.
Panama’s progress in reducing poverty
compares positively with the Latin American
region. Indeed, using a US$4 a day poverty
line, moderate poverty declined from 33.5
percent of the population in 2007 to 20.9

percent in 2012. This compares with a poverty decline in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region from 32.2 percent to
25 percent over the same period. Likewise,
extreme poverty (using a US$2.5 poverty
line) declined from 19.2 percent to 11.8
percent, compared to a decline in the region
from 17 percent to 12 percent (­figure 1.2).
Extreme poverty, as measured by the international US$1.25 poverty line (used by the
World Bank to measure progress toward the
twin goals) would be four percent, which is
close to the World Bank’s global extreme
poverty target of three percent for 2030.
The observed declines in poverty rates
have been accompanied by a significant increase in the middle class. When measured
as the share of the population with incomes
between US$10 and US$50 a day (as done in

the Economic Mobility and the Rise of the
Middle Class report, Ferreira et al. 2015), the
Panamanian middle class increased by about
10 percentage points from 29.7 percent in
2007 to 39.7 in 2012. This is consistent
with—although more marked than—the
evolution of the middle class in the Latin
American region, which also increased from
27.4 percent to 34.2 percent (figure 1.3).
As a result, the middle class has been the
largest group in Panama since 2011. The
typical transition from poverty to middle
class is through the vulnerable class (that is,
a group of the population that, while not
poor, has a significant chance of falling into
poverty in the coming years). In Panama in
2007, the middle class was as large as the
population living in poverty but began increasing between 2007 and 2010 as poverty
declined. Starting in 2011, the vulnerable
class was smaller than the middle class.2 This
is unlike in Latin America as a whole where,

despite the evolution of the middle class, the
vulnerable group continues to be the largest.
As in most Latin American countries,
there are important differences between poverty levels in rural and urban areas. Despite
the fact that 75 percent of Panamanians live
in urban areas and two-thirds of those in
Panama City, the urban-rural discrepancies
are still important. For example, while in
urban areas extreme poverty is below
four percent, in rural areas extreme poverty
is about 27 percent. Moreover, in contrast to
urban areas, where poverty has fallen every
year since 2007, extreme poverty levels have
fluctuated in rural areas and indeed increased in 2010 and 2012 (figure 1.4). But
perhaps more worrisome, as discussed in
Chapter 4 of this document, poverty rates
vary dramatically across the country. In the
Indigenous Peoples’ territories (figures 4.7
and 4.8), poverty is almost universal and
persistent (declining at a rate below the

Indigenous Peoples Demographics and Data

Panama has a population of around four million people living in 10 provinces, 75 districts
or municipalities, five collective and semi-autonomous Indigenous territories organized
by ethnic groups (comarcas), and 620 corregimientos. The tenth province was created when
the original Province of Panama was divided into two—Panama and Panama Oueste—in
January of 2014. Due to the recent split, the analysis here looks at the original Province
of Panama.

Panama is home to eight Indigenous ethnic groups or “peoples,” namely the Ngäbe or
Ngöbe (260,058), Kuna or Guna (80,526), Emberá (31,284), Buglé (24,912), Wounaan
(7,279), Teribe/Naso (4,046), Bokota (1,959), and Bribri (1,068). The 2010 census shows
that 196,059 indigenous persons live in comarcas, while 221,500 live in other areas. The
comarcas and other indigenous territories enjoy significant autonomy and self-­government
through 10 Congresses and two Councils. The comarcas make up 22.2 percent of the
country’s area, or 16,634 square kilometers, and comprise some of Panama’s richest natural
resources and cultural diversity. Panama is also home to a population of Afro-descendants
representing 9.2 percent of the national population in 2010. The majority live in Colón
(29 percent), Darién (17 percent), and Panama City (11 percent).

Data on the full population of the Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants is limited. The
annual household survey used to measure welfare does not include an ethnicity variable.
In most of the analysis here, the geographic variable comarca is used as a proxy for persons of indigenous origin. This has three problems: (i) this captures only the three largest
comarcas; (ii) there are small numbers of non-indigenous people who live in the comarcas;
and (iii) using the comarca variable excludes the half of the indigenous population that
lives in other parts of the country from the analysis. There is also no way to identify
Afro-descendants from the household survey because they are included in the urban or
rural areas in which they live. The only data source that allows a comparison to be made
of these two groups is the National Population and Housing Census carried out every ten
years: these data are used as much as possible. Thus, the discussion of welfare of these
groups is constrained. These knowledge gaps merit further attention in Panama.

national average). For example, the Ngäbe
Buglé comarca has a poverty rate of
93 percent and an extreme poverty rate of
80 percent. These poverty rates surpass poverty among indigenous peoples in other
countries including Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru.3
Beyond the progress made on poverty reduction, Panama has also made significant
progress on shared prosperity. Average per
capita income, as measured by household
surveys, grew by 6.6 percent between 2007
and 2012 whereas the average incomes of the
bottom 40 percent of the population rose 8.2
percent (figure 1.5).4 These statistics indicate
not only that growth has been pro-poor—​
having a clear bias toward the poor—but also
that the increase in their incomes has been
significant: at this rate, the incomes of the
poor would double every nine years. It is also
worth noting that in Latin America only Bolivia saw greater income growth among the
bottom 40 percent of the population.
12

However, like the poverty reduction story,
not everyone in the bottom 40 percent has
shared equally in Panama’s prosperity. The
bottom 40 percent of the population has
seen its income rise in all provinces (those
that existed before January 2014) and the
three comarcas (figure 1.6). Those among the
bottom 40 percent of the national population
who lived in Coclé, Veraguas, and Los Santos
saw the highest average income growth—
which in the case of Coclé was close to
10 percent. However, in the comarcas captured by the data, growth was much lower at
only 2.4 percent. And only in the comarcas
was the overall average income growth (five
percent) greater than that of the bottom 40
percent. Compared with national data, the
per capita income growth in the comarcas
was 1.6 percentage points lower than the national growth rate; and the income of the
bottom 40 percent was 3.7 times lower than
the income of the bottom 40 percent at the
national level. Indeed, as discussed later,

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama

13

even though the number of extremely poor
has declined significantly in the country, the
comarcas historically have been, and are now
even more so, the places where extreme poverty is most prevalent in Panama.
The extremely poor are highly concentrated
in remote geographic areas where Indigenous
Peoples live. The indigenous populations living in the three largest comarcas represent
42 percent of the extremely poor, but at the
same time represent less than seven percent
of the country’s population (although Indigenous Peoples represent 12.2 percent of the
total population). Many of the Indigenous
Peoples in Panama live outside but in close
proximity to the comarcas with collective title,
as is the case of the Naso territory, two Wounaan communities in Darién, and the Dagargunyala collective territory. Many others are
awaiting territorial recognition and titling, as
is the case of the Bri-Bri and many communities in Darién. The communities without land
tenure security are at the greatest risk because
of land invasions by non-indigenous farmers,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(in the case of Darién), and parties interested
in resource extraction.
At the same time, lack of opportunities
within these areas has forced many indigenous people to migrate to cities. According to
the 2010 census, only 40 percent of the Guna
population now lives in the three Guna comarcas; 52.3 percent of Ngäbe and Buglé people live within their comarca; and in the case
of the Emberá and Wounaan, only 24 per­cent
of the population is living within the comarca.5
Internal migration among the indigenous
population in Panama is higher than in most
other Latin American ­countries.6
Nonetheless, inequality has not been an
issue exclusive to the Indigenous Peoples.
There is a universal perception in Panama
14

that Afro-descendants have also been excluded from the country’s economic growth
and face difficult challenges, including lack
of access to basic services, such as water,
electricity, sanitation, education, employment, health services, and political participation. While the limited data available do not
completely support this perception, qualitative studies indicate that Afro-descendants
rank among the poorest and most vulnerable
groups in the country.7
This raises a question about the factors
driving poverty reduction in Panama. Over
the past decade, Panama has been one of
the fastest growing economies worldwide.
With an average annual growth rate of
7.2 percent between 2001 and 2013, Panama has outpaced most of its peer countries
and grown significantly faster than the average country in any of the analyzed peer
groups.8 The country has been one of the
few that have been able to catch up with the
United States in terms of per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) in recent years
(figure 1.7) and Panama has been an outlier
in terms of postcrisis recovery (figure 1.8);
while most countries were not able to catch
up to their pre-crisis dynamism, Panama
had higher growth after the crisis than before. Even though the growth rate is expected to moderate to around seven percent
in 2014, this is one of the highest rates for
that year. In addition, not only has growth
been high, but it has also been accompanied by progressive distributional change.
Growth accounted for about 80 percent
of poverty reduction and the reduction in
inequality accounted for the remaining
20 percent between 2007 and 2012. The recent high GDP growth rates experienced by
Panama would suggest that growth has
played a predominant role in explaining
Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama

poverty reduction; inequality has fallen
only slowly (figure 1.9). We test this hypothesis by performing a Datt-Ravallion
decomposition,9 which attempts to identify
the relative contributions of growth and
changes in inequality for any given poverty
change. The results of this decomposition
are displayed in figure 1.10 confirming the
hypothesis that growth accounted for about
80 percent of the poverty gains and inequality for about 20 percent. This is in
contrast to the Latin American region,
where growth has been admittedly lower
and the gains on the inequality front more,
where over the same period of time, growth
would have accounted for 57 percent of
poverty reduction and inequality for
43 percent.
The positive changes in poverty measured
by cross-sectional household data hide some
of the movements of the population in and
out of poverty. A synthetic panel, constructed
Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama

a la Dang et al. (2011), shows that the 2007–
2012 period saw people moving out of, but
also into, poverty. The synthetic panel results
in terms of poverty numbers do not completely align with the national figures, but the
analysis does highlight several important
movements of households (figure 1.11 and
figure 1.12).10 First, households with low educational levels (primary or below) and those
engaged in agriculture were the most likely to
have been poor in 2007 and remained poor
in 2012. Second, households in the agricultural sector and in the bottom income quintile were the least likely to move out of
poverty and most likely to fall into poverty.
Finally, urban areas overall showed the greatest movements out of poverty.
But what sources of income have helped
people move out of poverty? To understand
the different factors that have contributed to
poverty reduction, it is important to explore
developments in labor markets (which typically generate the main income of the poor)
as well as the role of public spending, including transfers (both cash and in kind) to the
poor. The rest of this section explores these
issues.
Panama has been a top performer in terms
of creating jobs, and the poor have benefited
from it. In 2013, the employed labor force in
Panama was 66 percent higher than in 2001,
an increase that far exceeds those of peer
countries.11 For example, the corresponding
increase among the structural peer countries
was 17 percent, and in Central America as a
whole it was 44 percent (figure 1.13). The
bottom 40 percent have benefitted from this
job creation. While the bulk of net new jobs
required completed secondary education or
higher, 11.5 percent of new jobs were for unskilled labor with primary or incomplete secondary education. In 2012, the average years

of schooling of the bottom 40 percent of the
population was 7.6 years compared to 11.7
for the rest of the population (figure 1.14).
There is a large gap between the extremely poor and the rest of the population. The heads of extremely poor

households in Panama have only 5.1 years
of education—4.5 years fewer than the national average. They are also concentrated
in the agricultural sector and work mainly
as self-employed or unpaid family workers.
The households of the extreme poor have
much higher dependency ratios, driven by
a much greater share of young children,
and lower life expectancy. For every worker
in an extremely poor household, there are
2.2 dependents, while the national average
is 1.3. The dependency ratio for working
age people (15 to 64 years) is 1.25 for extremely poor households, while the national average is 0.5.
Social spending has increased in real
terms also benefitting the poor. Between
2007 and 2012, education and health spend­
ing have stayed relatively flat at around
four percent of GDP (in a context of very
rapid GDP growth), while social protection
has decreased by half a percentage point of

GDP (figure 1.15).With 13.3 percent of
GDP in 2013, Panamanian social expenditure was in the middle range for Central
America. In that year, Costa Rica dedicated
almost 21 percent of GDP to social expenditure, and Guatemala spent only eight
percent. In real terms, social spending has
grown three percent annually over the analyzed period.12 Although access to health
and education services has improved for all
Panamanians, significant inequalities persist with less access in rural and indigenous
areas where a large percentage of the poor
and extremely poor live. Chapter 4 of this
report provides more detail on the incidence of social spending.
The country has continuously expanded
the coverage of its social protection system.
In 2006, Red de Oportunidades, a conditional

18

cash transfer program, was introduced to
support families in poverty; in 2009, 100 a
los 70 followed to support elderly in need; in
2010, Beca Universal was put in place to
­provide a cash transfer to children for school
achievements; and in 2012, Angel Guardian
was established to provide social assistance
to people with severe disabilities in poverty
or vulnerable conditions. Although the quality of the targeting of these programs differs
and can be further improved, a large share
of their benefits reaches the lowest income
percentiles. Chapter 4 provides further detail on social protection, its incidence, and
targeting.
Progress toward the twin goals has been
achieved not only because of the pace of
growth but also because of its low volatility.
Panama has stood out not only in terms of

its fast economic growth but also in terms of
the low volatility of that growth (­figure 1.16).
In the sample of peer ­countries, only a few,
such as Bolivia and Guatemala, had lower
coefficients of variation of GDP growth,
however at significantly lower average GDP
growth rates. As mentioned before, the low
volatility of economic growth is highly relevant for achieving the twin goals. This is due
to the impact of overall output volatility on
consumption as well as the negative link between macroeconomic volatility and
­equality.13

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama

This report (i) explores the elements behind the observed growth, poverty, and inequality trends; (ii) identifies the factors that
may affect the sustainability of Panama’s recent performance and thus the priority areas
for action or policy; and (iii) highlights specific opportunities for the country to continue as one of the best performers in the
Latin American region on growth and poverty reduction. The rest of the report is
structured as follows. Chapter 2 looks in
more depth at the evolution and features of
economic growth and what may affect it
going forward. Chapter 3 compares Panama’s progress to other countries to identify
priority areas linked to maintaining growth
and opportunities of which the country
might well take advantage. The chapter contains a brief discussion of the prioritization
process. Chapter 4 focuses on issues of inclusiveness, laying out the evidence of progress as well as the limits on this progress.
Chapter 5 attempts to benchmark Panama’s
progress on inclusion to that of other Latin
American countries, identifying ethnicity as
a priority area and drawing out opportunities for action. Chapter 6 addresses the issue
of sustainability from different lenses: economic, social, and environmental. Chapter
7, using an over-time benchmarking approach, lays out the case for water to be the
final priority area and identifies opportunities for action. The final chapter covers
knowledge gaps that arose during the process of preparing this report, gaps that
would ideally be the focus of any subsequent
analysis for Panama’s ability to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth and make inroads on the twin goals.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama

Notes
1. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis uses national definitions of poverty and shared prosperity (both poverty lines and the income
aggregate). The analysis focuses on the 2007–
2012 period for reasons of data comparability
that limit the use of longer time trends. While
every effort has been made to replicate the welfare measure used in Panama, there are some
slight discrepancies (see Cadena et al. 2013)
that are not expected to change the story in
any way. The value of the national poverty line
was US$7.9/day urban and US$5.8/day rural.
2. Ferreira et al. (2015).
3. Using an international poverty line of
US$4 per person per day. This is based on
the harmonized dataset SEDLAC (CEDLAS
and World Bank) 2015 and, Economic
Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean, 2014.
4. The process of data harmonization for
cross-country comparisons means that the
comparable results differ from those for
Panama alone as the construction of measures
for one country are quite different from what
has to be done in a multi-country context.
5. Based on Population and Housing Census of
Panama.
6. Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean (ECLAC) (2014).

7. Generating quantitative data on Afrodescendants will be necessary to create an accurate picture of absolute and relative poverty
levels of this ethnic group.
8. Appendix A contains the types of peer countries (regional, aspirational, structural) and
the countries included in each peer group.
9. See Datt and Ravallion (1992).
10. The synthetic panel uses a different poverty line
(US$4 per day) and, by construction, can only
include a subset of households, i.e., those that
have the potential to be in both periods. Thus
households with very young heads in 2012 will
be excluded from this analysis. Both of these
characteristics of the synthetic panel analysis
mean that the estimated levels of poverty will differ between this analysis and the national figures.
11. Appendix A provides detailed definitions
of the different peer groups. Based on IMF
WEO data on changes in the labor force corrected for unemployment.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Panama

2. The Nature of Panama’s Economic
Growth
Panama’s exceptional growth performance over the past decade stems from an
open and competitive economy. Panama’s
real growth since 2001 has averaged 7.2
percent, more than double the average for
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).
The country has been one of the few that
have been able to catch up with the United
States in terms of per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) in recent years (figure 1.7),
and its growth rate displayed low volatility
in international comparison (figure 1.16).
The economy is one of the most open in the
region (figure 2.1) and is well integrated
into the global economy. It has done well in
leveraging its geographical position, including through the Panama Canal, transforming
itself into a well-connected logistics and

trade hub and a financial center. Through
continuous improvements in infrastructure,
Panama has established a port network that
is on par with major international logistics
hubs and an airport network that allows
the country to function as a major regional
passenger hub for connecting passengers between North, Central, and South America.
Thus, the country has consolidated its position as the most competitive economy
in Central America and is second after Chile
in LAC, according to the 2014–15 Global
Competitiveness Report (Schwab and Sala-iMartin 2014).
In recent years, five main elements have
explained this growth performance: (i) the
transfer of the Canal to Panama that has allowed Panama to benefit from the growth of

and expansion of the Canal that spilled over
to growth in specific sectors; (iii) the increasing role of public investment; (iv) the parallel
increase in foreign direct investment (FDI)
and private investment; and (v) a stable macroeconomic environment. The rest of this
section discusses these elements.

The Canal and Trends in
World Trade
The acceleration of growth followed
the transfer of the Canal to Panama and coincided with its successful management. The
United States built the Panama Canal zone in
the ten-year period from 1904 to 1914 after
receiving a concession for the construction
and operation of the Canal and the areas surrounding it. In 1977, the two countries
signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties that laid
the foundation for the gradual return of the
Canal to the Panamanian government. On
December 31, 1999, the transfer became effective.1 Since then, the Canal has been managed by an autonomous government agency,
the Autoridad del Canal de Panama (Panama
Canal Authority, or ACP), which is widely
recognized for its institutional capacity and
efficient management. Even though there is
no stringent proof of causality, the increased
trend of the growth of the transport and
communications sector in particular seems
to have followed the return of the Canal to
Panama. After the transfer in 1999, trend
growth, both of the transport and communications sector, as well as of the economy as a
whole, have accelerated (figure 2.3).
The Canal has allowed the country to
benefit from the increased world trade due to
the fast growth of large emerging economies,
24

such as China. The recent catching up with
United States per capita income seems to
have started in 2003 (figure 2.4). Even
though Panama’s convergence towards the
United States was faster than that of LAC as
a whole, the inflection points coincide.
Therefore, it seems that a set of common factors might have driven both Panama’s take
off as well as the resurgence of growth in the
rest of Latin America, albeit by different
magnitudes. A forthcoming World Bank
study suggests that these common factors are
associated with the relatively fast growth of
large emerging markets, such as China.2
However, it is likely that the main channels
of transmission from the growth of China to
Panama have been different from those affecting other fast-growing Latin American
countries, such as Bolivia, Chile, Colombia
or Peru: for Panama, it is the Canal, rather
than commodities.
Transshipment of goods originating in
and destined for China has surged, and the
increases in revenues from the Canal between 2000 and 2013 are significant. During
these years, the value of world trade almost
tripled from US$6,725 billion to US$18,890
billion. At the same time, the value of trade
that passed through the Canal increased by
16 percent, from US$374 billion to US$434
billion between 2006 and 2013. Overall the
share of total world trade going through the
Canal slightly decreased from three percent
in 2006 to 2.3 percent in 2013. The origins
and destinations of goods passing through
the Canal reflect China’s increasing role in
world trade. In 2013, the share of goods
originating in China was 7.6 percent, while
the share of goods destined for China was
14.5 percent. Because the size of the largest
ships that cruise the Canal has increased
and therefore the same volume of

merchandise could be transported through
the Canal with fewer shipments, overall passages through the Canal have declined from
12,198 vessels in 2001 to 12,045 in 2013.3
The increase in trading volumes and passages has led to an increase in collected
tolls from US$580 million to US$1.847 billion over the same period, and 1.7 and 2.4
percent of GDP in non-tax revenue to the
government.
The resilience of Canal revenues is due to
both the variety of goods going through the
Canal and a proactive fee policy by the ACP.
The three main types of cargo going through
the Canal are containers, grains, and oil
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

(table 2.1). Containers mainly carry different
types of manufactured goods and minerals.
The ACP constantly adjusts fees in order to
compete worldwide, and the fees are based
on volume and weight of the cargo (not the
value). For this purpose, a special measurement has been created, the Panama Canal
tons.4 As a result, Canal revenues have continuously increased even in years when total
cargo was declining, as for example in 2009.
Moreover, the variety of goods as well as the
adjustments in fees has decoupled Canal revenues from the price movements of any one
good. Even fluctuations in overall commodity prices that commoved with the value of

The Impact of the Canal
on Growth in Specific
Sectors
The Canal has affected the Panamanian
economy both directly and indirectly. In addition to the direct effects through transport
and communication as well as the ongoing
construction to expand the Canal, Canal operations have positively affected the rest of
the economy. The Canal drives the bulk of
Panamanian service exports.5 In particular, it
generates revenues for the local economy
and creates employment in the logistics sector. The recent expansion of the Canal is the
largest project at the Canal since its
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

construction and the largest infrastructure
project in Panama. The expansion will double the Canal’s capacity, increasing economies of scale and international maritime
trade. The expansion program consists of
four main components: (i) a third set of new
locks, (ii) a Pacific access channel, (iii)
dredging of navigation channels, and (iv)
improvements to water supply. The impact of
the Canal expansion will benefit the economy through the construction stage and
through the increase in traffic, which in turn
is expected to boost Canal-related activities.
The government is also expected to have a
significant inflow of additional revenues.6
Taking advantage of its geographic position and the Canal, Panama has transformed
itself into a regional logistics hub performing
very well on indicators of connectivity and
logistics. The country has developed a
27

sophisticated transport infrastructure
around the Canal (figure 2.6). In particular,
Panama has first-world infrastructure assets,
with the Panama Canal as an axis for structuring the development of its logistics services. Currently, the majority of logistics
operators of the world have permanent operational presence in Panama. This has resulted in the availability of a wide range of
logistics services, mainly devoted to maritime cargo. It is one of the most connected
countries in the region and has the highest
Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) in
the LAC region (Panama has achieved a
score of 45, ahead of Mexico, 42, and Brazil,

37—and even ahead of developed countries
like Canada, 38).7 Its geographic position
and the Panama Canal give it an advantage
when compared to other countries in the region. However, connectivity falls short of
what other major logistics hubs such as
Singapore and Hong Kong SAR, China
achieve (scoring 107 and 117, respectively)
on the LSCI. In the same vein, Panama lags
behind these economies in terms of the
2014 Logistic Performance Index (figures 2.7
and 2.8). Hence, the potential to attract additional services by developing value-­added
service infrastructure remains high. In the
same vein, regional integration offers still

untapped opportunities for further efficiency
gains and growth (box 2.1).
In terms of other forms of transportation,
railway and air transport are important contributors to Panama’s logistics success while
roads are the weakest link. The Canalrailway corridor plays an important complementary function in the feeder service
scheme of Panama’s transshipment ports,
linking the Atlantic and Pacific seaports on a
75-kilometer stretch along the Canal. Most
of the ships passing through the Canal have
their dedicated feeder services for either the
American west or east coast and stop only
once at either an Atlantic or Pacific transshipment port. Air transport is one of
Panama’s fastest growing sectors, contributing around US$1 billion to the country’s
GDP and creating over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. This is the result of having positioned Panama’s Tocumen International
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

Airport as a major regional passenger hub
for connecting passengers between North,
Central, and South America. Air passenger
volumes have tripled from 2003–2013 as has
international passenger traffic, growing from
2.1 million to 7.7 million during the same
period, of which 50 percent are transit passengers (the national carrier COPA has the
main market share). Contrary to its excellent
position in ports and airports infrastructure
(figure 2.9), Panama ranks 48th in quality of
road infrastructure.8 Road density (190 miles
of roads per one square kilometer of territory) is, together with that in Nicaragua, the
lowest in Central America. Due to Panama’s
geographic location and the concentration of
logistics around the Canal zone, 71 percent
of all main routes are short-haul. Truck utilization is quite low, with a high percentage
(50 percent) of empty backhauls and one of
the highest wait times in Central America
29

Box 2.1

Regional Integration in Central America

The integration of markets and infrastructure networks has extraordinary power to
stimulate growth through efficiency gains, technology spillovers, and investment.
However, despite several notable bright spots in economic cooperation, the promise of
greater regional integration among the Central American countries has remained largely
unfulfilled.
Central America’s efforts at forming greater regional economic ties have been ongoing for
decades, most notably on the trade side stretching from the establishment of a Central
American Common Market in the 1970s to the Dominican Republic–Central America
Free Trade Agreement and the EU–Central America Free Trade Agreement. But there
have also been several significant integration successes outside of trade, including in the
energy sector with the Sistema de Interconexión Eléctrica de los Países de América Central
(SIEPAC), a transmission line project which came into being in June 2013 and connects
the electricity grids of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Panama. That interconnection could enhance investment opportunities for large-scale
renewable energy projects, as well as improve the efficiency and the security of electricity
supply in Central America. Financial interconnectedness is also on the rise, with almost
all the banks in the region expanding operations into neighboring countries, although
differences in legal and regulatory frameworks have limited greater connectedness.
But by and large, Central America has not realized the gains expected from integration
efforts. Exporters have not experienced appreciable growth in either export lines or
markets since the signing of the regional free trade agreements. Bilateral trade in Central
America remains an agenda of largely untapped opportunities, as evidenced by the
negative elasticity of bilateral trade to different factors including adjacency and time-adjusted distance. This untapped potential can be attributed to deficiencies in infrastructure,
burdensome processes, and congestion at the border crossings limiting trade, even where
distances are short. Poor road quality, particularly on secondary and unpaved rural roads,
has led to road transport prices averaging 17 cents per ton-kilometer in Central America,
one of the highest road transportation costs in the world. Burdensome customs procedures, lack of regulatory harmonization (for example in terms of phytosanitary standards
for agricultural exports), few established trade links, an atomized shipping industry,
sparse information sharing on cargo and backhaul in trucking, and relatively few options
and competition for shipping also limit the gains from free trade agreements. Transport
and logistics costs can surpass 50 percent of the final price of goods traded, and it has
been estimated that intraregional exports in Central America could have doubled if the
region achieved the adjacency and time distance factors of a truly integrated region.

(0.05h/km). Security costs are above the
Central American average, amounting to
­almost US$600 per vehicle in 2011 (a 27
percent increase compared to 2008).
In terms of sectoral composition,
growth has mainly stemmed from the transport and communications, financial services,
commerce and construction sectors (Figure
2.10). In the past decade, services have accounted for more than 50 percent of GDP
growth, boosted by transport and communication (explaining on average 1.8 percentage
points of growth between 2001 and 2013)
and financial and business services (explaining 1.7 percent). Commerce, a traditional
growth contributor, has recently contributed
less as a consequence of external conditions
(1.4 percent on average between 2003 and
2011 versus 1.2 percent between 2012 and
13). In addition, construction has become
one of the key drivers of the economy due to

larger investment (both public and private)
in residential and non-residential infrastructure (1.9 percent contribution over the past
five years). Another emerging growth driver
has been hotels and restaurants (0.3 percent
contribution over the past five years). In contrast, the contributions of agriculture and
manufacturing have declined (from 0.2 and
0.3 percent respectively in 2005 to 0.1 and
0.1 in 2013).
Panama has continued to develop its position as an international financial center.
The country has established itself as a major
offshore banking center, hosting 80 banks
with total assets of approximately US$112
billion, nearly three times the size of the
country’s GDP. Most of the country’s financing needs are met by the banking sector and
not by equity or bond markets.9 The competitive and sophisticated banking sector of
Panama has shown that it is agile and

capable of adapting to a rapidly changing
environment. The financial sector has a long
tradition in Panama, preceding the Canal
devolution. Its contribution to economic
growth has been larger than those of traditional sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing. The banking sector of Panama is
widely regarded as healthy and sound. Most
banks in Panama are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, with nonperforming loans
at very low levels. The sector has been
driven by investment in logistics and transport, construction, and commerce, and by
an increasing private consumption boosted
by solid domestic demand. As a result,
mortgage lending represents the largest
share of total private credit in Panama at 30
percent, followed by commerce (19 percent
32

including Canal-related export activity and
tourism) and consumer credit (16 percent).
Mortgage lending has been growing slightly
faster than GDP over the last few years, but
the lack of data on real estate prices and the
resulting absence of loan-to-value ratios represent a significant information gap for effective prudential management and
supervision. Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence
suggests that a doubling of urban real estate
prices over the past five years has been
roughly in line with the rapid pace of GDP
growth.
Although commerce has been one of the
traditional growth drivers, its contribution
has shrunk recently because of external factors affecting the trade of the Colón Free
Zone. Commerce has been driven by retail
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

sales as a result of the increase in
Panamanian incomes and the expansion of
malls and commercial stores and by wholesale sales, mainly from the Colón Free
Zone. The Colón Free Zone is a giant bazaar
cum container port where companies from
across the world—many from East Asia
where 65 percent of the merchandise originates—can market their products to buyers
from the region, saving the latter the inconvenience of traveling to Asia and of stockpiling parts. This cluster has become a
significant financial center serving, in particular, clients in Columbia and República
Bolivariana de Venezuela as well as other
parts of Latin America. In the last two
years, the exports-import activity declined
as a consequence of lower sales to the
Dominican Repbulic, Puerto Rico, and
República Bolivariana de Venezuela and the
deceleration of sales to Colombia. Sales to
República Bolivariana de Venezuela declined due to the problems of that country
in accessing foreign exchange markets,
while sales to Colombia remained stagnant
due to increasing tariffs on textile and shoes
exports.
The construction sector has been an important growth driver in recent years
and created most of the new employment
between 2007 and 2012, especially for lowskill workers. Over the past decade, construction exhibited strong growth
explained by vigorous private investment
in residential projects and public infrastructure projects, such as the expansion of
the Panama Canal and the construction of
line 1 of the Panama City Metro. In addition, in recent years, construction of hotels
and storage has also contributed to the sector. Related indicators, such as concrete
and cement production, have also exhibited
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

vigorous growth. Overall, construction has
grown on average 21 percent per year in
the last five years, contributing two percentage points of GDP. Meanwhile, the sector contributed 17 percent of total growth
in employment. It is very likely that in the
last decade there has been a migration of
agricultural workers from the provinces to
Panama City to work in the sector.
Construction is, after agriculture, the sector with the highest share of employees
who have completed only secondary education or less (figure 2.11).
The role of agriculture and manufacturing for growth has decreased, although agriculture remains a key source of income for
the bottom 40 percent. While still growing in
absolute terms, the shares of both agriculture
and manufacturing have declined in total
GDP due to the strong growth of other sectors. The share of agriculture dropped from
seven percent of GDP in 2000 to three
percent in 2013, and manufacturing declined
from 10 percent to five percent. While agriculture accounts for only a small share of
GDP, it employs 17 percent of the workforce
and has contributed to poverty reduction because it employs a large share of the bottom
40 percent (see Figure 1.5). Main products
include rice and beans for domestic consumption and bananas, plantains, shrimp,
sugar, pineapples, watermelons, and coffee
for exportation. In terms of manufacturing,
the textile industry is declining and the
growth prospects of other industries, such as
food processing, construction materials, and
chemicals, are dim.
Panama is richly endowed with natural
capital and has used it sustainably; nonetheless, the mining sector accounts for a small
share of GDP so far although it could expand
further in the future. Between 2008 and

2012, the sector grew 14 percent, averaging
two percent of the country’s GDP. In 2011
and 2012, gold was the top export of
Panama, totaling US$117 million and
US$116 million, respectively. By 2013, the
mining sector was producing US$553 million or two percent of Panama’s GDP.
Construction materials accounted for most
of this production, while gold production
and exports started declining, down to
US$66 million in 2013 and to only US$38
million in the first quarter of 2014 (a 97
percent drop vis-à-vis the same period in
2013), due in large part to a significant decline in gold prices that made production
uneconomical.
34

The Increasing Role of
Public Investment
Investment has played a prominent role
in Panama’s growth in recent years, supporting a shift of the country’s growth model towards domestic demand (figure 2.12).
Although private consumption has been an
important driver of growth (contributing on
average 4.2 percentage points since 2001), the
contribution of net exports has fluctuated
with external conditions. During the period
from 2004 to 2008, net exports contributed
significantly to overall growth through high
export growth in services (accounting for
2.8 percentage points of overall growth).
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

During the crisis year 2009, net exports contributed positively to growth based on the
significant contraction of imports. In the
postcrisis years, the contribution of net exports to growth has been moderate as the expansion of imports exceeded that of exports.
While investment, both public and private,
contributed only around one percentage
point to overall growth between 2001 until
2009, its contribution doubled thereafter, offsetting the lower contribution of net exports.
Gross investment reached almost 30 percent
of GDP in 2013 (figure 2.14).
The increased contribution of public investment to growth has been backed by an
ambitious public investment program and
the Panama Canal expansion. The share of
public investment in GDP increased from
3.1 percent in 2001 to 13.7 percent in 2013.
In 2010, the government launched a public
infrastructure program comprising more
than 100 projects such as highway upgrades;
roads enlargement and upgrade in Panama
City; airport infrastructure upgrades in six
airports (including Tocumen Airport); a cold
chain to support agriculture activity and reduce losses in the sector; the Panama Canal
expansion; Metro line 1 and a Metro bus system in Panama City; Panama City Bay remediation; improvement in the sanitation
services, hospitals, and 21 health care centers; Curundu urban renovation; 10 air naval
stations; and four new prisons, among others. The total investment of the program is
estimated at US$16.7 billion with an overall
execution above 80 percent.10 The Panama
Canal expansion project amounts to US$5.2
billion and is currently planned to be finalized by the end of 2015. In addition, according to the government, this program was
expected to generate at least 100,000 new
jobs.
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

FDI and Private
Investment
FDI has financed a large part of this infrastructure investment and remains the
largest source of external finance of the current account deficit (figure 2.12). Panama
has been successful in attracting FDI inflows
from a group of diversified economies from
all over the world. In general, FDI has gained
in importance in Panama since the late
1990s, and in the last decade it reached the
current high level in excess of 10 percent of
GDP. These buoyant FDI inflows have financed on average 80 percent of the current
account deficit in the last three years. The average of the deficit on the current account of
the balance of payment increased from
US$942 million in 2003–2007 to US$3,962
million in 2010–2012. The main reason for
the expansion of the deficit is a large increase
in investment from an average of US$3,212
million in 2003–2007 to US$8,571million in
2010–2012, although this was partly compensated for by an increase in savings from
US$1,818 million in 2003–2007 to US$4,307
million in 2010–2012.
As a consequence, Panama’s growth rate
is highly dependent on FDI (figure 2.13).
A one percent increase in the FDI to GDP
share has a short-term impact on real GDP
growth equivalent to 0.63 percentage points
and a long-term effect equal to 0.79 percentage points; in fact, 56 percent of the variance
in the growth rate is explained by FDI.
FDI and private investment more generally have increased due to a favorable and
improving business environment. FDI
­inflows increased from nine to 11 percent of
GDP between 2010 and 2013 and private
­investment from 13 to 16 percent. As
­mentioned before, Panama is a top

The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

performer in Latin America in the Global
Competitiveness Report and has managed to
improve its ranking in the Doing Business
Indicators, moving up to 55th (fifth in Latin
America in 2014) from 79th overall in 2007.
Panama has been successful in attracting
headquarters of foreign companies to
Panama City. Under the SEM (Sedes de empresas multinacionales) program (also called
Law 41) established in 2007, Panama created
a new incentive regime (made up mainly of
fiscal, labor, and migratory benefits) to attract foreign companies to Panama, similar
to the regimes implemented in Singapore
and Switzerland. These benefits are complemented by Panama’s position as a logistics
hub, its connectivity and well-developed infrastructure, its solid banking center, and its
dollar-based economy. Maersk Cargo, one of
the most important cargo shipping companies in the world, was the first company to
take advantage of this law and established its

regional headquarters in the country in
2007. Maersk was followed by Procter &
Gamble (2007); LG, Roche, Caterpillar,
Western Union, and Halliburton (2008);
Phillips, Cemex, Pan American Life, and
Nestle (2009); Sab Miller, Otis, Ericsson,
and Sanofi (2010); Unilever, Johnson &
Johnson, Baxter, Merck, Van Oord, and
Huawei (2011); Belcorp, General Electric,
L’Oreal, Diageo, and 3M (2012); and Hino,
Ace Limited, and Neptune (2013), among
others. As of 2014, there are more than 100
companies under this regime, and they have
in turn invested almost US$600 million in
Panama and currently employ about 5,000
workers.
FDI has flowed into a large range of
­sectors, with an emphasis on services. To
date, FDI inflows are concentrated in service
sectors, such as commerce, transport, and
communications, and the financial services
(figure 2.15). The sectoral composition of

FDI in Panama more closely resembles some
of the Caribbean countries, rather than other
Latin American economies.
While the increase in investment led to
an expansion of imports, mostly of investment goods, Panama’s exports have grown
more slowly and were concentrated in services. Public and private construction projects generated a need for investment goods,
goods that were imported (figure 2.16). At
the same time, Panama’s exports are oriented toward services, unlike those of many
other upper-middle-income countries. In
the period from 2001 to 2013, exports of
services were on average 62 percent of total
exports (figure 2.17). These services included mainly transport and travel, representing more than 75 percent of the total
export of services. Transport is directly
linked to Canal services, and its share has
remained steady in the recent past.
Meanwhile, travel has increased its share as
a consequence of the increasing number of
tourist arrivals (which by 2012 exceeded 1.6
million), coming mainly from Colombia,

República Bolivariana de Venezuela, and
the United States. Panama’s main export
goods are textiles, chemicals, and machinery and electric goods, and are sold primarily to Colombia, República Bolivariana de
Venezuela, and the United States. Panama’s
export markets are diversified and not concentrated (in 2011, the Herfindahl index
was 0.08).
Moreover, the increase in investment in
physical capital has been accompanied by
an increase in the labor force and in total
factor productivity, each explaining around
a third of economic growth between 2001
and 2012 (figure 2.18). These results have to
be interpreted with care because the methodology used biases the estimate of total
factor productivity upward.11 Despite this
upward bias and subsequent uncertainty
about the size of the contribution of total
factor productivity, its increase is consistent
with the structural change observed in
Panama. Workers from the agricultural sector moved into urban sectors, and the share
of better-paid services expanded, suggesting

that resources were allocated more efficiently among sectors.
Labor productivity has increased as well,
displaying stark differences across sectors
(figure 2.19). Overall, labor productivity increased by 27 percent between 2007 and
2012. The main services sectors—financial
services and transport and communication,
which are capital-intensive—are the more
productive activities, with productivity well
above the overall average. Meanwhile, productivity in construction, a labor-intensive
sector whose contribution to growth and job
creation has been important, is just under
half of the total productivity of the economy.
Differences in productivity are also linked to
skill mismatches and the low level of skills of
people employed in labor-intensive activities.
For instance, only nine percent of the total
workers in the construction sector have attained a postsecondary education, while in
personal services this figure is 29 percent,
and in financial and real estate activities this

number is almost five times the construction
figure.12
Job creation has been concentrated in
the Province of Panama. Almost two-thirds
of the net job gain in Panama between
2000 and 2010 occurred in the Province of
Panama, mainly in the commerce, construction, and services sectors. Chiriquí
and Coclé followed with nine and eight
percent of net job growth, respectively. It is
worth noting that job creation for each of
these sectors in the Province of Panama is
larger than total job creation in any of the
other provinces. Agriculture activity exhibits a loss of almost 9,000 jobs, the only sector with negative net job creation. Chiriquí
and the Comarca Ngäbe Buglé showed the
largest losses. It is very likely that the
booming construction services sector has
attracted workers from all over the country,
mainly from rural areas, thus contributing
to a reduction in the agricultural labor
force.

39

Panama’s Stable
Macroeconomic
Environment
Another factor in Panama’s strong
growth performance was the country’s stable
macroeconomic framework. Macroeconomic
stability in Panama is based on full dollarization, fiscal policy that follows a fiscal rule,
and a healthy banking sector. Dollarization
dates back to a monetary convention signed
with the United States following Panama’s independence from Colombia in 1903 and coinciding with the beginning of the Panama
Canal construction. Given the lack of independent monetary policy, fiscal policy plays
a crucial role in stabilizing the economy.
And Panama has adapted the social and fiscal responsibility law in 2002 that mandates
fiscal deficit ceilings to help maintain fiscal
prudence. According to the latest
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article
IV Consultation (“Panama Article IV,” June
2014), most local banks have a traditional
business model with limited wholesale funding, and are well capitalized, profitable, and
liquid. The system showed its resilience during the 2008 global financial crisis.
As a result, fiscal deficits have been kept
in check despite the high public investment
and a low tax revenue collection. As discussed above, public investment has been
stepped up significantly in recent years, and
Panama has been characterized by relatively
low tax revenues. Despite the recent tax reform program implemented in 2009 and
2010, tax revenue reached 12.0 percent of
GDP in 2013. It averaged 11.9 percent of
GDP in the last three years, below the average of 13.4 percent in Central America and
the world average of 17.3 percent. Revenues
40

from the Canal are a significant non-tax
­revenue source for the central government,
representing over 10 percent of total government revenues. While dividends and fees
from the Panama Canal and other non-tax
revenues added another 4.8 percentage
points of GDP in 2013 to the central government’s current revenues, they are low by international standards. Nevertheless, fiscal
deficits remained relatively low amounting to
−2.1 percent in 2011, −1.5 in 2012, and −3
percent 2013 (overall fiscal balance excluding the Panama Canal Authority).
In recent years with particularly high
growth rates, inflation rose slightly and has
moderated with the reacceleration of
growth rates leading to a gradual real exchange rate appreciation. Inflation peaked
at around six percent in 2011 and has since
come down to levels around three percent.
As these rates have been higher than the inflation rate in the United States since the
economy took off in 2003, the inflation differential has led to a gradual real appreciation with modest consequences for
Panama’s competitiveness.
Panama continued the downward trending of its debt-to-GDP ratio. The ratio of
public debt to GDP (including external debt
contracted for the Panama Canal expansion) fell from about 66 percent in 2005 to
about 41 percent in 2013. To encourage the
development of domestic capital market,
the authorities have also increased local
debt issuance. Its efforts have been awarded
by all credit rating agencies. Panama
achieved investment grade in the spring of
2010, and the rating has further improved
in 2012. In April 2013, all three agencies
confirmed Panama’s BBB rating, one notch
above investment grade, on par with Brazil,
Mexico, and Peru.
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

Outlook
There are good reasons to expect that
growth will continue to be strong in Panama
(six to seven percent) in the near future. The
completion of major infrastructure projects
(Canal expansion and the first Metro line)
will lower public investment in the coming
years; however, this will be offset by the
planned construction of the second Metro
line, and the additional traffic generated by
the expanded Canal. Further, there is no suggestion of a downturn in private investment,
according to leading indicators of residential
and non-residential construction.
Construction permits in the first half of 2014
reached 7,268 (equivalent to US$1,155 million of new construction). This represents a
similar number of construction permits to
that in the first half of 2013 (7,254) but an
increase in value of 20 percent.
The prospects of sustained high growth in
the coming years are also supported by
emerging opportunities in key sectors such
as transport and logistics, mining, financial
services, and tourism. The transport and logistics sector is already one of the most important and dynamic sectors in the economy
and is expected to remain a main contributor
to growth. The higher volume of cargo passing through the expanded Canal will by itself
increase the demand for related transport
and logistics services. In addition, major
business opportunities in the next few years
are related to private transport infrastructure
and the development of value-added logistics
services. For example, the private sector is
lining up investments of around US$600
million to expand existing port terminals
and US$300 million to construct a new container terminal in the Pacific. Special economic zones and several logistics parks for
The Nature of Panama’s Economic Growth

warehousing and other services are also
being developed. The recently started expansion of other transport and logistics subsectors—for example, air transport, roads, and
railroads—is expected to continue. Among
these, Tocumen airport is currently undergoing an expansion with a total investment of
about US$700 million, and the road network
is being modernized.
Although the mining sector could turn
into a major driver of growth in the near future, it is subject to uncertainties. The largest
business opportunity is the Cobre Panama
project owned by Minera Panama, which is
80 percent foreign owned by Canada-based
First Quantum Minerals. This project alone
could involve about US$10 billion in investment over the first ten years. Over a projected 30-year life, it could also contribute
US$7 billion to the Panamanian economy in
the form of royalties and taxes, create 10,000
new jobs and over 2,000 temporary jobs
(from 3,780 in 2013, or 0.2 percent of the
country’s employees), and make US$1.5 billion in wage payments and US$800 million
in social security payments. Uncertainties on
the future outlook of the sector relate to the
uncertain levels of global demand for minerals with effects on prices and the actual size
of the underground deposits. Moreover, political, social, and environmental factors add
to the complexities (this issue is further developed in Chapter 6).
Panama has the most dynamic banking
sector in the Central American region, and
the banking sector is expected to continue to
support GDP growth. On the one hand, the
projected growth in the logistics and transport sector is expected to raise demand for
funds for new investment projects. On the
other hand, high growth is raising
Panamanians’ income, increasing the
41

opportunities for bank intermediation. In
addition, the diversification of the economy
into new growth sectors will increase the relevance of alternatives to bank finance. In addition, business opportunities are emerging
in the insurance and reinsurance markets.
The insurance market’s penetration is low in
regional comparison, and Panama seeks to
position itself as a reinsurance hub for Latin
America.
Tourism is an important sector for
Panama. The total contribution of the travel
and tourism sector to GDP was about 14
percent of GDP in 2013 and, according to
the World Travel and Tourism Council, is
expected to increase by seven percent in
2014 and continue to grow by 6.3 percent
annually over the next decade. This growth
will be supported by transport improvements (for example, the expansion of
Tocumen) as well as a series of grants and
incentives to invest in tourism facilities
(more than US$100 million are in the

pipeline to build new hotels in the next three
years in Panama City, Chiriquí, Los Santos,
and Bocas del Toro).

Filling Knowledge Gaps
There are several sectors that are promising drivers of growth going forward. A
thorough analysis of different growth scenarios would support present day decision-­
making. There are uncertainties about the
sectoral composition of growth and the lack
of knowledge about the channels through
which poverty reduction and shared prosperity would be affected. A promising tool to fill
this knowledge gap would be a computable
general equilibrium model. Such a model
would provide insights into the trade-offs between investing in different public services. It
would also provide information on the channels through which different scenarios would
affect growth, employment, and ultimately
poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

billion corresponded to the private sector,
mostly corporate bonds, and the remainder
was domestically issued public debt. Equity
represented just US$400 million.

10. The frequent use of turnkey contracts may underestimate the total investment.
11. The estimation of total factor productivity
was done using a stock of capital that does
not properly adjust for the recovery of the
Canal Zone in 1999. The reason is that the
capital stock is constructed using the perpetual inventory model and there is no adjustment for the handover of the Canal.

However, the impact of the transfer of the
Canal to Panama on the GDP is properly
accounted for (appearing under transport,
storage, etc.). As a result of this inconsistency, the estimate of total factor productivity is biased upward.

occupations ranging from legal services and
bookkeeping to housekeeping.

3. Prioritization Linked to Growth
The goal of the Strategic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) is to identify the most
critical factors constraining or driving growth.
The diagnostic of growth in the previous chapter presents the first step in identifying priority
areas and concrete opportunities for actions
that Panama could take to increase the probability of continued growth and contribution to
welfare. In this chapter the next steps in the
prioritization process are presented along with
their key results.

Benchmarking the
Determinants of Growth
To identify the constraints to Panama’s
continued growth, a variety of methods were
used, including cross-country benchmarking,
perceptions data from enterprise surveys, and
microanalysis. The purpose of this exercise
was to understand which determinants of
growth are the most binding, and to identify
not only the areas that are holding countries
back but also those that could have the highest impact on growth.

Cross-country benchmarking

Cross-country regressions have been commonly used to identify the determinants of
growth. Growth regressions are used to identify which of a large number of factors are
statistically and economically significant determinants of growth rates. Cross-country
growth regressions provide a useful input for
the analysis. Of particular interest are studies
that not only estimate the determinants of
growth but also benchmark the performance
Prioritization Linked to Growth

of individual countries in Latin America for
each of the explanatory variables. In this regard, two sources are particularly useful. The
first one is a study of economic growth in
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) by
Loayza et al. (2004). The second one is a
forthcoming LAC regional study by Araujo
et al., which updates and builds on the work
by Loayza et al. (2004) and increases the
sample in terms of country coverage and
time period.
In a first step, these analyses provide an
estimate of the impact of the explanatory
variables on economic growth in a large
panel of countries, taking into account potential sources of biases. The analyzed explanatory factors include transitional convergence
(initial gross domestic product [GDP]); cyclical reversion (initial output gap); structural
policies in areas such as education, financial
depth, or public infrastructure; and stability
policies, such as lack of price stability or cyclical volatility. In both cases, the impact of
these factors on economic growth is analyzed
relying on system General method of moments (GMM) estimation, an econometric
estimation technique that takes into account
unobserved country-specific effects and joint
endogeneity of the explanatory variables
(growth drivers) with the dependent variable
(economic growth) in a dynamic model of
panel data. Loayza et al. (2004) use an unbalanced panel of 78 countries with non-overlapping five-year observations that span the
period from 1961 to 1999. Araujo et al.
(forthcoming) expand the sample to 126
countries using five-year non-overlapping

The estimation results can give a sense of
the relative importance of the factors behind
growth; however, important limitations of the
approach have to be taken into account. First,
as for any econometric estimation, the results may be biased due to omitted variables;
second, instruments used for the GMM estimation may be mis-specified; and third, the
proxies for the explanatory factors may not
adequately capture the actual concept that is
being analyzed. Given these limitations, the
results from the econometric analysis are
cross-­checked with additional types of analysis and country-specific knowledge to form a
plausible overall picture.
In a second step, a benchmark exercise is
carried out to explore the growth that a coun­
try could have achieved if it were a top performer in terms of each of the explanatory
variables. This type of counterfactual exercise highlights the areas with the largest impact on per capita income for a given country.
This is the approach followed by both Loayza
et al. (2004) and Araujo et al. (forthcoming),
although with slightly different specifications.
The scenarios studied in Loayza et al. (2004)
correspond to a hypothetical situation in
which the determinants of growth in each
country would improve to be on par with the
top 25 percent of the countries. In Araujo et
al. (forthcoming), one of the scenarios considered corresponds to an improvement in
the determinants of growth to the 90th percentile of LAC. This helps determine the possible effects that a stellar performance (relative
to the rest of LAC) in specific policy-sensitive areas might have had for a country’s level
of GDP per capita. In addition, Araujo et al.
(forthcoming) consider the impact on GDP
per capita if the determinants of growth were
to improve to the average levels observed in
OECD countries.
46

The analysis by Loayza et al. (2004) suggests that infrastructure, education, and the
government burden are significant constraints
to growth in Panama. In contrast, stabilization policies, financial depth and external
conditions appear insignificant.1 The authors
also find that increases in trade openness
would positively impact growth in Panama.
However, this finding likely overstates the
possible impact of these policies in the case
of Panama because the proxy used for trade
openness in the regression analysis refers to
trade in goods, while Panama is a country
that exports services rather than goods. The
fact that stabilization policies, financial depth,
and external conditions as measured by terms
of trade shocks are insignificant is consistent
with Panama’s having performed very well in
these dimensions in the past.2
The analysis by Araujo et al. (forthcoming) suggests that infrastructure and education are significant constraints to growth in
Panama. The results of the exercise indicate
that Panama’s GDP per capita would have
been higher with more improvements in infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, education.
Govern­ment consumption also appears as an
area where Panama would benefit from improved policies. In particular, current expenditures appear large compared to the levels
observed in the best-performing countries.
The authors do not find a significant impact
on growth had Panama improved its performance in public sector institutions. However,
this finding likely understates the importance
of improving institutions, since the variable
used in the model to proxy institutions is a
measure of the degree of political competition and political constraints rather than a
measure of the effectiveness or efficiency of
public institutions. As in the case of Loayza
et al. (2004), there is no significant impact on

growth from an improvement in variables related to macroeconomic stabilization, reflecting the fact that Panama has already achieved
a high degree of macroeconomic stability, as
shown in figure 3.2.

Perception data

Microeconomic survey data can provide further insights into the key constraints to growth.
Data collected through the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) in particular provides a
wealth of information about the expe­rience of
firms and what may prevent them from growing.3 The Enterprise Surveys, two of which
were conducted for Panama (2006 and 2010),
provide useful data on the perceptions of firms
about what they experience as key constraints
to growth. Perception data from the WBES

suggest a number of areas that are to some
­extent aligned with the results of the cross-­
country benchmarking. This is particularly the
case for the lack of an adequately educated
workforce (education in the cross-­country
benchmarking) and electricity (infrastructure
in the cross-­country benchmarking).
47

Firm-level micro data

But Enterprise Surveys provide much more
than just perception data. A second type of
data collected in these surveys is objective in
nature. This data relates to both firm performance (for example, sales, employment, and
productivity) and investment climate constraints (for example, how much a firm pays
in bribes, as opposed to the perception of a
given respondent on the extent of corruption).
The availability of these objective measures
helps nuance some of the findings. For example, in the case of corruption—one of the
top two obstacles—the 2010 Enterprise Survey shows that the percentage of firms that
pay bribes is relatively small. Thus, the Graft
Index, a composite index of corruption that
reflects the proportion of times a firm was
asked or expected to pay a bribe when soliciting six different public services, permits, or
licenses, is similar to the LAC average. Corruption perception has increased, however,
and now Panama ranks 102nd of 175 countries, while in 2001 it ranked 52nd. Although
this information does not solve the disconnect between a high perception of corruption
and relatively average objective indicators of
bribing, it suggests that other factors may well
be affecting the perception of corruption.
The econometric analysis of firm-level
data helps to shed light on the areas that
would have most impact on growth. Because
of the availability of objective measures of
firm performance and of the seriousness of investment climate constraints, it is possible to
estimate econometrically the relationship between investment climate characteristics and
firm productivity. This is the exercise that
Fajnzylber et al. (2010) undertake using a
pooled sample of more than 10,000 firms
from across Latin America. Similar caveats

48

apply as mentioned for the econometric analysis of the benchmarking part of the analysis.
Results from the microeconometric analysis suggest that regulatory compliance, security, and infrastructure quality are the
areas that would have the most impact.
Fajnzylber et al. (2010) estimate that improvements in regulatory compliance would
have the most impact on the productivity of
Panamanian firms. Regulatory compliance
captures the effect of regulation and institutional quality and is proxied by three variables
that are likely to be a reflection of excessive
or arbitrarily enforcement of rules and regulations. Inter­estingly, infrastructure quality is
proxied in this analysis by firms’ losses
causes by electricity outages.

Synthesis

The different sources of evidence suggest a
broadly consistent set of areas that include
infrastructure, education, and public sector
institutions. The cross-country benchmarking exercise concluded that improvements
would mainly come from infrastructure and
education. The analysis of microeconomic
survey data highlighted regulatory compliance and security (both of which relate to the
effectiveness of public sector institutions) and
the quality of infrastructure (see table 3.2 for
an overview).

comparisons. Panama is one of the most competitive countries in the region on infrastruc­
ture developments, such as roads, ports, and
airports, according to the Global Competitiveness Ranking prepared by the World Eco­
nomic Forum (Schwab and Sala-i-Martin
2014). Panama has positioned itself in the last
decade as a foreign trade and logistics hub
due to the development of infrastructure and
services for the different modes of transport,
with the Panama Canal at the center. Moreover, according to the World Economic Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (Schwab and Salai-Martin 2014), the quality of Panama’s port
infrastructure performance exceeds that of
other countries in the LAC region and is sim­
ilar to that of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong SAR, China. In addition,
overall infrastructure has improved in recent
years boosted by the government’s ambitious
public investment program. Of particular
impor­tance are the Panama City-Colón high­
way, the Metro line, and upgrades to airports.
However, certain infrastructure components appear to have lagged behind, such as
urban connectivity and, most strikingly, energy. The ability of various segments of society
to access job and market opportunities in a
cost-effective manner is critical for

broad-based economic growth. Metropolitan
areas face congestion and connectivity challenges, particularly in the lower-income
neighborhoods on the outskirts of Panama
City (Choloma and Araihan). Panama’s capacity to invest in and manage urban development has not kept pace with the real estate
boom that has taken place over the last decade. Panama City would need to significantly
improve its offering in terms of public spaces,
walkability, and other amenities to compete
with other global cities. In the livability ranking of 140 global cities, Panama’s capital was
listed among ten cities showing the steepest
decline.4 The full impact of the Metro on access and mobility requires a comprehensive
and multimodal integration policy.
The energy sector in particular, has not been
able to keep pace with the growing demand.
The lack of the diversification of power generation has not matched the accelerated increase in demand in the last years.5 Total
in­stalled capacity in Panama is approximately
2,500 MW and is comprised primarily of hydropower (both reservoir and run of river)
and fossil fuel–based generation. However,
given system-wide inefficiencies (including
several power plant failures) and recent
droughts, firm capacity has fallen to as low as

49

1,600 MW, while peak demand reached 1,500
MW, leaving Panama vulnerable to short­ages.
Generation capacity expansion is not the only
cause of the current power sector crisis. The
fact that Panama’s transmission grid has also
failed to keep up with growing demand has
both limited the delivery of elec­tricity from
existing generation assets to distributors and
prevented new power plant con­struction.
With the system unable to meet rapidly growing demands, the government has been
forced to put emergency response measures
in place and the energy shortage experienced
during dry seasons is putting tremendous
pressure on electricity prices.
The underlying reason for the current situation is market distortion due to weak strategic planning, along with subsidies and
inefficiencies in the institutional set up. The
subsidies reduce incentives to invest in efficient power generation, transmission, and
distribution. The government plays a major
role in the transmission market, and the private sector owns the power generation and
distribution assets. The potential expansion of
two interconnection lines to Costa Rica and
Colombia, the latter being the most ­difficult
to execute, are expected to reduce pressures
on the power market. The current subsidies
scheme poses risks on fiscal sustainability and
has heavily distorted the prices of the market,
which in turn has increased the political cost
of modifying the scheme. Electricity costs in
Panama remain among the highest in Central
America despite government subsidies (the
price per KWh for industrial users was 16.95
cents/US$, for commercial users 17.33, and
for residential users 13.83).

Education and skills

Panama has made large gains in education in
recent years, with primary enrollment almost
50

universal and increasing secondary enrollments. Preschool enrollment has also been
expanded, boding well for future educational
attainment. However, the sector faces a number of challenges that may undermine growth
and productivity going forward. Retention in
secondary education is low, and there are con­
cerns about the quality and relevance of the
education system for the present job market.
The demand for highly educated workers
is strong and growing in Panama, yet the system faces significant dropout numbers at the
secondary level. Between 2000 and 2010, the
number of jobs in the country grew by close
to 40 percent. The bulk of the jobs created,
however, required completed secondary or
tertiary education (see ­figure 1.14 in Chapter
1 above). Less than eight percent of all jobs
were filled by those with primary schooling
or less. Despite this strong demand, the enrollment rate in Panama for secondary school­
ing is low. After age 12, enrollments begin to
fall, highlighting the difficulties the system
has in retaining students. The fact that this

pattern has changed very little between 2007
and 2012 is of further concern.
Firms highlight secondary and vocational
education as a binding constraint for the busi­
ness environment. A study of the top business environment constraints (World Bank
2011) found an inadequately educated labor
force to be one of the top three constraints
for developing a business in Panama (figure
3.3). The quality of graduates appears low: in
2009, on the international education tests
(PISA), Panamanian students underperformed
by international standards, having one of the
lowest scores (figure 3.5). No further data exist
as the country pulled out of the tests after 2009.
The expected growth in demand for highskill workers may not benefit Panama citizens if those with the required skills are not
available. Although international migration

is low in Panama at present (four percent of
the population immigrated in the last ten
years), the education levels of many of these
migrants are above those of the national pop­
ulation (figure 3.4).
Dropout rates remain high despite the
high returns to education. Panama exhibits
large positive economic returns to education,
higher than Costa Rica, El Salvador, and
Honduras.6 On the one hand, the opportunity costs of schooling have probably risen:
the massive job creation in recent years has
provided income opportunities for students.
On the other hand, there is a lack of physical
infrastructure at the secondary level: for
many in remote rural areas, access to schooling is still a binding constraint.
Educational quality is a key factor that can
affect retention. Panama spends slightly more

than the average for Latin America (4.2 ­per­cent
of GDP compared to four percent); however,
based on the PISA math and education scores,
Panama’s efficiency of public spending on education is low.7 Panama’s score on the Public
Sector Efficiency Index is only 0.88 compared
to the LAC score of 1.0.8 More­over, Bruns and
Lucque (2015) provide evidence of a drop in
the quality of Panama’s education between
2000 and 2010 that in their measures represents a drop of more than 20 percent in the
efficiency of the sector. Teachers in Panama
work significantly fewer hours than other employees in the economy, with male teachers
having the largest gap in hours.9 Teachers also
earn less than their counterparts in other
countries, due in part to an excess supply of
teachers. There is also some evidence of excess
production of teacher grad­uates with generally
low academic quality. The most recent data for
Panama suggest that only 59 percent
52

of graduates from teacher training schools are
actually working as teachers. On a more positive note, Panama has benefited from smaller
class size: the pupil-teacher ratio is less than 20
to 1, lower than in some high-performing
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries.

Public sector institutions
(including transparency,
efficiency, and regulatory
framework)

There is a mismatch between the sophistication of Panama’s economy and the effectiveness
and efficiency of its public sector institutions.
In terms of institutional quality, Panama significantly lags behind its aspirational peers
(figure 3.6) according to the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Ranking.

Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore rank
8th and 3rd respectively.10 The challenges
Panama faces regarding its public sector institutions can be summarized as relating to
transparency, the regulatory framework, and
efficiency of public sector management.
The challenge of the transparency of
Panama’s public institutions is widely recognized. Government practices are perceived
as relatively non-transparent and the monitoring and evaluation function is weak. The
issues raised by the Global Forum in the OECD
highlight some of the weaknesses. The Corr­
uption Perception Index prepared by Trans­
parency International shows that Panama­nians
perceive their government as more corrupt
in recent years than in earlier periods. More­
over, public trust in politicians is low in
Panama; in 2010, just over half of the
Prioritization Linked to Growth

population expressed positive levels of trust
in the national government and only a third
for the National Assembly (LAPOP 2010).
Panama has demonstrated high levels of
efficiency in the management of the Canal,
efficiency that is not been replicated across
the full public sector. An overarching problem is the inability to translate a strategic vision into implementable policy. Despite sundry
multiyear sectorial strategy documents, the
lack of linkage between the various plans and
of strategic planning, including at the municipal levels, reduces government efficiency
and erodes the foundation for efficient fiscal
management.11 In addition, budget credibility is one of the key public financial management weaknesses in Panama, also affecting
government transparency. The lack of budget
predictability and the difficulty of

realistically defining activities to be executed
during the following year promote improvisation and reduce budget relevance and strategic value because the budget is no longer a
strategic tool of public administration and
planning, but rather becomes a tool for registering commitments and transfers.
Panama’s regulatory framework shows important weaknesses that are apparent in most
sectors of the economy. According to the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Ranking, Panama ranks 69th in efficiency of
legal framework in challenging regulations
out of 144 countries, while Hong Kong SAR,
China and Singapore rank 3rd and 21st respectively. Box 3.1 illustrates some of these
weaknesses in the case of energy.

Identified Opportunities
A series of specific opportunities has
been identified within each of the priority
areas described above, namely energy, education and skills, and public sector institutions. Through the application of a series of
filter and criteria along with consultation
with stakeholders in Panama, a set of opportunities for action were identified.12 These
opportunities are briefly described here
while a detailed description of each opportunity can be found in Appendix C. The explicit links between these opportunities and
their effect on specific sectors in the economy that could turn into future drivers of
growth are outlined as well.

Prioritization Linked to Growth

Identified opportunities in the context of
education and skills include both concrete
policy measures and analytical work to understand the underlying causes of the challenges. The first opportunity consists of
render­ing secondary education in Panama
more relevant for the labor market. This could
be achieved through the introduction of a
vocational training program with participation of the private sector and public sector
coordination. This could also be comple­mented
by a revision of secondary and tertiary education curricula to integrate private sector
needs into the training of young Panamanians.

Box 3.1

A highly relevant action in this regard appears to be the comprehensive introduction
of English into curricula. A second opportunity consists of strengthening the monitoring
and evaluation of education with the goal of
improving the quality. Low-hanging fruit in
this context are participating in the 2015 PISA
testing and analyzing the causes of dropout
from secondary education both by exploiting
existing administrative data and by holding
focus group sessions. Finally, a third opportunity consists of addressing high dropout
rates by expanding the Beca Universal program
through targeted offerings for vulnerable

Institutional Challenges of the Energy Sector

The governance system in the energy sector has been criticized for its lack of proper planning
and weak or limited staffing and institutional capacity. Slow and rarely transparent decision
making is a key factor in the slow pace of investments in energy infrastructure expansion and
strengthening in recent years. Further, existing policies, legislation, and regulations—the rules
of the game—need to be revisited to meet the needs of a modern, expanding, and diversifying
power system that is developing in Panama.
The sector is also characterized by a multiplicity of agencies that are not coordinated. Four
primary institutions constitute the government’s role in the energy sector. (First, the National
Energy Secretariat is the lead national agency that coordinates the actions in the energy and
power sector across ministries and agencies. Second, the National Electricity Transmission
Company (ETESA) is the only participant in the transmission sector. It was created by Law 6
and is the remnant of the Institute of Water and Electrification (IRHE) responsible for managing the state monopoly on the energy sector since 1997. It has the responsibility for expanding
and operating the transmission system, as well as operation of the energy market. Third, the
National Dispatch Center (CND) coordinates the participants in the distribution market. And,
fourth, the National Public Service Authority (ASEP), besides ensuring compliance with
regulation in the electricity sector, is responsible for regulation related to telecommunications,
water delivery, and sewage. In the distribution sector, three private companies control power
distribution: ENSA, Edemet, and Edechi. The Panamanian state owns about 40 percent of the
shares of ENSA, while Edemet and Edechi belong to the Spanish group Unión-Fenosa.

students, including culturally appropriate offerings in indigenous areas.
For energy, opportunities present themselves in the context of short-term demand
manage­ment; the institutional framework;
and power generation, transmission, and
distribution. The first opportunity consists of
the management of national energy demand.
This opportunity could be realized in a short
time frame. In other countries such as Brazil,
these types of short-term demand response
measures led to a 20 percent reduction in demand. The impact in Panama is expected to
amount to a 10 percent reduction. The second opportunity consists of the modernization of the institutional framework of the
56

sector, including improving the coordination
among institutions that are key players in the
sector. The third set of opportunities relates
to the physical infrastructure of energy generation, trans­mission, and distribution: by
adding renewable energy or natural gas
power generation, Panama may mitigate the
risks of power shortages through (i) taking
advantage of their costs being lower than the
existing oil-based generation; (ii) reducing
vulner­ability to droughts associated with
large hydropower plants; and (iii) reducing
dependence on imported fossil fuels. By expanding the number of transmission lines,
electricity flows from existing and planned
power projects will not be limited by the
Prioritization Linked to Growth

capacity for throughput as is currently the
case given the lack of adequate power
transmission.
Opportunities on public institutions relate to transparency and efficiency of public
insti­tutions as well as the adequacy of the
regulatory framework. Two main opportunities emerged in the context of transparency. The first is related to meeting the
standards on tax and financial information
sharing of the OECD; the second is related
to improving public procurement practices,
in particular for large infrastructure projects. In the context of public institution
­efficiency, three further opportunities present themselves. First, a move to performance-based budgeting, ­accompanied by
better coordination among gover­nment
plans and entities, could have major benefits. Second, developing institutional capacity at the municipal level is needed to
support the move toward decentralization.
Improving fiscal management would be the
third opportunity under public institution
efficiency. This is particularly relevant in a
country like Panama that has fully outsourced its monetary policy to the United
States Fed­eral Reserve and that has little
room for fiscal maneuvering because of the
deficit ceiling mandated under the Fiscal
Responsi­bility Law. These strong constraints
on fiscal policy mean that the only way in
which Panama can create fiscal space is
through efficiency gains. Finally, the third
opportunity is to ­improve the adequacy of
the regulatory framework, including the
formulation and adaption of a modern mining regulatory framework, the enforcement
of social and environmental safe­guards regulations, and an update of financial sector
regulations. These actions are part­icularly
relevant for the financial and mining
Prioritization Linked to Growth

sectors, which are promising sectors for the
economy going forward.
The impact of progress on the opportunities identified will vary by sector. Some specific
examples of how these policy opportunities
will affect promising sectors of Panama’s econ­
omy are mentioned here. These examples
draw on the International Financial Corpora­
tion’s private sector expertise in Panama.
Improvements in public sector institutions will help both the mining and financial
sectors of Panama to maintain or increase
their roles as important drivers of growth. To
ensure that the country can take advantage
of the existing mining potential, the formulation and adaption of a modern mining regulatory framework is both an opportunity
and high priority. Overall, the existing mining legal and regulatory framework has not
been updated to incorporate new international standards on effective oversight of
mining activity by the relevant government
and municipal institutions, subnational royalty sharing schemes, and environmental
protection and social responsibility. Even
though the financial sector is well regulated,
transparency could be enhanced by achieving
OECD Global Forum standards that promote
transparency and information exchanges,
thus reducing operational costs and ameliorating systemic risk. Transparency and appropriate regulatory frameworks are also
critical for Panama to launch itself as a reinsurance hub for Latin America, and improvements in the institutional framework
are required to develop the domestic capital
market and expand the role of the
Panamanian Stock Exchange.
For tourism, and the transport and logistics sector, focusing on the priority areas of education and energy will remove existing
barriers to expansion. The large number of
57

planned activities in the transport and logistics
sector will generate new demand for a welltrained labor force that is English-­proficient
and capable of working in a multicultural environment. Tour­ism is also expected to continue to be a significant driver of growth in
Panama; ­investor con­fidence remains high
given the country’s strategic location and stability. The opportunities identified above of
updating the curriculum of the International
Baccalaure­ate and introducing bilingual education will be critical to meeting the new labor
demand of both sectors and improving productivity. The energy sector will need to respond to new demands as well, not simply by
generating more power but by providing
transmission mechanisms to areas presently
under-served. The present saturation of the
hotel market in the capital, for example,
means that new investments will more likely
take place in remote areas and provinces outside of Panama. The opportunities identified

to improve transmission as well as generation
of electricity will prevent energy from becoming a barrier to these sectors.

Filling Knowledge Gaps
There is little data available on coverage and quality of public service delivery
across the country. The role of municipalities
in regulating and providing public services is
fundamental in reaching out to the underserved. Understanding the correlation between weak local governments and access to
and quality of public services in the poorer
geographic regions is critical to promoting
better service delivery. The same is true for
linking spatial data on public social services
to outcomes. A contribution to filling this
knowledge gap could consist of compiling
detailed information (databases) on the
quality and resources of regions, municipalities, and metropolitan areas in Panama.

Notes
1. As is common in the literature, both Loayza
­et al. (2004) and Araujo et al. (forthcoming)
classify the determinants of growth in d
­ ifferent
categories, including structural factors—such
as human capital or infrastructure—and those
determinants of growth that are related to stabilization policies—such as inflation.
2. Similarly, Swiston and Barrot (2011) find limited
opportunities to boost growth given Panama’s
already relatively high performance in the explanatory variables used in their model.

4. Inclusiveness of Panama’s Growth
Panama’s growth has been inclusive
along many dimensions, but the geographic and ethnic distribution of growth
has not been homogenous. Growth has been
strong, averaging 7.2 percent between 2001
and 2013, and above eight percent for five
of the past seven years despite the crises of
2008–09. The bottom forty percent of the
population has benefited from growth more
than has the average Panamanian. Average
income growth among the bottom forty
percent of the population was seven percent
compared to 6.3 percent overall (figure 4.1),
with the resulting fall in overall poverty from
40 to 26 percent of the population and
extreme poverty from 16 to 11 percent (see
Chapter 1). Yet the geographic distribution
of growth has not been homogenous: the

poorest areas, the indigenous territories or
comarcas, continue to lag behind.
The change in the view of night lights in
Panama between 1997 and 2010 underscores
the overall growth performance along with
the remaining geographic inequality, inequality linked to ethnicity (figure 4.2). On the
one hand, economic growth around the Canal
is clearly visible as is the expansion of growth
into the interior in the provinces of Coclé,
Los Santos, and Chiriquí through the spread
of night lights. On the other hand, the continued darkness over substantial sections of
the country reflects regions that have either
benefited only slightly from economic growth,
or were so far behind the others that recent
growth has not been enough for them to catch
up, or regions where there are dispersed populations to whom it is hard to provide services (including but not limited to electricity).
In particular, the indigenous territories are in
areas of the map that have remained without
access to electricity.

Positive Trends
Recent economic growth has led to a
substantial increase in the size of the middle
class. In 2007, the middle class spanned the
69th to 84th centiles of the population; in
2012 it had expanded to encompass the 57th
to 96th centiles of the distribution (figure 4.3).
The share of income going to the middle class
rose from 52.4 to 55.8 percent during the
period (using the definition of middle class
as having per capita income of US$10–50 per
day). The top earners doubled their population share, from one to two percent and saw

their share of total income rise from 10 to 16
percent. The ratio of the share of income of
the top 10 percent of the population over the
remainder of the population has remained at
2.2 percent from 2007 to 2012.

Changes in inequality at the national level,
and within urban areas, have been minimal:
a one percentage point change over five years
(figure 4.4). In contrast, rural inequality has
fallen substantially—four percentage points

Note: Poor is defined as having income below the national poverty line, middle class as having incomes of US$10–50 a day per capita, and
rich as having incomes of more than US$50 per day. In this analysis, the vulnerable are those whose incomes are above the poverty line but
below the middle class and thus face a danger of falling back into poverty.

in five years—although it is still slightly higher
than in urban areas. The decline in rural inequality appears to be driven by increased
public spending in rural areas that reached
the poorest groups along with internal migration: self-selection in migrants lowers the
inequalities in their communities of origin (see
below for a discussion of internal migration).
There has also been substantial progress
on nonmonetary indicators of welfare and
access to services. Life expectancy has risen

steadily, and the country has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) in terms
of child mortality (table 4.1). Although not
expected to reach the MDG goal on maternal mortality, Panama has nonetheless seen
some progress over the last ten years on reducing maternal mortality in the country.
Malnutrition rates have also declined. Progress has been made in measures of welfare
related to service access as well. Enrollment
in education has increased at all levels since
1990, with the biggest gains seen at the
63

preschool and tertiary levels. The average
years of schooling of the population have increased by 1.6 years since 1990 and 0.1 years
since 2005. Access to running water in a dwell­
ing increased from 84 percent in 2000 to 94
percent in 2010; electricity access rose seven

the higher starting point); and access to sanitation, while still limited, rose from 60 to 72
percent between 2005 and 2010 (figure 4.5).

Limitations of Growth’s
Effects
Despite strong and fairly inclusive
growth, differing rates of poverty reduction
have led to the poor becoming ever more con­
centrated in specific geographic locations.
Poverty rates vary tremendously across the
country. In 2012, poverty in the poorest pro­
vince or comarca was 93 percent, with 82
percent of the population living in extreme
poverty (Ngäbe Buglé comarca) (figure 4.7).
In contrast, the province of Veraguas had only
15 percent poverty and only 2 percent of the
population in Herrerra lived in extreme poverty.
These differences are both a result of very
different starting points in terms of poverty
rates and quite different rates of change (figure 4.6). The poorest areas (the comarcas)

saw poverty fall 4.2 percent between 2007 and
2012. In contrast, Coclé, which began with a
substantially lower poverty rate of 56 percent,
saw the greatest fall in poverty (24 percent).
The net effect of these differential changes in
poverty is that, while overall the number of
extremely poor people in the country fell, the
comarcas became home to an ever increasing
share of them: in 2007, 24 percent of all ex­
tremely poor people in Panama lived in the
comarcas, a figure which rose to 42 percent
by 2012 (figure 4.8).
Internal migration may also play a role in
the concentration of poverty both because it
is large and because there is evidence of self-­
selection among migrants. There has been sub­
stantial internal migration in recent years: in
2010, one-fifth of individuals over age 15 lived
in a district that was not the same as where
they had lived ten years previously. The rates
vary little by ethnicity: Afro-descendants are
slightly less prone to migrate (20 percent

having migrated), the indigenous are slightly
more likely (22.6 percent), and the migration
rate for all other groups was 21.6 percent.
Due to data limitations, it is not possible to
look at either the total number of migrants
(many persons may have migrated and then
returned to their previous location in the
ten-year reference period) or trace the full
migration patterns.1 However, the overall
picture is one of movement with a tremendous bias toward the Province of Panama: 67
percent of all migrants moved to there. Among
indigenous migrants, 48 percent moved to
this province compared to 79 percent of
Afro-descendants (figure 4.9).
Internal migrants to the Province of Panama show evidence of being positively self-­
selected: education levels of those migrants
are higher than those of non-migrants (figure
4.10). The difference in education between
migrants and non-migrants is especially pronounced among the indigenous population:

while 47 percent of the non-migrant indigenous adult population had not finished primary school, only 22 percent of the
indigenous migrants to the Province of Panama fell into this category. Among the Afro-descendants and other Panamanian
populations, migrants are more likely to have
completed secondary or tertiary school than
non-migrants, while those who did not finish secondary school are less likely to have
migrated. This pattern of positive self-selection does not hold for migrants to other parts
of the country, perhaps reflecting the greater
66

range of employment offerings for lower-skilled workers. Further evidence of
self-selection comes from the fact that migrants are less likely to be unemployed than
non-migrants (figure 4.11). However, this is
probably also driven by return migration,
unsuccessful migrants being more likely to
return to their place of origin.
There remain wide disparities among various groups and areas in the country (figure
4.12). Geographic differences are large, with
the poor under-represented in urban areas
relative to the population of cities and over-­
represented in rural areas and the comarcas.
In absolute terms, however, urban and rural
areas have similar numbers of poor people at
around 40 percent of the total. The remaining 21 percent of the poor live in the three
largest comarcas. Although there are greater
numbers of poor people in urban areas than
in the comarcas, the urban poor are better off
than their poor counterparts in the comarcas.
Among the urban poor, monthly incomes
are twice as high, the years of schooling of
the head of household are more than double,
a greater share of household members are of
working age, and their school-age children
are more likely to be enrolled in school than
those in the poor households in the comarcas. And the discrepancies are greater among
the extremely poor: the population living in
the comarcas is worse off than other extremely
poor persons in the rest of the country (figure 4.13). Forty-two percent of the extremely
poor live in comarcas, despite that fact that
only six percent of the total population lives
there. The extremely poor in rural areas are
somewhere in between the comarcas and
the urban extremely poor on most indicators
but actually have the highest income per capita per day (at US$1.7 compared to US$1.3
in the comarcas and US$1.5 in urban areas).

Differences by ethnicity are also marked.
Ideally, the data should allow a comparison
among the indigenous population living in
the comarcas, the indigenous population living outside the comarcas, the Afro-descendant
population, and the rest of the population.
However, as discussed in box 1.1, the data
limitations preclude the calculations of comparable poverty rates of the full indigenous
population or that of the Afro-descendants.
The only data source that allows a comparison between these two groups, indigenous
outside of comarcas and Afro-descendants,
is the decennial National Population and
Housing Census. The Census provides data
on several indicators that can serve as proxies for welfare.
68

The indigenous population living outside
of the five comarcas appears to be better off
than their counterparts living in comarcas
(table 4.2).2 Those living outside the comarcas
have much greater access to services, and
their incomes are more than three times as
high. They are also more educated even though
their children have the same enrollment rate
as those in the comarcas. Households tend to
be smaller, with more working age members
and more male-headed households—further
evidence of selectivity in migration. Despite
the fact that indigenous people living outside
the comarcas appear to be doing better in
terms of basic indicators, they still lag behind their nonindigenous counterparts on
all indicators.

In contrast, Afro-descendants, on the indicators for which data exist, appear to be
slightly better off than the population at large
(table 4.2). On average, their access to services is higher, reflecting in part that many
live in the urban areas of Colón and Panama
City. Income levels are also higher as are education levels and school enrollment. However, none of the indicators related to services
reflects the quality of these and there are legitimate concerns about service quality in Colón
and parts of Panama City. Moreover, there is
a concern that, for reasons of stigma, only
the better off and more empowered members
of the group will self-identify as Afro-descendant, which would lead to an over-estimation of welfare among Afro-descendants.3
Inclusiveness of Panama’s Growth

However, with the available quantitative data,
the Afro-descendant population does not appear to be at a particular disadvantage.4
Economic growth has translated into improved access to services, but despite evidence
of convergence, sharp differences remain;
growth has not been enough to fill the gaps.
Between 2000 and 2010, education levels
(enrollment rates) have risen fastest in the
provinces or comarcas with the lowest initial
levels and in the areas with the biggest gap
between males and females; notably, female
enrollments have climbed more quickly than
those of men. The convergence appears similar in terms of access to water with rates of
change higher in the areas that started with
lowest coverage (figure 4.14). Colón is an

outlier here, showing a high rate of change.
In terms of sanitation (sewer connections),
the story is similar for all of the country except
the three comarcas: these areas are almost
completely excluded from access to sanitation (figure 4.15). Institutional factors affect
the provision of public services in water and
sanitation (see box 4.1).
There is a striking correlation between living in a comarca and having little or no access
to water, sanitation or even electricity. Figure
4.16 shows this for running water in the dwell­
ing, with the only exception being Guna Yala.
In part, this reflects the rural nature of the
comarcas and the relatively dispersed populations that live there. However, other rural
areas have better services: in 2008, a child in
70

a comarca had a 35 percent probability of
having access to electricity compared to an
81 percent probability of an average rural
child having electricity, while for sewerage
connections, the numbers were 10 percent
and 35 percent, respectively.5 In short, the
low coverage–comarca link is strong. Interestingly, the other ethnic minority in the coun­
try, the Afro-descendants, do not appear to
be as constrained in terms of services, probably as they are more likely to live in urban
areas.
The disparities in access to services are reflected in the very different social outcomes
observed across the population. In 2013, life
expectancy in the comarcas was estimated to
be between seven and nine years lower than

rates in the Emberá comarca are almost three
times the national average of 15 percent and
are similar to those of Ethiopia.7 Bocas del
Toro also shows poor health indicators and
high dropout rates. The burden of related diarrheal illness in children falls disproportionately on rural and, especially, indigenous
households and is estimated to cause 130 premature deaths and one million cases of diarrhea in children under age five each year.

Box 4.1 How Institutional Challenges Affect Service Delivery in the
WSS Sector
Three main actors are responsible for policy setting, service provision and regulation: (i)
the Ministry of Health through the Directorate of Water and Sanitation (DISAPAS),
responsible for sector policy, coordination, and long-term planning, as well as smaller
towns and rural areas; (ii) the National Water and Sewerage Institute (IDAAN), responsible for urban areas and rural communities with over 1,500 inhabitants; and (iii) the
National Authority for Public Services (ASEP), which supervises and regulates service
provision in urban areas. Multiple other actors play a role in the sector, including the
National Environmental Authority (ANAM) for water quality standards, Autoridad del
Canal de Panama (ACP) for selling bulk water to IDAAN, and the Ministry of the
Presidency for high priority Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) service infrastructure.
On the organizational side, unclear roles of the different agencies hamper effective
regulation, and having multiple implementing agencies for infrastructure provision

impedes coordination. Specialized rural water boards do not receive appropriate technical
support to allow them to run their small systems with adequate cost recovery to ensure
sustainability. Sector policy setting remains disjointed, with DISAPSAS unable to exercise
its full mandate in strategic planning and oversight. This is due to other agencies executing
infrastructure investments in parallel, with no single investment plan for the sector,
leading to overlaps and the lack of a coherent vision. Finally, the regulatory function of
the sector is clearly lacking, compared to other sectors in Panama, such as electricity and
telecommunications. Water tariffs applied by IDAAN are very low and have not been
revised since 1982, which means that if adjusted for inflations tariffs have actually
decreased by about 50 percent since then. With a flat rate for high minimum consumption, even in metered areas, the tariff structure does not encourage water conservation,
resulting in a significant gap in both operations and maintenance as well as investment
needs, making IDAAN highly dependent on budget transfers. This state is further exacerbated by high levels of nonrevenue water (54 percent in the City of Colón) and high
staffing levels (5.3 per thousand water connections) that often lack the technical capacity
for effective service provision and management.
Note: With regard to the regulatory function, in 2014 ASEP drafted only 371 resolutions for the WSS sector, compared to 5578 and
7834 for the electricity and telecommunications sectors respectively. Http://www.asep.gob.pa/.

In addition, fuel wood burning in rural indigenous households is the primary culprit for
acute respiratory illnesses, with an estimated
economic cost of 0.2 percent of GDP. Finally,
children in comarcas are more likely to drop
out of school than either their rural or urban
counterparts: at age 18, only 39 percent of children in the comarcas are in school compared
to 47 percent in rural areas and 69 percent in
urban ones.

Drivers of Poverty
Reduction
The positive effects of economic
growth on poverty reduction came through
a combination of increased labor income and
a strong program of public transfers (figure
Inclusiveness of Panama’s Growth

4.17and figure 4.18). Sources of income that
mattered for poverty reduction varied across
the country and by type of poverty. Labor income was the key driver of overall poverty
reduction in urban areas and the comarcas.
In contrast, government transfers played the
biggest role in poverty reduction in rural
areas. For extreme poverty reduction, labor
income was important only in urban areas:
in rural areas and the comarcas, labor income changes would have increased poverty
in the absence of government transfers.

Labor income

The differential effect of labor income on poverty reduction is due both to the geographic
distribution of job growth and the quality of
those jobs. The patterns of economic growth

are seen in both the number and the types of
jobs that have been created in the past ten
years. As described in Chapter 2 above, job
growth in Panama has been substantial in recent years. However, this has benefited different regions disproportionately. Census data
from 2000 and 2010 show that the bulk of
these new jobs have been in the Province of
Panama (figure 4.19).8 Nonetheless, the comarca Emberá has seen the sharpest job
growth, up 58 percent compared to 43 percent
in Panama (and 49 percent in next fastest
growth province, Darién). In contrast to the
growth in jobs in the comarca Emberá, the
comarca Ngäbe Buglé saw a net loss of jobs
while Guna Yala saw an increase of only 17
percent.
The quality of the jobs created also differs
by region of the country (figure 4.20). The
74

areas with the lowest poverty reduction, the
comarcas, were largely those with low net job
growth. In the comarca Emberá, where job
growth was strikingly high, the majority of
these jobs were in agriculture, typically a low-­
productivity sector in Panama. In fact, almost
half of the new jobs generated in the comarca
Emberá required only a primary education
or less. In contrast, for Coclé, Herrera, and
Los Santos, the provinces with the greatest
poverty reduction between 2007 and 2012,
job growth was much higher (ranging from
26 to 41 percent), and most jobs created in
these provinces were those that required either completed secondary schooling or tertiary studies: 84 percent in Herrarra, 93 percent
in Los Santos, and 73 percent in Coclé.
The net result is continued low levels of
income diversification among the indigenous

populations in the comarcas. Despite a decline, agriculture still provides two-thirds of
labor income in the comarcas compared to
only 44 percent in other rural areas, a dependence that affects welfare gains. Agriculture
is a sector that is shedding jobs and represents
a small share of GDP; moreover, agriculture
productivity is neither growing nor is it even
as high as Latin American averages.9 Why
agriculture has lagged behind is unclear. Given
that returns to other sectors in Panama are
higher, there is probably underinvestment in
agriculture. This reliance on agriculture also
results from the fact that the populations in
the comarcas are physically distant from the
growth corridors of the country and lack other
skills, which may act as a further barrier to
obtaining jobs in other sectors.
76

Internal migration is linked to the uneven
growth of jobs in Panama and migration leads
to greater income diversification.10 The sector of employment among migrants is largely
determined by destination, not ethnicity
(figure 4.21). Between 18 and 25 percent of
migrants who migrated to the Province of
Panama worked in commerce, regardless of
their ethnicity. However, working in hotels,
restaurants, and private households was more
common among indigenous migrants, who
have lower educational attainment than the
other two groups. Construction work is also
under-represented among indigenous migrants, raising questions about barriers to
entry. Those among the indigenous who migrate outside of the Province of Panama are
more likely to work in agriculture: the sector
accounts for more than half of migrant employment outside of the comarcas and the
Province of Panama.
Overall, women have benefited from the
growing job market.11 The rate of growth of
jobs for women has outpaced that for men—
25.6 percent compared to 15.4 percent respectively between 2007 and 2012. Female
labor force participation rose five percentage
points between 2000 and 2012 to reach 53
percent. Unemployment rates for women fell
dramatically as well—from 18 to five percent
in five years between 2007 and 2012, with
the 2012 rate just one percentage point higher
than that of men. The quality of jobs for women
also improved; in 2000 59 percent of all jobs
held by women required complete secondary
education or higher, and by 2010 this had
risen to 69 percent. The share of male jobs
requiring these levels of education was just
45 percent in 2010.12 Female employment in
the informal sector remained lower than that
for men (27 percent compared to 31 percent,
respectively) although the figure for men is

starting to reach that of women on this indicator. The gender income gap in Panama was
the lowest in Latin America in 2010 at 0.90.
However, of concern are the continued occupational segregation of jobs and relatively
low labor force participation rates of women;
the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
average is five percentage points higher than
that of Panama.

Public transfers

Government spending has played a significant role in reducing extreme poverty and
overall poverty in rural areas. Overall spending in the social sectors is similar to that of
Panama’s neighbors: 13.3 percent in Panama
compared to 13.7 percent in Central America. A series of programs and benefits have
been introduced in the past few years. Red de
Oportunidades, the conditional cash transfer
program begun in 2003, is the largest. The pro­
gram consists of four components: (i) conditional cash transfers to beneficiaries contingent
on enrollment of children in school and the
use of preventive health care services; (ii) pro­
vision of the health and education services
required by beneficiaries; (iii) support to fam­
ilies in accessing such services; and (iv) infrastructure improvement. The cash transfer
is designed to mitigate poverty today and, by
increasing human capital, poverty in the future. The 100 a los 70 non-contributory pension program provides a pension to all elderly
persons with no other pension. In 2014, this
was modified to provide US$120 to all persons 65 and older. Finally, the Beca Universal, or universal education benefit, provides
cash transfers to family to encourage school
attendance. The benefit is given contingent
on a student attending school for a given

78

number of days and maintaining a minimum
grade level. The program started as an effort
to lower secondary school dropout rates but
has since been expanded to primary school
as well.
The impact of the Red de Oportunidades
has been positive. A quantitative analysis of
the program found important effects.13 For
rural children ages 12 to 15, the program led
to a 10.2 percentage point increase in school
enrollment and a similar (10.1) decrease in
child labor. In the comarcas, the increase in
school enrollment was a bit lower at 7.9 percentage points, but the decrease in child labor
greater (15.8 percentage points). The health
benefits were not as large across the board
but improved in some areas: incidence of Papanicolau test rose almost 12 and 15 points
among rural and indigenous women respectively. A qualitative analysis of the program
highlighted the overall positive perceptions
of the program and identified some areas for
improvement. Beneficiaries noted not just
the economic benefit and access to services
but also an increased sense of social inclusion and female empowerment. Children’s
access to schooling has improved. In terms
of health, awareness regarding preventive reproductive health increased. The report found
that the program has had the unexpected pos­
itive results of strengthening social capital
and spawning initiatives for group savings
and microenterprises. Highlighting this,
beneficiaries suggested the introduction into
the program of stages, with productive entrepreneurship as a final stage.
The benefits of Red de Oportunidades
have been limited by a lack of differential
services for the various ethnic groups in
the country. The qualitative

Inclusiveness of Panama’s Growth

study emphasizes the need for adaptation
of service provision to the environment.
There continue to be issues in access and
educational quality, as well as the need for
multicultural bilingual education in indigenous areas. Program beneficiaries also expressed the need for culturally appropriate
health services and health workers with
specific skills to work in different cultural
contexts. The program has had less success
in affecting malnutrition as well. There
have also been concerns raised about implementation, with cultural sensitivities not
being addressed and inappropriate conditions being applied.
The non-contributory pension program
has the potential to lower poverty among the
elderly although it has not yet completely delivered on its promise. While no formal evaluation of the program exists, simulations of
first order effects using preprogram data (2009)
show that a universal assignment of 100 balboas to all people 70 and older could reduce
poverty among the older population by almost
half and nearly eradicate extreme poverty.
The differences in overall poverty reduction
for men and women are fairly similar, although
for extreme poverty the benefit would lower
poverty among men less, suggesting that elderly men suffer from more severe poverty
than do women. By 2013, however, only 30
percent of all elderly were enrolled in the pro­
gram, thus reducing its impact on poverty.
Nonetheless, it is clear that the program is
benefiting the poor elderly (figure 4.22). The
expansion of the program to 65 and older and
the increase in the benefit will also have an
important poverty reduction effect among
the older population. If the program is to have
this effect, however, issues affecting program

Inclusiveness of Panama’s Growth

take-up will need to be understood and
addressed.
The effects of the universal scholarship,
Beca Universal, also have not been evaluated.
The expansion of the program from secondary to all students has made it more progressive. It is likely that the program has helped
lower poverty in addition to increasing enrollment and retention rates. Simulations of
its effects on poverty using data from before
the program show a strong effect in indigenous areas. More recent anecdotal evidence
from the Ministry of Education suggests
that for the Ngäbe Buglé, the benefit has reduced the seasonal migration around the
coffee harvest, allowing children to remain
in school.
Despite the significant impact of public
transfers on extreme poverty, there are still
challenges related to both targeting and the
take-up of programs. As noted previously, less
than half of those eligible for the non-contributory pension actually received it in 2012,
and lack of cultural adaptation may be affecting the take-up of Red de Oportunidades. Additionally, 18 percent of the population in the
bottom quintile receives no social assistance
of any sort. Nor does all spending benefit the
poor (figure 4.23). There are costly leakages,
with 31 percent of spending of the top seven
social programs going to the top 60 percent
of the population. This leakage of benefits to
the richer end of the distribution is also mirrored in some of the government’s subsidy
programs. Cooking gas subsidies, for example, represented US$82 million in 2010 dollars and increased government spending by
2.1 percent, yet the subsidy barely reaches the
poorest: three in four extremely poor cook
with wood.

1. As intermediate moves cannot be seen in the
data, it is unknown if rural migrants move
directly to large urban areas or make a series
of intermediate moves, moving first to small
towns or cities and then to larger ones.
2. Using the census data allows for an analysis
of all five comarcas, not just the three largest
represented in the household survey (EML).
However, approximately three percent of the
indigenous population in Panama lives in
territories that have not been given the legal
status of comarca. These are considered to live
in non-comarca areas for the purpose of the
present analysis.
3. We are indebted to members of the civil society
consultation group around Afro-descendant
issues for this insight.
4. See Chapter 5 below for a discussion of other
issues related to Afro-descendants that these
data cannot address.

5. Prioritization Linked to Inclusion
Benchmarking
The strong economic growth in recent
years has been inclusive, yet it had different
effects across regions and populations—with
some benefiting significantly less. On the
positive side, incomes of all groups rose, with
those at the lower end and the middle of the
income distribution increasing the most.
Economic growth also translated into the expansion of services and access to education
and health. Poverty fell, and social outcomes
improved. Overall, Panama’s poverty rate
places it ahead of most of its peers (figure
5.1). However, the analysis in the previous
chapter has shown that even in an environment of strong growth pre-existing income
and opportunity gaps in the country have
persisted. Moreover, it is unclear that the
present growth model will be adequate to
eradicate extreme poverty in the near future.

Within Panama

Comparing different population groups reveals a continuum of states of poverty even
within the groups of poor and extremely
poor Panamanians. Using household survey
data, comparisons of income poverty, human
capital, and household characteristics were
made for the populations living in urban and
rural areas and the comarcas. The results of
the comparison are clear (see figures 4.12
and 4.13 in the previous chapter). Among
the poor and extremely poor in Panama, the
groups with the least human capital, lowest
incomes, and greatest dependence on social
assistance are the indigenous population living in the comarcas. Using the census data,
Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

comparisons were made by ethnic groups:
indigenous people living in comarcas, indigenous people living outside of the comarcas,
Afro-descendants, and all others in the country. The census does not provide a comparable measure of income poverty but does have
information on human capital, income, and
demographic and household characteristics
linked to welfare. Again the results of the
comparison (see table 4.2 in the previous chap­
ter) show a clear welfare hierarchy: among
the poor and the extremely poor, it is the indigenous living in the comarcas that have the
lowest levels of income and human capital
and show the highest dependency ratios.
High economic growth benefited some
groups less, particularly the indigenous population. Overall poverty reduction in the past
five years has been on the order of 34 percent
(28 percent for extreme poverty). The comarcas have also experienced a lower level of poverty reduction than the rest of the country.
Urban areas saw extreme poverty fall 40 per­
cent between 2007 and 2012. Extreme poverty
in rural areas fell only by 15 percent, less but
still a respectable reduction. In contrast, the
comarcas experienced only a four percent decline in extreme poverty in the same period.
This means that the share of the extremely
poor by area is even more disproportionate to
the area’s population share than before. Urban
areas represent 75 percent of the national
population, but only 20 percent of the extremely poor live in urban areas. The comarcas, however, where only six percent of the
population lives, concentrate 42 percent of the
extreme poor (figure 5.2). This concentration
has increased markedly in the 2007–2012

changes between the indigenous population
and the overall population is smaller than in
Panama.
The differences between Panama’s
Indigenous Peoples’ access to services and
those in other Latin American and Caribbean
(LAC) countries are striking. Among 12 Latin
American countries, Panama has both the
lowest level of electricity coverage among the
indigenous population (40 percent) and the
largest gap between the indigenous and nonindigenous populations (52 percentage points
compared to the next largest gap of 38 percentage points in Colombia).1 The gap in
­sanitation is also the largest; and only one
country, Nicaragua, has lower absolute levels.
For piped water, again, the gap is largest in
Panama although the absolute level is higher
than in Colombia, Nicaragua, and Peru.
Access to Internet is also systematically lower
among the indigenous populations in the

Across Latin America

In addition to exhibiting the most severe
poverty in Panama, the indigenous peoples
living in comarcas in Panama fare poorly
compared to other indigenous people in
Latin America in both absolute and relative
terms (figure 5.3). The substantial gaps between indigenous and nonindigenous populations within Panama in terms of services
and human capital are mirrored in the gaps
between the Indigenous Peoples of Panama
and other Indigenous Peoples in the region.
Additionally, other countries in the region
with large indigenous populations have seen
economic growth more effectively moving
these groups out of poverty. In Bolivia,
Ecuador, and Peru, the gap in poverty rate

region and the indigenous–nonindigenous
gap in Panama is one of the largest.2 On a
slightly more positive note, while Panama’s
rate of change in terms of access to sanitation
is one of the slowest, the rate of change for access to water and electricity is faster than in
many countries.
Health indicators are also lower among
the indigenous population in Panama than
in the rest of Latin America. Infant mortality rates among indigenous children are
higher only in Bolivia. Panama has the largest gap between infant mortality rates of indigenous and nonindigenous children
(three times greater among the indigenous
population) and has one of the lower rates
of change.3 It is also one of only two Latin
American countries where the elderly are
more male than female, perhaps a reflection
of the extremely high rates of adolescent
pregnancy (Panama’s Indigenous Peoples
have the highest rates of teen pregnancy
among the indigenous in Latin America
and the largest gap between indigenous and
nonindigenous), and low rates of births attended by skilled medical practitioners.4
The indigenous populations in Panama and
Brazil are also disproportionately affected
by HIV/AIDS.5
Only on education indicators do the
Indigenous Peoples of Panama appear to do
better than other indigenous groups in Latin
America.6 Levels are higher, and there have
been many positive changes. Primary enrollment among indigenous children is almost
universal; and secondary enrollment, while
lower, is similar to that of other indigenous
groups in the region. The country still lags
behind, however, in tertiary enrollment.
Nonetheless, in both rural and urban areas,
the indigenous groups fare less well than
their nonindigenous counterparts.7
86

Priority Area
The increasing concentration of poverty in indigenous areas suggests that special
attention is needed for these areas and this
population group. The Indigenous Peoples of
Panama have significant social capital, with
well-developed and functioning community
and governance structures. Their lands represent significant wealth and biodiversity.
However, many of the Indigenous Peoples in
Panama suffer from chronic poverty and
have multiple deprivations: extremely low
incomes, low access to basic services and infrastructure, lower human capital, poorer
health outcomes, fewer labor options, and de
facto land tenure insecurity. Many of these
problems are long term and have been less
responsive to economic growth and social
program impacts than expected.
The complexities of addressing the twin
goals in the comarcas require attention to issues of culturally appropriate economic opportunity, social assistance, infrastructure
provision, and the enforcement of legal
rights. The concentration of economic
growth in specific sectors and geographic
areas outside of the comarcas, along with the
limited shifts in employment and earnings
within the comarcas, highlight the constraints of the present growth model and domestic markets. The challenges faced by the
social protection system in the comarcas also
merit further attention. Spending levels are
at adequate levels, but outcomes are muted.
Education enrollments have increased, in
part due to social assistance programs, but
less in the comarcas than in other rural areas.
The benefits in health, too, are more limited.
The impact on poverty reduction, in the
short term, is constrained because of limits
both in coverage and in benefits. The lack of
Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

services continues to be a constraint, particularly water and sanitation. Low population
density and dispersed populations are often
blamed for lack of service provision. While
this may be true in part, the fact that Los
Santos, one of the three provinces with the
highest rate of poverty reduction in the past
six years, also has a population density below
that of the poorest comarca suggests that
other barriers to service provision are at play
and need to be addressed. Additionally, the
lack of culturally appropriate models for development has reduced the positive impact
of government programs and policies.
Differences in community organization,
communal property, among others, need to
be taken into account. Furthermore, understanding the tradeoffs the indigenous
peoples are, and are not, willing to make
among different goals is needed.
Although solving the problems of extreme poverty in Panama will not be accomplished by focusing only on the Indigenous
Peoples living within the comarcas, this appears to be a good starting point. The fact
that the comarcas are home to 42 percent of
the extremely poor in the country explains
the focus on those areas, as does the fact that
poverty is worse in the comarcas than in the
rest of the country. As important, many of
the issues that affect livelihoods in the comarcas also affect those of their rural neighbors. Some investments, such as those in
basic infrastructure in roads, electrification,
and sewage systems would benefit both
groups—rural non-indigenous and rural indigenous populations. In contrast, investing
in social services such as health and education would require special attention to the
comarcas to adapt services to the social and
cultural norms of the Indigenous Peoples. In
short, while Panama’s agenda on eradicating
Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

extreme poverty is much broader than just
the comarcas, the levels and severity of poverty there and the slowness of positive
change suggest the importance of prioritizing the comarcas.

Identified Opportunities
The national integrated development
plan of the Indigenous Peoples of Panama
(DIPORP) provides a new opportunity to
affect welfare among Indigenous Peoples in
Panama. This is because it represents a consensus, is focused on the broad range of issues that affect development, and looks to
the long term as well as the short and medium terms.8 The Plan is the result of the
two-year effort by the National Indigenous
Development Working Group (Mesa nacional de desarrollo indígena). The Working
Group itself was established in the aftermath
of a period of conflict between the indigenous communities and the national government around land rights, among other
issues, and was charged with creating a national development plan that would become
national policy and be approved into law.9
(See box 5.1 for a summary of the specific
areas of the DIPORP)
The Plan DIPORP represents a consensus among the 12 indigenous congresses.
For the first time, there is one document
that has been agreed upon by all the
Indigenous Peoples in the country and represents a unified vision of the goals and priorities of these groups. The lengthy process
undertaken by the Working Group to reach
this consensus was carefully designed to respect the traditions and customs of each
group. During the first phase of the Plan
DIPORP’s development (March–July 2013),
the traditional authorities of each group

Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

carried out a total of 94 consultation meetings among the 12 indigenous congresses.
The second phase, that of drafting the Plan
itself, was carried out by a committee of indigenous and government representatives
and facilitated by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) representatives. The proposed Plan was submitted to the Working Group for approval on
October 1, 2013, and then underwent a validation process (phase three) across the
country and among all the indigenous
groups. The Plan was approved in
December 2013. The fourth phase, that of
approval by the government and the national assembly, was launched prior to the
elections; however, because of the change in
government, this fourth phase has had to be
restarted. A new law that would make the
Working Group permanent (and validate
the DIPORP) is expected to be submitted in
2016 to the national assembly for discussion
and debate.
The broadness of the DIPORP is another
factor that enhances its usefulness as a guide
for improving shared prosperity and eradicating extreme poverty among indigenous
populations. Unlike many related exercises,
the Plan is not limited simply to legal issues
but instead addresses the entire gamut of
constraints and opportunities facing the
Indigenous Peoples. The Plan is based on the
three thematic pillars of economic development, social development, and legal rights;
and its concrete goals and objectives across
these areas provide important direction for
how the national government, civil society,
and the Indigenous Peoples’ congresses can
work together to address poverty eradication
and promote shared prosperity.
Finally, the Plan DIPORP has a longterm focus. The Plan covers a 15-year
Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

planning horizon. This longer-term focus
provides an explicit opportunity for evaluation and adjustments to the Plan throughout
implementation and allows for investment
in both physical and human capital. Much
of the Plan DIPORP focuses on training and
capacity building, aimed at both the indigenous communities and public servants in an
attempt to build new mechanisms of service
provision and take-up. The Plan DIPORP
also addresses short-term concerns, but it is
the longer-term focus that provides the
greatest opportunity for Panama to affect
the welfare of the indigenous populations
and to learn in the process.
Using the Plan DIPORP as a foundation
will ensure that the cultural identity and the
specific characteristics of the Indigenous
Peoples are taken into account in the determination of the best combination of social
assistance and economic development. Local
knowledge, practices, systems, and experience are critical components in determining
the best combination of social assistance and
economic development that can lead to
long-term success. The Plan DIPORP highlights how many of the barriers to service
­access and use result from poor design
­ele­­ments that fail to embrace culturally specific practices and systems, and to include
the Indigenous Peoples in the design and delivery of programs—elements critical for
ownership and uptake. Addressing the cultural and contextual issues may help to make
public investment more effective: in the
2009–2012 period, overall budget execution
was just under 70 percent although the majority of the sectors saw much smaller percentages (housing 26 percent, agriculture 30
percent, for example).10 It is not clear
whether the low execution of public investment is due to inappropriate investments,
89

low take-up, or low capacity of executing
agencies.
The prioritization process for identifying
opportunities to affect inclusiveness and the
welfare of the indigenous populations is
based on the DIPORP and consultations
with the country team and stakeholders in
Panama. The critical opportunities that have
been identified reflect the three thematic pillars of the Plan: economic development, social development, and legal issues.
Opportunities have been identified
around specific types of economic development, governance, and the provision of
health and education services with the emphasis being on culturally appropriate interventions. In terms of economic activities,
the focus would be on economic development with identity, namely promoting activities that generate income while enhan­cing
existing natural resources. Increasing the
quality and access of health and education
services in indigenous communities requires that the service content and delivery
mechanisms are culturally pertinent. Finally,
the focus on governance is to take advantage of the opportunity to enhance the
Indigenous Peoples’ participation as
Panamanian citizens while at the same time
recognizing their cultural uniqueness and
diversity in aspirations and worldview.
Realizing these economic growth opportunities will depend heavily on progress
being made on the priority areas identified
in Chapter 3 above. Focusing on overcoming the present inability of the energy sector
to supply power to the comarcas will contribute to the development of new industries
and job creation within the comarcas. In
parallel, the opportunities identified around
institutions (regulations, transparency, and
effectiveness) will be needed to ensure that
90

revenues from economic opportunities can
be generated and effectively managed for the
benefit of the indigenous population while
the land rights of the Indigenous Peoples
are protected. This is of particular importance if the mining sector is to grow in a
­socially and environmentally appropriate
manner. Finally, as described in the Plan
DIPORP, education is a major concern. To
the extent that the system can be improved
through modernizing the curriculum and
adapting the way in which service is provided, both dropout and attainment levels
can be affected with subsequent effects on
economic outcomes.
Addressing these issues has a direct effect
on eradicating extreme poverty given that
such poverty is concentrated in the
Indigenous Peoples. Evidence for successful
interventions in culturally appropriate economic development comes from Australia,
Canada, Norway, Peru, and the United States
(Alaska). Costa Rica has implemented a
­program of Payments for Environmental
Services of US$3 million per year to indigenous communities for ten years. Both this
and the new anteproyecto de ley to regulate
Payments for Environmental Services, presented to the national assembly in August of
2014, could serve as a model for Panama.
Evidence of successful improvements in relationships between governments and the
Indigenous Peoples’ governance structures
can be found in Bolivia, Brazil, and Canada,
again examples of how such work could be
implemented in Panama.
There is substantial political will around
these opportunities. As discussed above, the
Plan DIPORP creates a platform on which
the indigenous communities themselves, the
national government, and the private sector
can build. Many of the proposed changes in
Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

service delivery are already covered in law
(Resuelto N° 4376 del 25 de agosto de 1999;
Ministerio de Salud, Medicina Tradicional,
Gaceta Oficial N° 23,880, 7 de septiembre de
1999; Bilingual and Intercultural Education
Law No. 88). And there are agreements in
place to legislate around the Plan DIPORP.
Finally, the creation of a vice-ministry of
Indigenous Affairs and the plan to transform
this into a ministry both point to the political feasibility of actions around these identified opportunities.

Filling Knowledge Gaps
The knowledge gap around Afrodescendants limits what can be concluded
in this report. For those indicators of well-being that exist, Afro-descendants are, on average, better off than the Indigenous Peoples.
However, they also suffer from multiple
deprivations. A 2013 qualitative study highlights the fact that both Afro-Panamanians

and other Panamanians perceive racial discrimination as a factor that creates obstacles
to Afro-descendants’ economic, educational,
social, and labor opportunities and limits access to basic services as compared to the rest
of the Panamanian population. Furthermore,
Afro-Panamanians perceive negative stereotyping in the media toward the Afro-descen­
dant community. Afro-Panamanian women
feel they are particularly discriminated
against, especially in the labor force. Others
argue that Afro-descendant populations live
in areas with poorer infrastructure, have
lower access to education, health care, employment, and political participation. An important task going forward will be to address
both the data gaps in the country as well as to
pull together what little data exist to attempt
to better understand the constraints and opportunities of this group. It is hoped that the
Consejo de la Etnia Negra (Council of the
Black Ethnicity) will be a source for further
consultation and data.11

Prioritization Linked to Inclusion

6. Sustainability
How sustainable is Panama’s progress ​
toward achieving the twin goals of reducing
poverty and increasing shared prosperity?
The previous sections of this document have
described Panama’s progress toward the twin
goals, the country’s outstanding growth performance, and the overall inclusive nature of
this growth so far. The current section turns
to the future, addressing the question of
whether Panama can sustain this progress.
This question will be addressed from an economic, social, and environmental perspective,
followed by a reflection on priority areas from
a sustainability point of view.

Economic Sustainability
In the past, Panama has achieved progress mainly through fast economic growth, a
strategy that is viable for the short to medium
term, albeit with a few qualifications. Given
the rapid growth of recent years, it is expected
to moderate in the future. As pointed out in
the growth section, however, the identified
priority areas of energy, education, and public
sector institutions are likely to impact growth
negatively in the future if they remain unaddressed. Moreover, as pointed out in the inclusiveness section, growth may continue to
stop short of including the Indigenous Peoples
of Panama, unless specific efforts are made to
address their situation and opportunities. In
addition, compliance with international transparency standards, continued efforts on macroeconomic stabilization policies, and the
economic role of the Canal for the country
need to be carefully taken into account. This
section discusses these three challenges.
Sustainability

The sustainability of Panama’s high reliance on foreign financing for its investment
program will depend on continued progress
on compliance with international transparency standards. In 2000 the country appeared
on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task
Force on Money Laundering (FATF) as a
“high-risk and noncooperative jurisdiction”
that did not support international efforts to
fight money laundering.1 In addition,
­Panama’s practices on tax information sharing caught the attention of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Forum, resulting in
the initiation in 2009 of a peer-review process on the full and effective exchange of information. Finally, Panama’s maritime
registry also appeared on the blacklist of the
Paris Memorandum of Understanding. This
international body, made up of 27 maritime
administrations from Europe and North
America, seeks to eliminate the operation of
substandard ships through a harmonized
system of state control of ports. Panama’s
open registry allows for easy registration
(often online), employment of cheaper foreign labor, and exemption for foreign owners
from income taxes. Panama’s registry is consistently beset by allegations of corruption
and criticized for hiding the true identity of
ship owners and for lax enforcement of rules
and regulations.
Panamanian authorities reacted to the
country’s inclusion on the money laundering
blacklist in 2000 by adopting legislation that
moved the country up to the so-called gray
list in June 2001. In particular, Panama introduced new legislation to expand criminal
93

offenses for money. The so-called gray list of
the Financial Action Task Force names countries that are in the process of improving
compliance with international standards on
global anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. In the Latin
American region, Argentina, Cuba, and Nicaragua also appear in this list. A recent report on observance of standards and codes
conducted by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) found that Panama’s anti-money-laundering framework was still not fully
in line with the Task Force’s recommendations. Panama has ratified the main United
Nations Conventions on money laundering
and has legal provisions in its Penal Code
that are broadly in line with the standards set
by the Task Force. According to the report,
however, a number of significant deficiencies
remain.2
In June 2014, the government made a
high-level political commitment to addressing these remaining deficiencies. The government will work on implementing its
action plan to address these deficiencies, including by (i) adequately criminalizing
money laundering and terrorist financing,
(ii) establishing and implementing an adequate legal framework for freezing terrorist
assets, (iii) establishing effective measures
for customer due diligence to enhance transparency, (iv) establishing a fully operational
and effectively functioning financial intelligence unit, (v) establishing suspicious transaction reporting requirements for all finan­cial
institutions and designated nonfinancial
businesses or professions, and (vi) ensuring
effective mechanisms for international cooperation.3 Progress in implementing this action plan and the passage of a new
anti-money-laundering law would address
the major deficiencies identified in the
94

report on observance of standards and codes
and would help to strengthen Panama’s status as an international financial and business
center.
In terms of compliance with international
standards of tax transparency, Panama has
taken measures to move to the next phase of
the OECD Global Forum’s peer review process. Compliance with the Global Forum’s
standards involves demonstrating that national legislation and bilateral or multilateral
agreements on information sharing for tax
purposes meets the standards of ten different
technical elements. In September 2009, the
Global Forum launched a formal two-phase
peer review process to monitor and review
Panama’s progress toward full and effective
exchange of information: (i) Phase 1 (review
of the legal and regulatory frameworks of
each country) and (ii) Phase 2 (assessment of
the practical implementation of the “internationally agreed standard” on tax transparency). Panama has made significant progress
in these areas. The Panamanian government
has successfully negotiated 19 Double International Taxation Agreements based on the
OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income
and on Capital, and 11 of these are already in
force. As a result of these agreements, the
government has adjusted its internal legislation for effectively applying international tax
agreements and for promoting transparency
and effective information exchange for tax
purposes. In order to achieve this, the government passed (i) Law 33-2010 to introduce
transfer pricing rules, permanent establishment, and tax residency into Panama’s Fiscal
Code; (ii) Resolution 088-DS/AL 2010 to
create the International Taxation Unit and
the Tax Information Exchange Unit; (iii) Law
2-2011 to identify and apply the “Know your
clients” procedures; and (iv) Law 47-2013 to
Sustainability

immobilize bearer shares through a custodial
arrangement system.
In addition, Panama was able to reform
its maritime registry to advance to the white
list of compliant countries. Since 2008,
­Panama has made enough progress in reforming its maritime registry to advance to
the white list of the Paris Memorandum of
Understanding.
Macro stability remains a continuous
task and requires a high degree of fiscal
prudence in order to be sustainable. Given
that Panama has given up monetary policy
as a policy tool and restrained the use of fiscal policy, the country has little room for
discretionary fiscal policies. Mindful of this,
Panama is managing its fiscal balance following a fiscal rule, the social and fiscal responsibility law introduced in 2002 and
updated several times to adapt to realities
such as the 2008 global financial crisis. The
fiscal rule mandates fiscal deficit ceilings
and has helped Panama to maintain fiscal
prudence.
Additional budget flexibility would be
welcome, however, in order to create room
for countercyclical policy. Almost 70 percent
of the total expenditure in Panama is rigid.
This rigidity is even more binding in the
context of low tax revenue collection, which
averaged 10.2 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) from 2001 to 2013, compared to the already low 12.7 percent of GDP
of the Central American region. The requirement of prudent fiscal policy restrains the
government in terms of public service provision to Panamanian citizens. Moreover, 50
percent of nontax revenues come from the
Panama Canal, making the government
highly dependent on these resources. Policy
measures such as the creation of a sovereign
fund (Fondo de Ahorro de Panama) are
Sustainability

adequate but might be insufficient to provide
fiscal resources for prolonged periods of
downturn where revenues from both the
Canal and tax collection are dropping in the
context of a shrinking economy.
In addition to prudent fiscal policy, the
country’s dollarization also calls for a healthy
banking sector. Lending practices in Panama
need to be (and indeed have been) more
conservative than in countries with a lender
of last resort or a deposit insurance scheme
with greater liquidity reserves and a strict,
efficient supervisory role. The Panamanian
Superintendence of Banks has played a
strong role in this sense.
As an international financial center with
extensive external links, the country is exposed to external risks and heavy reputational risks. Foreign assets of Panamanian
banks represent 39 percent of GDP, significantly more than in the five largest economies of Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), none of which exceed five percent. As
a result, credit risks in foreign country debtors could have significant impact on the balance sheet of Panamanian banks. Similarly,
foreign liabilities of the Panamanian banking
system represent 95 percent of GDP, more
than four times larger than Chile with the
highest percentage (21 percent) relative to
GDP among the top five Latin American
economies. This implies that the Panamanian banking sector is highly exposed to international interest rates.
Finally, the crucial role of the Panama
Canal for the country’s economy warrants a
close look at the sustainability of Canal operations. In particular, competition to the Canal
requires constant adjustment to maintain
market edge. Alternative shipping routes to
the Panama Canal have been a constant
source of curiosity, and there continue to be
95

many attempts to find other options for
global routes. To the east, Egypt’s recent
project to widen parts of the Suez Canal
seeks to enlarge transit capacity and decrease
waiting time from 18 to 11 hours for most
ships. The 72-kilometer works should be
completed within one year, according to official government statements.
Closer to home, several countries have
played with the idea of a dry canal in Central
America; however, this remains a commercially less competitive option. The recent announcement by Panama’s northern neighbor
Nicaragua of the initiation of a project to
build the Nicaragua Canal passing through
Lake Managua could, once completed, have
a significant impact on the share of trade
going to Panama. The project, financed by
the Hong Kong SAR, China–based HKND
Group, is estimated to cost US$50 billion
and will include some of the largest earthworks in recent times to clear a 278-kilometer passageway through Lake Managua,
raising significant environmental and social
concerns.
In the medium to long term, another
less-cited competition may be created by
nature as global warming melts the Arctic
cap. Its summer ice cover has already
shrunk by more than 40 percent over the
last few decades, raising the prospect that it
may soon be possible to sail along the Arctic sea routes with ease. By using the Northern Passage along Russia’s northern coast or
the Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic archipelago, large bulk carriers
would substantially reduce the distance between Asia, Europe, and North America.
This would mean saving more than 4,000
nautical miles between German and Japanese ports.4

96

Social Sustainability
The country’s main risks relative to social sustainability and social cohesion are
linked to (i) the dynamic growth that has
lifted many into middle-class status while
leaving others in extreme poverty, (ii) the
crime and violence linked to Panama’s strategic position as a drug corridor, and (iii) weak
land rights protection. The stark economic
inequalities and relative deprivations, along
with both perceptions and evidence of corruption and more precarious forms of urban
employment, create strains on society. Relative deprivation has led some groups to further organize and assert their political voice
(such as the Mesa Indigena), while others
take advantage of the low barriers to entry to
the illegal drug trade that continues to grow
in the country’s unofficial economy.
Relative poverty in urban areas, exclusion, and the illegal drug trade are factors in
the increases in violent crime and gender-based violence. The country’s homicide
rate places it 39th globally in terms of homicides (figure 6.1).5 Cases of reported rape
rose 36 percent between 2009 and 2012—
and in 2009, 19.7 percent of women nationally experienced some kind of physical
violence after the age of 12, with 9.3 percent
reporting experiencing physical violence
within the past year.6 In addition, thefts have
risen nine percent.7 The population is very
conscious of the increased crime and violence. In 2004, crime and violence ranked
third in the perceived top five problems of
the country, moving up to first place by 2008
and remaining there (figure 6.2).8
Urban youth, along with rural and indigenous populations, face particular risks. Similar to many of its Central American
neighbors, Panama has a large youth cohort,

with 24.9 percent of the population between
the ages of 15 and 29, 15 percent of whom
neither work nor attend school. Rising gang
activity, with roughly 240 gangs in Panama
that operate in and around the major urban
centers, is of some concern. Rural and indigenous areas are also vulnerable to crime and
violence. This is particularly the case in
Sustainability

Darién, a region socially and politically isolated and economically marginalized. Darién
has been affected by violent conflict between
Colombian and Mexican cartels for control
over narcotics trafficking routes and the
presence of demobilizing guerillas and displaced persons from Colombia. The violence
and insecurity affects production as families
97

move to larger population centers and
women stop working in community agricultural plots.
Crime and violence have the potential to
stifle growth if not managed. The examples
from the neighboring countries are stark.
An extensive growth analysis of El Salvador
identified crime and violence as one of the
two major constraints to growth with the
huge cost of crime and violence a major factor limiting El Salvador’s ability to compete
on the world markets.9 In Honduras, the
costs of crime are estimated to represent 10
percent of GDP—health costs alone are estimated at 1.3 percent of GDP—and the country could increase its GDP by 0.7 percent
with a 10-percent reduction in crime.10 Although estimates of costs are subject to error,
the fact that crime and violence, if unchecked, can hamper growth is a legitimate
concern.
Struggles around infringements of indigenous land rights also pose serious threats to
social sustainability. The legal establishment
of the five comarcas between 1938 and 2000
formed the base of rights and protections for
the indigenous population, a base that is
widely recognized as a model of indigenous
rights protection. However, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHR) argues that the legal framework is fragile and
that Panama has significant problems in
terms of both the implementation and the
protection of the rights of the Indigenous
Peoples, especially their rights over land and
natural resources.11 Panama is one of six
Latin American countries that have not
signed the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169, a legally
binding international instrument that deals
specifically with the rights of indigenous and
tribal peoples.
98

Illegal logging, large mining interests, and
other encroachment on indigenous lands are
ongoing problems. Land and resource issues
have sparked protests and confrontations,
leading to fatalities in recent years, and unrest may continue if Indigenous Peoples feel
threatened. The head of the National Coordinating Body of Indigenous Peoples in Panama said in reference to this issue: “We are a
peaceful people, but we are at war, and it is
being fought by women, children, men, caciques,” (Barrigón Dogirama as quoted in
Berger 2013).12 In 2011, after three weeks of
violent protests and roadblocks by the Ngäbe
Buglé and environmental groups, the government repealed Law 8, the reforms to the
mining law. The cancellation of this law
leaves a legal vacuum because the clauses of
the mining law that Law 8 had replaced were
not reinstated. Both the mining and tourism
sectors, although potential sources of much-​
needed growth, also have continued potential to impinge on indigenous rights and lead
to confrontations.
While the risks to social cohesion exist,
various factors may play a mitigating role.
The government’s recent success in reining in
homicide rates suggests that Panama may be
able to avoid the escalation seen in neighboring countries. Most youth gangs in ­Panama
are in relatively early stages of deve­lop­ment,
are largely a neighborhood-oriented pheno­
menon with limited adult invol­vement, and
lack criminal sophistication or links to organized crime or corrupt public officials. The
nascent gang problem, among others, could
be dealt with if the country can pull together
the well-established but fragmented array of
actors—governmental and non-governmental, including the private sector—that work
in the area of youth services and crime prevention to provide “wrap-around” services to
Sustainability

disenfranchised youth.13 Ratification of ILO
Convention 169 could help to promote land
and other rights because ratification would
trigger international supervision of the Convention’s implementation, covering a range
of issues from nondiscrimination to cultural
specificities, consultation and participation,
and the right to define priorities for development in the comarcas. The planned creation
of a Ministry of Indigenous Affairs to help
promote economic and social welfare of the
Indigenous Peoples in the country and support the Plan DIPORP provides further opportunities to improve the protection of land
and resources rights of the Indigenous
Peoples in Panama.

Environmental
Sustainability
Safeguarding Panama’s water and natural resource base is critical to the current
growth model linked to the Canal and other
economic activities. The Panama Canal
needs close to 2,580 cubic hectometers of
water per year and depends entirely on Lake
Gatun, and consequently, the health of the
surrounding rainforest. One month of full
operation uses about one-third of the available Gatun Lake volume, resulting in a heavy
dependence on precipitation, a concern in
the dry season.14 In 2015, once the Canal expansion is complete, an estimated 3,736
cubic hectometers of water will be needed to
operate the Canal, a 45 percent increase. Ensuring that water resources are adequately
managed is a top priority for the Autoridad
del Canal de Panama (Panama Canal Authority, or ACP), which has put in place a
strong management and monitoring system
to ensure that different demands for water
Sustainability

are met while maintaining the health of the
watershed ecosystem. The risk posed by
shifting climate patterns, therefore, becomes
critical to the sustainability of the Canal operation and hence economic sustainability.
The El Nino Southern Oscillation climatological phenomenon over the Panama Canal
watershed is characterized by a reduction of
total rainfall. In terms of long-term climate
change, the recent IPCC 5th Assessment
(IPCC 2014) cites a trend of increasing precipitation over most of Panama. This is generally good news for the Canal. However,
greater variability, with more frequent floods
and droughts, poses a real risk.
Infrastructure-based growth requires
strong environmental institutions and enforcement to avoid long-term irreversible
negative impacts. As Panama continues on
its development trajectory—fueled by investments in the construction and logistics sectors—and aspires to expand its image as a
tourism and service hub, strong regulatory
and institutional environmental framework,
monitoring, and enforcement are needed to
guide the design and implementation of infrastructure projects. The limitations of the
national environmental authority, ANAM, in
the areas of priority setting, planning, and
capacity to implement key regulations can
lead to significant negative impacts. Environmental information systems are also an important component in facilitating greater
public participation, an issue that has caused
several social conflicts and outbreak of violence around protected and indigenous areas
in past years.
In particular, the growth of the mining
sector faces environmental risks. As mentioned in previous sections, the mining sector has the potential to contribute
significantly as a driver of growth in the
99

coming decades. However, for this to materialize, the tension between its growth potential and the significant environmental and
social challenges needs to be addressed,
given that the mining sector is responsible
for some of the largest releases of heavy metals into the environment of any industry. It
also releases other air pollutants, including
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and
leaves behind tons of waste tailings, slag, and
acid drainage. Occupational and environmental exposure to heavy metals, silica, and
asbestos can occur during mining operations. The lack of an adequate regulatory
framework to regulate safe and sustainable
mining permits and of incentives for employment promotion and redistribution
schemes remains a key bottleneck keeping
the sector from reaching its potential.
Increasing urbanization has not been
matched by adequate planning and service-delivery capacity for safe and clean living conditions. A rapidly growing urban
population (at a rate of 2.4 percent per year,
it is the fifth highest in the region after Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, and Paraguay), as
was discussed in Chapter 4, increases the
pressure for adequate urban planning to
avoid future problems.15 Total environmental
health costs are estimated at 1.3 percent of
GDP per year.16 In particular, urban air pollution and associated respiratory illnesses
and mortality are a growing concern in Panama City, San Miguelito, and other urban
centers, with 90 percent of total air pollution
resulting from transport emissions from the
increasingly large vehicle fleet. The estimated
annual costs of mortality and morbidity due
to urban air pollution are estimated at 0.7
percent of GDP. There are marked quality
differences between fast-developing urban
areas and those lagging behind. For instance,
100

about 400,000 people in urban areas receive
water only seven hours per day, wastewater
collection is very low in low-income urban
areas, and 17 percent of the urban population still has inadequate latrines. The challenge of improving the urban environment is
reinforced by the ongoing process of decentralization. Law 37 of 2009 gives increased
responsibilities to municipal governments
for planning and investment in urban infrastructure. However, the increased responsibilities have not been coupled with adequate
capacity building to help municipalities undertake their enhanced roles in planning,
budgeting, and implementing sound investment choices. Institutional strengthening of
local governments will be critical to ensure
that Panama’s urbanization follows a sustainable trajectory.
In addition to rural vulnerability to natural disasters, the threat to urban areas from
disasters is also increasing. The indigenous
comarcas Ngäbe Buglé, Emberá-Wounaan,
and Guna Yala, and the provinces of Bocas
del Toro and Darién show historically significant levels of vulnerability to natural disasters. Those affected in these rural areas are
characterized by low incomes, as shown previously, as well as by precarious housing conditions and poor access to basic services
(water and sanitation, electricity, etc.). Increasingly, however, urban areas are also seeing more disaster impacts, within a context
of a general lack of informed disaster risk
management policies and interventions. The
Metropolitan Area of Panama, home to 43
percent of the country’s population and generating about 68 percent of the GDP, has
seen more floods of higher impact in the last
decade. More than ten national emergency
declarations have been issued since 2005,
with serious landslides and flooding affecting
Sustainability

Panama and Colón and estimated losses at
over US$135 million. While Panama’s exposure to seismic hazard is not as high as that
of neighboring countries, the potential losses

would be huge: a national loss of US$1,634
million is estimated if Panama were struck
today by an earthquake similar to that of July
18, 1934 (magnitude 7.4).

7. Prioritization Linked to Sustainability
Benchmarking
Successful Canal operations depend on
the availability of an adequate water supply
all year round. The risk of limited water
availability in critical months is evident: the
peak of Canal traffic coincides with the lowest rainfall period. Droughts such as the one
in 2014 threaten Canal operations by limiting the size of ships passing through. At the
same time, large storms threaten to flood the
Canal’s infrastructure, as famously occurred
in the unprecedented closure in December
2010 (see box 7.1). The urban expansion
west of the Canal towards Capira puts an
extra burden on the Gatun Lake while developments to the east impact the Madden Dam
buffer capacity. The data in the past decades
demonstrates that the incidence of extreme
weather events is increasing.
Climate change could lead to increased
variability in rainfall, thereby affecting Canal
operations. First, climate change may result
in changes in rainfall, which according to the
recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report
(IPCC 2014) cites a trend of increasing precipitation over most of Panama. Fabrega et
al. (2013) analyzed the projected hydroclimatic patterns for Panama, projecting an increase in precipitation over all four regions
of Panama for the 2015–2099 period: Bocas
del Toro, Veraguas, Panama Canal, and
Darién.1 Future precipitation appears to increase for all regions by at least five percent,
with the exception of some areas of the Bocas
del Toro region Fábrega et al. 2013. Increments greater than 15 percent were projected

Prioritization Linked to Sustainability

for the most populated areas in Panama located next to the Canal. However, another
predicted change is that of higher variability,
including increased occurrence of extreme
weather events. Overall, climate change–induced weather extremes could lead to costly
delays that would actually make the Canal a
less efficient shipping route.
In addition, adequate water management
underlies the country’s ability to generate hydropower for different uses. Hydropower
generation is the most water-intensive sector
in Panama, utilizing 50,000 cubic hectometers per year to operate.2 During several recent extended dry seasons causing low water
levels at hydroelectric dams, the metropolitan areas suffered from electricity rationing
and had to import the equivalent of a month
of energy usage for 100,000 families from the
Central American Electrical Interconnection
System.3 The growing economy—and related
rise in demand for hydropower—creates limitations on hydropower investments in specific areas. This increases the need to safe­guard
available opportunities, such as in the Bocas
del Toro region where rainfall patterns are not
predicted to increase much, and ensure that
the upstream watersheds remain healthy.
Sustaining Panama’s forest, biodiversity,
and coastal resources is also critical for
tourism and rural livelihoods. Tourism is a
growing industry in Panama, which in 2010
consumed 1.3 cubic hectometers of water.
Many of the large tourist resorts on the Pacific coast rely on groundwater resources.
In 2013, tourists spent approximately
US$4.5 billion in Panama, much of it linked

La Purisima

In December 2010, Panama experienced the longest rainstorm in the history of the Canal.
La Purisima—so named because it took place near the day of the Immaculate Conception,
December 8—posted a record 760 millimers of rainfall in 24 hours. The intense rain led to
500 landslides that impacted approximately 9,000 people and caused a surge in turbidity
of the water source to 700 NTU, causing the principal potable water plant for Panama City
to collapse. As a result, parts of Panama City were left without water for 50 days. Canal
operations were stalled for 17 hours; and for the fourth time in its history, the Autoridad
del Canal de Panama (ACP) had to open the lock drains to lower water levels. In addition,
the company charged with operating the Bayano Dam had to open its gates because the
basin nearly reached its maximum capacity. This action resulted in the flooding of the
town of El Llano in Chepo. Residents had to be evacuated and lost approximately US$6
million in agricultural production and household structures. The total cost of La Purisima
was estimated at US$150 million.

to the forest, biodiversity, and coastal resources that attract increasing numbers
every year. The amount of water needed to
sustain the health of Panama’s ecosystems is
yet unknown. The National Environmental
Autho­rity (ANAM) has established the necessary amount of water for ecological protection at 10 percent of overall water flow
in basins when granting water resource
concessions, but recognizes that this number does not represent the amount of water
necessary for conservation.4 Although agriculture consumes much less water and
plays a smaller role in the economy (three
percent of gross domestic product [GDP]),
the livelihood of the rural poor depends
upon it and subsistence farmers have far
fewer coping mechanisms in the face of extreme weather and climate events. The National Plan for the Integrated Management
of Water Re­sources (2010–2030) identifies

104

the main contamination source in Panama
as the direct discharge of sewage into water
bodies without prior or sufficient treatment. The second main contamination
source identified is the dumping of solid
waste into water bodies. This is followed by
diffuse contamination from agriculture
(pesticide and fertilizer runoff) and detergent use in cities. Finally, deforestation is
also listed as a source of contamination as
erosion causes ­sedimentation and high turbidity levels on water bodies.

Priority Area
Given its central role in the economic
engine of Panama, as well as being a key
component for other growth sectors and the
livelihoods of the poor, adequate water resources management emerges as the key priority area under sustainability.

Prioritization Linked to Sustainability

In Panama, there are two worlds of water
resources management: the Panama Canal
watershed and the rest of the territory. The
ACP has a strong monitoring and management program for its water sources, watersheds, and forestry resources to ensure the
continuity and sustainability of water supply
for Canal operations. This includes hydraulic
and water quality monitoring, as well as
strict land use planning, community-based
forest conservation, and sustainable resource
use programs in the Canal’s watershed. In
contrast, the remaining 95 percent of the
country’s watersheds fall under the authority
of ANAM, where the capacity and resources
to implement and enforce the National Plan
for the Integrated Management of Water Resources (2010–2030) are more limited.
Comparison of results from water management efforts shows stark differences. The
ACP is fully responsible for the conservation
and management of the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW), supported by an interinstitutional commission. On the other hand,
ANAM’s responsibility for watershed
­management overlaps with several other institutions, such as the Ministry of Health
(MINSA) and the National Water Supply
and Sanitation Administration (IDAAN).
Over the last two decades, systematic monitoring of the PCW has included vegetation
cover, hydrological conditions, water quality,
and social aspects related to land use and
settlement. Water quality in PCW ranks
good to excellent. In contrast, ANAM carries
out water balances at only ten watersheds
and 95 rivers. Of those monitored, 34
percent are classified as contaminated or
slightly contaminated. Only four watersheds
have management plans, and only one has
an implementation strategy. In terms of

Prioritization Linked to Sustainability

concrete results, the ACP was able to reforest
and maintain more than 6,200 hectares in
the PCW, compared to only 300 hectares
around the targeted watersheds in the rest of
the country. In its conservation efforts, the
ACP has involved and helped over 3,500
producers and residents to receive land titles,
and engaged over 6,000 residents and producers in training programs related to sustainable management and production
systems. Finally, forecasting and modeling
climate change impacts is a central component of the design of new investments in and
around the Canal. In contrast, only limited
information and small-scale adaptation and
mitigation programs have been undertaken
by ANAM in selected dry areas. Appendix E
provides a detailed comparison of the two
management models and associated
­program results.

Identified Opportunities
Implementing integrated water resources management plans in priority
basins can provide a gradual expansion of
the successful model outside the Canal watershed. Rather than focusing on revising the
legal framework for water resources management (which could prove to be a lengthy
process), the country could embark on a prioritized program to improve the management plans and implementation capacity in
selected priority watersheds. The development of river basin–based plans would benefit from the successful experience of the
PCW, including through sharing of knowledge and expertise across the two institutions, and would help build ANAM’s
institutional capacity to gradually expand its
coverage.

105

Scaling up integrated disaster-risk planning coupled with long-term climate change
adaptation measures is critical to enhance
Panama’s future resilience capacity. ANAM
is working on small-scale climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, which
should be scaled up to better prepare vulnerable groups and sectors for higher rainfall
and longer dry seasons. To achieve this,
there is a need to better integrate national disaster-risk management into water resource
management planning in priority basins. Enhanced information and decision support capacity across key sectors—along with
improved early warning and monitoring systems—is required to forecast and plan for a
future in which the occurrence of extreme
events could be the new norm. A detailed
description of these opportunities in the
water sector is also included in Appendix C.

Filling Knowledge Gaps
The hydrogeological situation of the
country is not well known. Investing in a
better understanding of the water resource
base is a priority in the short to medium
term. Panama’s National Plan for Integrated
Water Resources Management (2010-2030)

indicates that the number of water-use concessions have increased from 350 in 2004 to
952 in 2010, which is only a portion of the
actual number of users. About 34 percent of
the available water is classified as contaminated or slightly contaminated. Water use
conflicts occur frequently among users of
the same water source, with limited government capacity to manage and monitor water
use. At the same time, economic incentives
and instruments to adequately value and
manage water allocations are nonexistent in
Panama, monitoring capacity is limited, and
the legal and regulatory framework is outdated. ANAM could be supported in developing a better understanding of water
avai­lability, especially of groundwater.
ANAM estimated that 235,000 people,
many of whom live in rural areas, rely on
groundwater for domestic and agricultural
uses; but the country currently has limited
knowledge on the quantity and quality of
groundwater.5 ANAM collects water balances at only ten watersheds and does not
have a full picture of the current water demand, making it difficult to establish a fair
price for the ecological value of water. Filling this knowledge gap is considered a priority over the short to medium term.

8. Conclusion
The analysis identifies five policy
priorities that Panama may consider in
order to continue its recent track record
on growth, poverty reduction, and shared
prosperity. Near-term growth prospects for
Panama are good, with projections for
2014–2019 at about six percent based on
sustaining high levels of investment. A number of potential impediments are emerging,
however, and could slow growth over the
medium to long term if left unaddressed.
First, infrastructure, specifically energy, is
creating bottlenecks to growth. Second,
weaknesses in education—including high
dropout rates from secondary education—
and a shortage of skilled labor may be
limiting growth. Third, weak public sector
institutions may slow growth, particularly
if challenges of transparency, pockets of
low efficiency, and weaknesses in the regulatory framework remain unaddressed. In
terms of building an inclusive society, the
analysis shows that the indigenous have
benefited least from Panama’s excellent
growth performance. Therefore, addressing
the challenge of their inclusion has been
identified as a fourth priority area. Finally,
water management has emerged as the fifth
priority area. Because climate change could
lead to increased variability in rainfall,
careful water management is necessary
to sustain the successful operation of
the Panama Canal as a major pillar of
economic activity.1
These five priority areas are even more
relevant when we take into account the
valuable synergies among them. The analysis

Conclusion

in this document has been framed around
three questions. What is the nature of
growth? How inclusive is that growth?
And how sustainable is that growth? It is
clear that each priority area affects the
others. Some simple examples illustrate
this point.
Infrastructure with a focus on energy has
emerged as a priority area for economic
growth and is also highly relevant to inclusion and the sustainability of the development model. As described in the inclusion
chapter, the limited access of the indigenous
population to electricity and basic services
is a barrier to their economic growth.
Addressing the country’s energy deficit will
help remove this barrier and facilitate
productive activities and human capital
investments. At the same time, appropriately
addressing energy shortages can improve
fiscal and environmental sustainability.
The opportunities identified to improve
education and skills will also lead to
advancement on multiple fronts: a more
highly skilled workforce; stronger economic
sectors, including energy and water
­management; and greater social inclusion.
Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of education with the goal of improving
the quality could help identify institutional
weaknesses in the education sector. Knowing
in which parts of the country pupils are
doing well and crossing administrative data
with outcome data can deliver useful insights
in this context. With stronger and targeted
technical education, better-prepared graduates will be available for the labor market.

109

This will lead to a skilled workforce available
to work in the water management and
energy sectors. The Panama Canal Authority
(ACP) hires highly educated individuals and
is one of the most efficient organizations of
the country. A stronger workforce in the
energy sector could lead to a growth impulse
in the long run that could generate even
more energy demand and reinforce the need
for action in this sector. At the same time,
closing the education gap between the poor
and non-poor by providing opportunities to
rural and indigenous Panamanians is highly
relevant to inclusion. Given the particularly
high dropout rates in indigenous areas, the
increased payments of the conditional cash
transfer program Beca Universal could make
a difference. However, in this context, it is
important to understand the parameters for
the high dropout rates in those areas.
The opportunities identified under the
institution priority area provide other clear
examples of complementarity: institutional
capacity clearly affects growth, inclusion, and
sustainability. An improvement in public
sector management, be it through performance-based budgeting or enhanced fiscal
management, will free resources that could
be spent on other areas, including education
or Indigenous Peoples. In addition, greater
transparency will also lead to a more efficient
allocation of public resources. In terms of
improving the regulatory framework,
adopting a modern mining regulatory
framework to promote adequate oversight,
benefit sharing and environmental and social
sustainability is one of the likely necessary
conditions to begin conversations with
Indigenous Peoples on developing this
industry in comarcas. Enforcing consistent
social and environmental safeguards

110

regulations and standards across sectors
obviously will have an important and
positive impact on water management.
A final example of complementarities is
seen within the Indigenous Peoples priority
area. Although the focus on indigenous
groups arose from the assessment of inclusion, facilitating the contribution of these
groups to economic activity in line with their
cultural values would contribute to national
growth and sustainable development.
Increasing the pertinence of health and
education services in indigenous communities could help reduce high dropout rates in
there. Supporting economic development
while respecting cultural identity—especially
in relation to payments for environmental
services and robust benefit-sharing
­arrangements—certainly create complementarities with water management and the
institutional framework. Sectors like mining
and tourism may be able to generate higher
growth if Panama becomes a more inclusive
society. The strengthening and formalizing
of Indigenous Peoples’ participation in
government decisions and processes has
potential positive effects on all the other
priority areas.
In summary, Panama has been a success
story in most regards and, by addressing the
identified priority areas, is likely to sustain
this success. There are, of course, risks—
including, for example, the global economic
environment, rising interest rates, and
climate change. There is also the risk that
Panamanians could be unable to reach the
consensus to move on the priority areas. The
country has proven, however, to be resilient
during recent crises, and the analysis in this
report suggests that Panama has the building
blocks for locking in success.

high levels of FDI it depends on (in the absence of a developed
stock market); continued poverty reduction and shared prosperity
depends critically strong levels of FDI, especially in the short term.

Increases accountability and transparency and reduces transaction
costs; improving the public procurement practices will improve the
monitoring and evaluation of public investment and spending,
improving the efficiency of public spending, thereby freeing up
resources for strengthening social assistance programs that help
move people out of poverty in both the present and the future (in
the latter by breaking the cycle of poverty: Red de Oportunidades)

Institutional
Set Up for
WRM

Within ANAM, the Department for Water Resource Management sits in
the Management Unit on Integrated Watershed Management (see
appendix A).
The UNESCO-supported Inter-Institutional Water Resources Council
(CONAPHI) includes 13 institutions and Panama aims to coordinate and
lead water resource management.
ANAM’s 2010–2030 Plan for Integrated Water Resource Management
includes a diagnostic of water resources management and recommends
key activities in the short and medium terms based upon the identified
gaps and areas of weakness. ANAM has made limited progress on
implementing targeted aspects of the Plan.

Monitoring
Capacity

ANAM carries out water balances at ten watersheds and assesses
water quality in 95 rivers. ANAM currently does not have the financial or
technical capacity to monitor water balances or water quality across
the country and is reliant on government funding to extend its water
resource management activities.4
ETESA is responsible for operating and maintaining the national
network of meteorological and hydrological stations. In 2011, ETESA
had 95 active stations to measure rainfall, temperature and relative
humidity among other factors.5

The ACP heads the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Panama Canal
Watershed (CICH), which includes the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Justice and Governance, the Authority for the
Inter-Oceanic Region, as well as non-profit organizations. The CICH is
responsible for coordinating all initiatives in the PCW.3 The ACP, through
the CICH, is carrying out its Plan for Sustainable Development and
Integrated Water Resource Management. The ACP also has an Executive
Vice Presidency for Environment, Water, and Energy.

The ACP and its predecessor, the Canal Commission, have conducted
extensive monitoring activities associated with Canal operations over the
last two decades. Monitoring activities have been associated mainly with key
environmental and social conditions central to the management of Canal
operations and the quantity and quality of hydrologic resources. As such
many of the traditional monitoring activities have focused on the Canal area
watershed and have included monitoring of such environmental aspects as
vegetation cover, hydrological conditions, and water quality as well as social
aspects related to land use and settlements. Most of these long-term
environmental monitoring programs are key components of ACP
responsibilities established in the Organic Law for the adequate management
use, and conservation of the Canal Watershed water resources.

Quality of
Water

National Environmental Authority (ANAM)

Panama Canal Authority (ACP)

In the 95 rivers that ANAM monitors, 34 percent are classified as
contaminated or slightly contaminated.6 The main source of
contamination is domestic sewage.

In 2013, the quality of the water in the PCW received a ranking of 87 on
the Global Water Quality Index, positioning the quality of the water
between good and excellent.

Sustainability Measures

Plans

Watershed management plans for four watersheds

Reforestation

Reforested 300 hectares around targeted watersheds9

Reforested and maintaining more than 6,200 hectares in the PCW10

Community
Involvement

Capacity building exercises for 200 community groups and
cooperatives

The ACP through the CICH supports a range of community-based social
and environmental development projects to protect the PCW. For example,
in conjunction with the National Lands Administration Authority, the ACP
has helped over 3,500 producers and residents in the PCW receive land
titles. This activity has facilitated land-use planning in the PCW.

Implementation strategy for one of the watersheds7 (2010 data)

Developed management plans for thirty farms along the Pacora River11

Plan for Sustainable Development and Integrated Water Resource
Management “to promote watershed management in order to raise the
standard of living of the PCW’s inhabitants without compromising the
Canal’s future needs and constant water production in the amount and
quality necessary for running the waterway and human consumption.”8

The ACP has also played an active role in building the capacity of residents
to protect the PCW. For instance, in collaboration with the Institute for
Professional Formation and Human Resources Development and the
Ministry of Education, the ACP carried out conservation and job-training
programs for more than 5,666 residents.
In regard to agriculture, the ACP has worked with the Ministry of
Agriculture Development of Panama (MIDA) to train more than 1,100
producers on sustainable agricultural and livestock practices. The ACP has
also worked with MIDA to introduce green agroforestry models for
shade-grown coffee and cacao production in the PCW.
The ACP receives international and national support for these programs,
but also allocates a portion of its annual budget toward community
initiatives. In addition to annual financial commitments, USAID assisted in
the establishment of a Fund for the Conservation and Recuperation of the
Canal Watershed to ensure long-term conservation. This fund supports
projects in the following areas: reforestation, agro-forestry, natural habitat
management, reduction of sources of pollution, basic community
sanitations, liquid and solid waste control, soil conservation, ecotourism,
land titling and unified cadastre, and development of sustainable
agricultural techniques.12

With the support of National and international funds, ANAM has
undertaken several small-scale adaptation and mitigation programs,
including:

Panama Canal:

• A
 program to capture rainwater in areas without ample water
resources (Guna Yala and Ngäbe Buglé among other areas)
• Climate change vulnerability studies and installing equipment to
monitor the impact of climate change in two watershed

As part of the expansion project design process, the ACP conducted
extensive statistical modeling to evaluate the potential availability of
water for navigation and potable use during droughts that might
occur due to climate change influences within the next 17 years. The
data analysis included historical rainfall and stream flow patterns,
including three very significant ENSO events (that is, extreme
droughts), which occurred over the last 30 years of operation. Using
a 99 percent confidence interval, the evaluation concluded that
sufficient water will be available for both Canal operation and potable
use for growth in population through the year 2025.13
The ACP is working with the National Civil Defense System and local
communities to build risk management capacity.

Knowledge
Gaps and
Areas for
Development

In 2010, ANAM highlighted the following knowledge gaps and areas for
development:

In addition to a continued commitment to on-going activities, areas for
further development include:

•

Panama has made significant progress in reducing poverty in recent years, progress that compares positively to
that of the rest of the Latin America and Caribbean region.
This report takes stock of this progress and reflects on the constraints and opportunities that Panama faces
in continuing on its path of shared prosperity and poverty reduction. The education and skills agenda, energy,
public sector reform, the inclusion of indigenous peoples, and water management are identified as areas that
will require attention to ensure the sustainability of Panama’s success story.
Following a detailed analysis of poverty—recent trends, drivers of poverty reduction, and demographic ­factors—
the report provides foundations to answer three main questions:
•
•
•

What has driven growth in Panama in recent years?
To what extent has this growth been, or not been, inclusive?
How sustainable is the growth and more generally, the development model of Panama?
