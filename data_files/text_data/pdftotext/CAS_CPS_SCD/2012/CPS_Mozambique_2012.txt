EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Overall Context. The launch of the proposed Mozambique Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY12-15 comes at a momentous period in the country’s impressive post-conflict journey; one which
many analysts suggest has propelled the nation to a unique point of inflection. The optimism that
accompanied the previous CPS for FY08-11, after two decades of growth and poverty reduction, has been
replaced by sober but purposeful deliberation over Mozambique’s path to development. In recent years,
Government and donors have had to grapple with a deceleration of poverty reduction in the face of strong
growth; social unrest that closely preceded those in the Arab world; a drop in the Human Development
Index and Doing Business country rankings, and the broader perception of reform deceleration; the
likelihood of increased pressure and decreased aid among bilateral donors; and serious capacity
constraints to manage increasingly important natural resources, including significant coal and newly
discovered gas deposits which by all accounts will be a ―game changer‖ for Mozambique’s future. Thus,
while significant challenges of sustaining stability and building a more equitable society persist, the
upside potential of leveraging its strong post-conflict performance towards transformative growth in the
medium to longer-term, is enormous and almost second to none in Sub-Saharan Africa.
ii.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects. Since the end of the two-decade long civil war
in 1992, Mozambique has had to play catch up with the rest of the world. Macroeconomic stability,
structural reforms, and reconstruction drove post-conflict growth which has been sustained over the past
decade by enclave mega-projects in mining and energy production. The country has weathered the global
economic and financial crises, with economic growth dipping to 6.3 percent in 2009 but projected to have
risen to 7.2 percent in 2011. Increased infrastructure spending as well as foreign investments in new
mega-projects are expected to drive economic growth to 8 percent over the medium-term.
iii.
Development Challenges. The deceleration of poverty reduction in the face of robust economic
growth is the defining development challenge in today’s Mozambique. The challenge is to diversify the
sources of economic growth; integrate capital-intensive mega-projects with the Government’s poverty
reduction strategy; and develop the agriculture sector which employs close to 80 percent of the workforce
but remains largely unproductive, subsistence-based, and where there is a growing ―feminization of
poverty.‖ More broadly, Mozambique needs to accelerate investment climate reforms; improve provision
of public goods to facilitate inclusive growth (e.g., infrastructure, education, health); set up well-targeted
safety nets for the most vulnerable; and promote greater voice and citizen participation while building
transparent and accountable systems, including those related to extractive industries.
iv.
Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Plano de Acção de Redução de Pobreza
(PARP) for 2011-14 is the third Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and aims to reinvigorate the
poverty reduction agenda to foster more inclusive growth. It specifically recognizes the empowerment of
women as a decisive factor in poverty eradication and economic growth. Acknowledging the need to
diversify sources of growth, the PARP looks to complement efforts to improve service delivery with an
economic strategy to boost productivity in labor-intensive sectors and unleash the structural
transformation of the economy. The PARP is built on three main pillars: (a) increasing production and
productivity for the agricultural and fisheries sectors; (b) promoting employment; and (c) fostering human
and social development. Two supporting pillars focus on good governance and macroeconomic stability.

1

v.
Lessons Learned. The CPS Completion Report (CR) in Annex 2 identified the following lessons:
(a) an appropriate program of analytic work to underpin Bank programs and projects is needed to inform
public debate on key development issues, including the entry points for economic transformation; (b) the
CPS should be a living document and updated and monitored at mid-term with updated monitoring
indicators; (c) Bank lending instruments should be chosen and sequenced more strategically to address
sectoral bottlenecks and implementation capacity constraints; and (d) staffing and management vacancies
affected the overall program delivery and results, and should have been addressed more expeditiously.
vi.
CPS Pillars and Outcomes. The CPS for FY12-15 takes as its starting point the Government’s
PARP, with its theme of inclusive and broad-based growth. The Africa Regional Strategy also provides
an overall framework for setting priorities and managing the proposed program. Like the Africa Regional
Strategy, the CPS has two cross-cutting pillars and a foundation:
Competitiveness and employment. In view of structural issues and growth and poverty trends,
the Bank looks to help improve the regulatory environment; prioritize investments through spatial
planning; enhance agricultural productivity and employment in potential growth sectors; improve
provision of transport, water, energy, and other infrastructure; and promote an educated, skilled,
and healthy workforce.
Vulnerability and resilience. Given the country’s susceptibility to idiosyncratic and exogenous
shocks, the Bank aims to help improve health services for the vulnerable; strengthen social
protection; and encourage climate change adaptation and reduce vulnerability to natural disasters.
Governance and public sector capacity. Key to achieving the country’s development objectives
is improved public financial management, particularly at the sector and local levels; improved
citizen participation in service delivery monitoring; greater contribution of wildlife conservation to
the economy; and improved transparency in extractive industries.
In addition, the CPS aims to mainstream gender, social accountability, and nutrition in the portfolio. On
gender, the Bank will build on an already solid track record of addressing gender equality during project
preparation and implementation. There is broad scope to introduce social accountability mechanisms,
particularly in projects seeking to improve service delivery. A parallel strategy to incorporate social
accountability is currently under discussion. Similarly, with chronic malnutrition among the worst in the
world, nutrition-related activities are planned for active and pipeline operations, as appropriate.
vii. CPS Program and Resources. The CPS for FY12-15 will be supported by IDA 16: the notional
envelope is US$1.04 billion for the first three years of the CPS period. IDA resources will continue to be
supplemented by trust funds, parallel and basket financing, and used strategically to catalyze and leverage
donor and private sector financing. Given the potential for the mineral and gas sectors, agribusiness,
tourism, and other sectors, as well as the Government’s desire for the Bank to be a catalyst for large and
complex infrastructure projects, the Bank will look at the range of instruments, including IBRD enclave
financing, and will ensure coherence and complementarity with IFC and MIGA. The Bank will also
generate greater knowledge products, including South-South knowledge exchange across a range of areas.
viii. Risks. Risks include: (a) weak government capacity to coordinate and implement key cross
sectoral reforms and operations, and to manage the extractive industry sector, including private sector
participation; (b) elevated social tensions particularly among urban unemployed youth; (c)

2

macroeconomic shocks and their impact on the Government’s reform program; and (d) reduced donor
aid.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
1.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-15 will be implemented during a period of
inflection in Mozambique’s history. Over the medium-term, the country has an opportunity to lay the
basis for a marked transformation of its social and economic structure. For now, the latest household
survey indicates that despite impressive growth rates over two decades, the pace of poverty reduction has
been disappointing.1 Social unrest in recent years underlines the vulnerability of large segments of the
population and is the impetus behind a more inclusive growth strategy. The CPS will also coincide with
the final push to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): many are within reach but
will require a determined effort by all stakeholders. Meanwhile, Mozambique is at the cusp of a major
―game changer‖ in the form of its vast mining and oil and gas sectors, which are at world-class scale and
could generate sizeable resources for needed public investments in the long run. The next two years will
be a critical window to make the appropriate policy and investment decisions that will shape the natural
resources sector for the next generation. But attention to this and to the broader development agenda will
be tested by a potentially disruptive political cycle, with the Frelimo Party convention and municipal and
presidential elections taking place over the next three years. In sum, the medium-term outlook is fraught
with both unmatched opportunities and persistent downside risks.

A. Political Context
2.
Mozambique, a southeast African country of 22.9 million people, occupies an area of 800,000
square kilometers. About 70 percent of the population live and work in rural areas. The country has
more than 2,500 kilometers of coastline along the southwestern rim of the Indian Ocean. It is endowed
with ample arable land, water, energy, and gas and mineral resources; three deep seaports; and a relatively
large potential labor pool. It is also strategically located, bordering six countries — four of them
landlocked and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets. In addition, the
country’s strong ties to the regional economic engine of South Africa underscore the importance of
Mozambique’s economic, political, and social development to the stability and growth of the region.
3.
Following independence from Portugal in June 1975, the country underwent a protracted 15year armed conflict, fueled largely by regional powers and Cold War politics, leaving the country
and its economy in ruins. Mozambique began a slow but successful transition to peace, political
stability, and democracy in the late-1980s and two years after the formal peace agreement in October
1992, the country held its first democratic elections. The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
(Frelimo) edged out its civil war rival, the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo). Frelimo has
remained in power ever since, most recently winning the fourth presidential and parliamentary elections
in 2009 by 70 percent of the popular vote (an increase from the 60 percent garnered in the 2004
elections). Frelimo has a two-thirds majority in the national parliament, 80 percent of the seats in the
provincial assemblies, and majorities in all elected municipal assemblies. Such control over the elected

3

and politically appointed state positions is unparalleled in the country's recent history. Political analysts
predict it could undermine the Government's ability to respond to the needs of its citizens.
4.
Looking ahead, the next three years will be marked by several political milestones that could
distract from the country’s development agenda. The political jockeying ahead of Frelimo’s party
convention in 2012 has been accompanied by discussion over the future ideological tilt of the party, given
the emergence of a new generation of leaders with no connection to the struggle for independence and
little allegiance to the Socialist ideals of the party’s founders. There is also some talk about a possible
constitutional amendment to extend presidential term limits which may cause dissention within the party.
The 2013 municipal elections will also be highly anticipated and will determine whether the Democratic
Movement of Mozambique (MDM), an off-shoot of Renamo, can build on its control of two of the largest
municipalities (Beira and Quelimane) and emerge as a serious force in Mozambican politics. Both
Renamo and MDM’s power base lies in the central provinces of Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia – often
referred to as ―Mozambique’s breadbasket‖.

B. Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
5.
For the past two decades since the end of the civil war, Mozambique recorded a sustained
and impressive rate of growth. Average real GDP growth rate soared from zero percent during the
1981-92 period to 8 percent between 1993 and 2010; and real GDP per capita almost doubled after 1992,
making Mozambique one of the best performing countries over the past two decades among African oil
importers (Figure 1). While growth in the immediate aftermath of the peace accords was driven by a
return to political and macroeconomic stability, a first wave of structural reforms, and a post-conflict
―catch-up effect‖ in infrastructure and agriculture, more recent growth (since 1998) has been driven by
policies to entice foreign investments, particularly in isolated mega-projects in mining and energy
production, and strong donor support. Foreign direct investment totaled US$890 million in 2009 and
increased to US$1 billion in 2010. These flows support the growing perception of Mozambique as a
market-oriented economy with strong prospects for structural transformation and high growth.
6.
Economic growth has remained
Figure 1. Mozambique Growth Record 1993-2012
relatively strong albeit with some slow
down during the global food, fuel, and
financial crises and consequent global
economic slowdown since 2008. While the
country’s real GDP growth rate fell slightly
to 6.3 percent in 2009, it rose to 6.8 percent
in 2010 and is estimated to have increased to
7.2 percent in 2011. The country’s economic
growth has remained one of the strongest in
the region, outpacing not only the SubSaharan average but also that of the other Source: Estimates and projections from Government of Mozambique,
so-called
―frontier
economies‖.2 IMF, and World Bank.
Mozambique’s resilience in large part reflects the Government’s rapid and flexible policy responses,

Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.

4

including measures to rationalize expenditures for non-priority sectors, and monetary policy aimed at
limiting the impact of the higher public debt on credit to the private sector. With economic growth now
back on a sound footing, the Government has started tightening macroeconomic policies, reverting from
the expansionary stance adopted during the global economic crisis to address the double-digit inflation
that Mozambique had in 2010. Inflation in 2011 fell to 5.5 percent.
7.
Mozambique's rapid economic growth has not translated into significant poverty reduction in
recent years. Growth was accompanied by significant strides in reducing poverty up to 2003. Household
survey data indicate that the national poverty headcount fell from roughly 69 to 54 percent from 1996 to
2003. The results of the 2008-09 household survey suggest the response of poverty reduction to
economic growth has since weakened. The geographical distribution of poverty, however, continues to
be concentrated in the rural areas, and in the center and northern part of the country.
8.
The medium-term outlook for Mozambique remains positive. Increased public investments,
particularly in infrastructure, as well as foreign investments in new mega-projects in the energy sector and
extractive industries are expected to drive economic growth to 8 percent over the medium term, putting
the country back on its pre-global crisis trajectory (Table 1). Investment spending is already at about 15
percent of GDP in 2011 and an expansion is necessary given the country’s low physical capital stock.
Given low private investment rates, the Government may need non-concessional external resources.
Emphasis should be placed on the quality of projects so as to ensure an adequate growth dividend and
ability to repay additional borrowing. Such efforts would need to be embedded in a continued pursuit of
macroeconomic stability.
9.
The World Bank and the IMF have recently upgraded Mozambique as a Higher Capacity
Country in terms of its non-concessional borrowing capacity. This is a result of improvements in subCountry Policy and Institutional Assessment (sub-CPIA) and Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) scores, as well as the significant progress achieved in terms of debt management,
including the formulation of medium term debt strategies and the preparation of annual debt sustainability
analyses. Higher borrowing capacity should serve Mozambique well as it looks to increase public
investment in infrastructure over the medium-term. Aid flows, including direct budget support, have
remained strong but have been falling from their peak in 2009, as a percent of a fast growing GDP, and
are estimated to level off in 2012.
10. Recent discoveries of coal and gas resources indicate that over the medium-term
Mozambique's development could receive a very significant boost. Mozambique has the potential to
join the ranks of resource rich economies especially if the exploitation of natural gas resources
materializes. This could be transformative, providing government with significant resources and altering
the geographic distribution of development which is now heavily centered in the southern part of the
country. Government's attention to EITI, public financial management, and the continued strengthening
of tax administration is a good basis, but will need to be complemented with stronger attention to polices
to support economic diversification and strengthening government's ability to deliver services.
11. Despite an overall positive economic outlook, the Mozambican economy faces substantial
downside risks, particularly with regards to a slowdown in international economic growth. The
increased risks posed by the deteriorating global environment and the negative impacts it would bring to
the country – as prices of commodities decline resulting in lower export revenues, foreign investment
5

retracts, and economic activity slows down – will also result in lower tax revenues. The main
transmission channels of a significant downturn in the global economy (and especially from a recession in
Europe) would result in lower commodity prices and its effects on growth through lower foreign direct
investment to resource-rich Mozambique. In addition, the important trade links to South Africa (including
aluminum exports and imports of consumer goods) could have a wider effect through the bilateral
exchange rate.

12. Under an alternative global growth scenario, assuming the downside risk of a global
slowdown, Mozambique's growth is projected to decelerate with growing fiscal and external
imbalances. Assuming a decline in GDP in developed countries of about 1 percent and almost stagnant
overall global growth, real GDP growth in Mozambique is projected to fall by 1.8 percentage points in
2012 and by 1.6 percent in 2013 (compared to the baseline scenario). Also, under this alternative
scenario, the global downturn is projected to add pressure to the fiscal accounts as fiscal revenues fall
faster than spending and the external current account deficit to widen slightly as lower external demand
and falling commodity prices are expected to affect exports. Mozambique also remains vulnerable to
changing global food and fuel prices, given the moderate fiscal capacity to moderate its impact on
domestic prices.

C. Millennium Development Goals and Poverty
13. As the country moves closer to 2015, Government and stakeholders are looking to make a
final push to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The country can potentially
achieve 13 of the 21 MDG targets by 2015 (Table 2). Those within reach relate to poverty, under-five
mortality, maternal mortality, and the establishment of an open trading and financial system. Improved
public financial management (PFM) and massive investment in priority areas have helped to improve
service delivery in education, health, transport, and infrastructure, resulting in progress across a range of
non-monetary poverty indicators. Enrolment and attendance rates over the past decade have increased
6

significantly; 81 percent of primary school-age children (6-12 years) attend school, with only a two
percentage-point difference between boys slightly outnumbering girls. Overall, the achievement
represents one of the most significant improvements in gender equality in the country over the past
decade. Net enrolment in all grades of EP1 (escola primária do primeiro grau, level 1 up to grade 5)
increased from 45 to 77 percent during 1998-2008, and the completion rate increased from 39 percent in
2003 to 73 percent in 2010.

14. Progress has been made from a low base in the health sector, but many challenges remain,
including inequality in access and health outcomes, and require sustained commitment. The underfive mortality rate decreased from 178 to 138 per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2008 due to
7

improved vaccination rates and service coverage. Maternal mortality has decreased from an estimated
1,000 to 340 per 100,000 between the early 1990s and 2007. Despite these significant improvements,
Mozambique fares less well than the Sub-Saharan Africa average. HIV appears to have stabilized at a
prevalence rate of 11.5 percent among 15-49 year olds, still among the highest prevalence rates in the
world, and adolescent girls are 3 times more likely than adolescent boys to be infected by HIV. Married
women have limited ability to negotiate safe sexual practices (such as condom use) and are at greatest risk
of contracting HIV. The Bank estimates that the high prevalence rate may reduce Mozambique’s
economic growth by as much as one percentage point annually. And the Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that Mozambique may lose more than 20 percent of its agricultural labor force by
2020 because of the epidemic. Coverage of malaria prevention methods, such as insecticide-treated nets,
has also improved. Nonetheless, malaria continues to pose a major public health problem, accounting for
a large proportion of deaths among children under-five. It is also a contributing factor to at least 30
percent of maternal deaths. All regions of the country remain at high risk of transmission, requiring
coverage to be further improved and sustained over the long-term. 3
15. Chronic malnutrition is extremely high. In Mozambique, approximately 47 percent of children
under five suffer from chronic under-nutrition (or stunting), a rate that has remained virtually unchanged
since 2003 and is considered "very high" by World Health Organization standards. Chronic undernutrition accounts for at least one-third of child deaths. Stunting affects individual children but is also
closely linked to overall development of a country as stunting affects cognitive development and is
related to timely school enrolment and future educational outcomes. This high burden of under-nutrition
stems from soaring levels of poverty, food insecurity, poor child-feeding practices, and inadequate
prevention and management of acute illnesses.
16. The Mozambique health system is weak in general, with particular challenges in human
resources, healthcare financing and supply chain management. Mozambique has the fifth lowest
ratio of health workers to population (0.03 doctors, and 0.21 nurses per 1,000 inhabitants). There are 26
donors in the health sector, making predictability and coordination difficult. Government allocation to
health spending has recently decreased, and public financial management needs to improve. Poor
management of the supply chain has resulted in expired drugs in central warehouses at the same time as
drug stock-outs at health facilities. Challenges outside of the health system also have a heavy impact on
health status. While 77 percent of people in urban areas had access to improved drinking water sources in
2008, this fell to 29 percent for rural populations (48 percent overall). Among rural households, only six
percent have access to safe sanitation compared to 47 percent of urban households.
17. Significant challenges in education remain. Progress in school enrolment masks challenges in
the quality of education, with 44 percent of children in primary schools being over-age and only 1 in 5
children of secondary school age actually attending secondary school. Gender parity has been achieved in
school enrolment, but there are more out-of-school girls than boys. Especially significant, gender gaps
remain in the higher grades of primary education (EP2, escola primária do segundo grau, grades 6 to 7) and
secondary education. This is particularly pronounced in the Northern provinces where low literacy rates
persist for women of ages 15-24. Adult literacy rate for women is only 41 percent compared to 70 percent

for men.4 For women, this is far below average rates of neighboring countries. Key issues that influence
girls’ retention in the education system — beside the wealth of their family — are premature marriages,
dominance of male teachers and inherent fear of sexual harassment, and distance to water supply systems.
18. Despite significant progress, the
provision of water remains a major Figure 2. Poverty Headcount by Sex of Household Head
challenge in Mozambique. Although the and Urban-Rural Areas
share of people with access to safe drinking
water in urban areas has increased
significantly and achieving the MDG target
for sustainable coverage is expected for urban
water supply (reaching 70 percent), overall
access remains low. The 47 percent with
access to water is below the average of 58
percent across the African continent. This is
mainly because coverage in rural areas, which
accounts for 73 percent of the total population,
is low at 30 percent compared to the African Source: Inquérito Sobre Orçamento Familiar 2008/09 (Instituto
average of 46.5 percent. Among rural Nacional de Estatística, 2010)
households, only 6 percent have access to safe
sanitation compared to 47 percent of urban households.
19.
The uneven progress on the MDGs mirrors the challenges in sustaining broad-based poverty
reduction. Mozambique's rapid economic growth was accompanied by significant strides in poverty
reduction in the decade following the civil war. Poverty rates fell from 69 percent in 1996-97 to 54
percent in 2002-03 — equivalent to nearly three million people (or 13 percent of the country’s
population) lifted out of poverty. Despite this success, Mozambique needs to further decrease the poverty
rate by 15 percentage points to achieve the MDG target of 40 percent of the population below the poverty
line by 2015. Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 184 out of 187
countries in the 2011 Human Development Index.5 It ranks 197 out of 210 countries in GDP per capita
(US$441 in 2010, compared to the US$510 average for low-income countries).6 Moreover, the results of
the 2008-09 household survey, while subject to some methodological caveats, suggest overall poverty
reduction has remained at roughly 54 percent of the population, with rural poverty actually increasing
slightly to 57 percent since the 2002-03 survey.7 While the food and fuel crisis of 2008-09 played a role
in this outcome, the poverty trend suggests that growth has become less inclusive in recent years.

Box 1. Mozambican Development from a Gender Perspective
Since Independence, Government policies have emphasized gender equality and women’s empowerment and
some have contributed to important development results. They include drastically improved gender gaps in
schooling and significant reductions in infant and under-five child mortality. There has also been a notable
increase in women’s political representation (ranked 61 out of 116 countries under the Gender Empowerment
Measure). However, women continue to live and work at a disadvantage under a strong patriarchal culture that
hinders their optimal benefit from and contribution to economic and social development achievements. Compared
with men, women still have heavier workload responsibilities, inferior employment and lower income, inferior
access to land and lower agricultural production, and lower levels of education and health. Gender-based violence
continues to be a fundamental obstacle to the achievement of gender equality; and while one of Africa’s best
performing economies, Mozambique has experienced a ―feminization‖ of poverty and the agricultural sector.
An important aspect of the ―feminization‖ of poverty is that women stay in the agricultural, informal sector and
low paid occupations while men are moving to pursue higher earnings in other sectors. Trends between 1997 and
2003 show that men moved out of agriculture and into the private sector and self-employment in non-agricultural
sectors to a higher degree than women.a Women are also less likely than men to grow tradable crops because they
concentrate on basic foods to feed their familyb and women experience lower technology adoption rates than
men.c This gender gap not only has important implication on equity, social cohesion and individual welfare, it
also creates important economic inefficiencies. Strategies are needed to specifically help women diversify crops
and raise output to a commercial scale without risking household food security, for example through extension
services targeting women. Another finding shows that women with education do move into commercial
agriculture, underlining the multiple advantages of enhancing access to education among rural women.d

20. The 2011 Gender Inequality Index8 ranks Mozambique 125 out of 146 countries, revealing
that Mozambique remains poor in overall as well as in gender equality terms. 9 Gender of the
household head is a major determinant of poverty in Mozambique. According to the Social and Gender
Assessment and using data from the 2002-03 household survey, it has been observed that households with
low consumption levels tend to be larger, have a higher proportion of children, and live in rural areas; and
their head of households work in the agriculture sector and have a lower education level. Households
headed by females tend to be poorer than those headed by males.10 Of families headed by women, 57.8
percent fall below the poverty line, compared to 53.9 percent of those headed by men. Yet, as seen in
Figure 2, one of the most significant outcomes of the 2008-09 household survey relates to gender: femaleheaded households are experiencing a more consistent drop in poverty rate than male-headed households,
8

UNDP’s Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects women’s disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health,
empowerment and the labour market. The health dimension is measured by two indicators: maternal mortality
ratio and the adolescent fertility rate. The empowerment dimension is also measured by two indicators: the share
of parliamentary seats held by each sex and by secondary and higher education attainment levels. The labour
dimension is measured by women’s participation in the work force.

particularly in urban areas.11 Key gender analyses conclude that there is a ―feminization of poverty‖ in
Mozambique.12 The overall proportion of female-headed households is at 26.4 percent, but it ranges
between 54 percent in the southern province of Gaza to 21 percent in the two most populous northern
provinces of Nampula and Zambézia.13
21. Growth in Mozambique has not been as pro-poor as in other high-growth countries and it
has become less pro-poor over time. When compared to peer countries, GDP growth has had less of an
effect in reducing the headline poverty rate.14 Despite a healthy pace of growth, the current elasticity of
poverty reduction with respect to mean income (about 1.5) will lead to only very slow poverty reduction
over the next decade. In a country with no social safety nets and where half of the population is under 20
years old (Figure 3), 80 percent of the labor force in informal or subsistence, low-productivity activities,
that baseline scenario would be a recipe for sociopolitical tensions. The September 2010 riots, following
the Government’s announced price increases for bread, water, and electricity, underlined the extreme
vulnerability of the country’s population. The aftermath of the riots have also prompted the Government
and the donor community alike to place greater emphasis in developing rural areas where about 60
percent of the population lives, and to promote labor-intensive growth, particularly in the agriculture
sector which employs 78 percent of the workforce and is an obvious engine for sustained and
transformative growth and poverty reduction. At the same time, the Government is mindful of the high
and growing risks associated with urban unemployment and poverty — driven by rural migration and
high population growth — and the potential for social unrest.

challenge of creating employment opportunities for its fast growing and young labor force. Using

15 to 59 as the working age, the labor force in Mozambique will increase by almost 50 percent during the
22 years from now to 2025, from about 8 million in 2010 to about 11.6 million in 2025. While
Mozambique’s employment to population ratio currently stands at 78 percent, job creation in the nonagricultural modern wage sector has not kept up with labor force growth. Moreover, the country’s human
capital base is quite thin: more than 90 percent of the labor force has either no formal education or only 5
years of formal education.

D. Development Challenges and Opportunities
23. Slow poverty reduction in the face of robust economic growth is the defining development
challenge in today’s Mozambique.

Promoting Inclusive Growth to Enhance Job Creation
24. Recent poverty outcomes can be attributed in part to low growth in agricultural productivity
(especially food crops), weather shocks affecting the 2008 harvests, and increase in international
food and fuel prices. However, more broadly, slow poverty reduction reflects the structural deficiencies
and the narrow productive base of the economy, the inadequacy of the Government’s growth strategy, and
the breadth of the investment climate reform agenda left to be addressed. For some time there has been
broad agreement that the drivers of growth in the recent past — the post-conflict catch-up effect and
overseas development assistance — were bound to fade over time; and long-run productivity growth
needs to replace them. However, growth in the past decade has been concentrated at one end of the
productive spectrum: foreign-owned, capital-intensive, and export-oriented mega-projects. Mega-projects
have contributed significantly to Mozambique’s economic growth and have put the country on the map as
an attractive destination for international investors, but they have had limited impact on employment
creation and productivity spillovers. While representing 62 percent of the production value of the
manufacturing sector, mega-projects only employ 3 percent of the sector’s labor force and 2 percent of
urban private sector employment.15 Mega-projects dominate Mozambique’s exports, about half of which
derive from the aluminum smelting mega-project, making the economy highly dependent on world
commodity prices. There are only 14 other products registering exports in excess of US$1 million.16
Also, mega-projects have had limited fiscal benefits — a legacy of the Government’s tax incentives to
lure foreign investors.
25. Inclusive growth calls for better integration of mega-projects into the overall socio-economic
development strategy, but Mozambique must also develop broader and more diverse sources of
growth. The country has a vast potential for diversification. Box 2 assesses options for diversifying
sources of growth. Beyond mining and energy, the untapped development of agribusiness, fisheries,
forestry, tourism, trade and logistics, light manufacturing and services holds significant potential in terms
of growth but also job creation and livelihoods. In order to encourage a structural transformation of the
economy and a more competitive and diversified productive and export base to emerge, the Government
of Mozambique needs to accelerate reforms to improve both the overall investment climate and to

Private Sector, World Bank, 2009).

12

untangle sector-specific bottlenecks in potential growth areas. At the same time, Mozambique needs to
maintain its strong track record of macroeconomic stability, particularly in the face of continued global
economic uncertainty; boost public investment in infrastructure as a way to crowd in private sector
activity and improve the quality of life and productivity of its citizens; and enhance the competitiveness
of the local workforce through improved education and skills development. More than 90 percent of the
labor force has either no formal education or only five years of formal education.
Box 2. Growth Identification and Facilitation in Mozambique
The key questions for the country’s economic agenda are whether high growth rates can be sustained and even
increased to levels that would ensure prosperity for Mozambicans, and what strategic policy choices and tradeoffs
are needed in order to get there. Among the many challenges facing the country, lifting the 80 percent of the
population currently in low-productivity or subsistence activities into industries that conform to the country’s
comparative advantage is probably the most important one.
At the request of the Mozambican authorities, a World Bank team is currently preparing jointly with the
Government a Policy note on the appropriate way of identifying new sources of growth, and some specifics on the
facilitation role that the state should play. The work will feed into a high level ―Jobs Summit‖ to mobilize global
experience on job creation through growth facilitation.
Preliminary results of the analysis suggest that Mozambique has several options at its disposal:
Option A: Fostering current policies to exploit the country's large energy, and gas and mineral resources. The
risk, however, is price volatility. Heavy reliance on aluminum, for example, which accounts for about onethird of exports, subjects the economy to the sharp declines in aluminum prices that the country experienced
during the 2008-10 global economic crisis.
Option B: Strengthening the emerging agri-business sector, which is already attracting strong interest and high
levels of foreign investment, often from countries such as Brazil where there is deep knowledge and expertise.
Mozambique is endowed with ample arable land and water and could certainly establish itself as a powerhouse
in agri-business industries. This option could transform the rural economy, where over 2/3 of Mozambique's
poor households live, owing to linkages and spillovers to the traditional farming sector.
Option C: Developing light manufacturing industries-and trying to seize some of the 85 million low-skilled
manufacturing jobs that China will have to graduate from in the next decade due to its fast-rising wages.
Mozambique has a relatively large potential labor pool and manufacturing provides more long-term economic
benefits than other activities. It generates economies of scale, sparks industrial and technological upgrading,
fosters innovation, and is characterized by big multiplier effects. This option would reduce urban poverty and
have spillovers to rural areas as well through informal transfers.
Option D: Positioning itself as a regional hub. Mozambique is also strategically located, bordering six
countries - four of them landlocked and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets. In
addition, it has three deep seaports, more than 2,500 kilometers of coastline along the southwestern rim of the
Indian Ocean, and strong ties to the regional economic engine of South Africa.
Option E: Developing tourism to make it one of the main sources of foreign exchange and growth. The
potential is virtually unlimited. If combined with programs to develop the required skills in the labor force, this
option could lead to substantial employment gains, but would not reach the majority of the labor force. It
would work best in combination with others.
For each one of these options, two main obstacles will have to be overcome: high factor costs (often due to poorlyconceived regulations and rigidities in land policy) and high transaction costs (often due to insufficient
infrastructure and poor governance). By facilitating the clustering of competitive private firms in some geographic
locations with excellent logistics (without using the distortionary instruments of old industrial policies such as
tariffs or other forms of heavy protection), the government could foster the backward and forward linkages that
will bring capital and knowledge to the Mozambican economy.

13

26.
The magnitude and complexity of the reform agenda requires stronger development
planning, management, and oversight. The Government has already begun a series of measures and
reforms, such as tightening the fiscal regime for large investments and mega-projects to ensure mineral
revenues are at comparable levels to other resource-rich countries and to bring them more in line with
current international good practice. Higher mineral revenues would, in turn, support the stepped up
infrastructure and education investments needed to improve competitiveness over the medium to long
term, as well as institute effective social protection programs.17
Box 3. Opportunities and Perils of Mozambique’s Burgeoning Extractive Industry
Mozambique is at the cusp of becoming a world-class destination for mining and gas. For the latter, the next
two years will be a critical window to put in place policies and investments that will shape the sector for the next
30 to 40 years. Exploration in the Rovuma basin in 2010-11 first confirmed the presence of natural gas volumes
in excess of 30 Tcf (comparable to Oman), and more recent announcements by investors increased that potential
estimate to between 80 and 100 Tcf (comparable to Norway).a Mozambique already plays an important role in
the world’s production of aluminum and beryllium. Its massive coal reserves could eventually place
Mozambique at par with the largest coal exporters in the world.
The extractive industries sector currently accounts for about 5 percent of the country’s GDP, primarily from gas,
with a limited share from mining. However, the country has only just begun to tap into its huge potential.
Expectations are that in 5 to 10 years, coal and natural gas projects alone could double the sector’s contribution
to GDP. With over 1,000 active prospecting and exploration licenses, the mining and oil and gas sectors have
the potential to contribute additionally up to 10 percent of GDP (based on global comparators). Large-scale
mining and petroleum operations provide a unique opportunity unlike other industry sectors to bring in private
financing for development of regional infrastructure to facilitate local value addition and business development
that could serve as ―anchors‖ for growth corridors development.
One key challenge facing the country for harnessing its natural resource opportunities is to design the right
strategic policies in a context that supports a sound sector governance, legal, and regulatory regime; linkages to
the broader economy; and fiscal prudence. Another challenge is to minimize macroeconomic distortions and the
negative impacts (―the resource curse‖) seen in other resource-rich countries. These include a decline in the
competitiveness of other economic sectors (due to real exchange rate appreciation), volatility of revenues from
the natural resource sector due to global commodity market swings, government mismanagement of resources,
and weak or corrupt institutions. To avoid the latter, the Government of Mozambique made a commitment to
increase transparency and accountability in the management of extractive industries. On May 15, 2009,
Mozambique became an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Candidate Country. The country is
undergoing EITI validation, which assesses compliance with EITI principles and standards. As of 2011,
Mozambique has largely passed the first stage of reforms by establishing a sound legal and regulatory regime
and generating modern, high-quality geodata. The second-generation reforms that Mozambique is facing can
produce the highest results in terms of revenues to the country by ensuring that exploration turns into mines, that
mines produce in accordance with the plans, and that mines pay their dues in accordance with the laws and
regulations. Technical assistance for the extractive industries and specific support for a ―master plan‖ for the gas
sector are also planned under the CPS.

27. The Government is also looking to improve the impact of mega-projects on employment and
revenues, as well as greater linkages with local enterprises. More generally, the Government is keen to
improve land use, strengthen mining law and regulations, manage offshore gas development, revise the
Public-Private Partnership Law, and improve public financial management to deliver effective services
that facilitate growth. In this regard, the Government is looking at spatial development planning to
improve efforts to set the proper enabling conditions for private sector investment and public-privatecommunity partnerships in developing or underdeveloped regions or ―corridors‖ that demonstrate
potential for growth. While limited capacity to undertake such level of development will continue to be a
concern, the potential for better planned, integrated, and managed development that spurs inclusive
growth shows considerable promise. Box 3 discusses the potential for development of Mozambique’s
extractive industry.

Investment Climate
28. Despite efforts to improve the investment climate, Mozambique still ranks low on
international indicators of economic competitiveness and business environment. In the 2012 Doing
Business Index, for example, Mozambique ranked 139 out of 183 countries. This is despite recent reforms
related to business licensing and registration for smaller business.18 New business owners in
Mozambique still have to go through an extensive bureaucratic process to formally register their business.
It also remains particularly costly and/or burdensome to deal with construction permits, employ workers,
register property, trade across borders, and enforce contracts. Similarly, in the World Economic Forum’s
Global Competitiveness Report 2010-2011, Mozambique ranked 131 out of 139 countries in terms of
economic competitiveness.19 Poor access to finance, the perceived prevalence of corruption, inefficient
government bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure, and the education level of the workforce were
regarded as particularly challenging. The World Bank Investment Climate Assessment released in 2009
also found that the top private sector constraints in Mozambique were shown to be access to finance,
practices of the informal sector, inadequate electricity supply; high tax rates; and crime, theft, and
disorder.20 The shortage of technical skills is a particular constraint to local economic development, and
other concerns may be even more acute in the provinces outside the capital. Despite some modest reforms
in the trade area, Mozambique’s ranking in the 2010 Global Logistics Performance Index is 136 out of
155 countries surveyed.21 This contrasts sharply with South Africa, which is ranked 28 in the same
survey. Trade facilitation reforms would also go a long way for Mozambique to play its natural role as the
gateway for trade for the Southern Africa region.
29. The weak business environment has a particularly negative impact on small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs). About 90 percent of all private businesses in Mozambique are small to medium-size
enterprises. Over-regulation, administrative procedures, and rigid labor laws discourage most of these
firms from formal registration, putting them in a very tenuous position. Most employ less than 10

employees, sell mostly to the local market, operate with very low profit margins, face severe resource
constraints, offer few opportunities for savings and investment to escape poverty, and contribute modestly
to exports and economic growth. Supporting small and medium-size enterprises would necessarily have
to focus on improving access to finance, which is often the principal constraint most often cited by
entrepreneurs. Factors accounting for lack of progress in increasing financial access include economywide structural impediments to financial intermediation that limit the number of creditworthy clients
and/or increase the costs and risks of offering financial services. There is also a lack of competition in the
banking sector, high overhead costs and interest spreads, and high and nontransparent bank commissions
and fees. Other factors are the informal nature of the private sector and limited management, financial,
and technical skills at smaller firms. Small and medium-size enterprises also suffer from lack of business
advisory services. The local business services market is characterized by large firms supplying highquality and expensive accounting, auditing, information technology, and legal services to large
enterprises, with limited affordable services available to small and medium-size enterprises. Catalytic
interventions can help stimulate the demand and supply of business advisory services. Addressing the
skills deficit in the workforce requires investments in technical and vocational training so that graduates
have marketable skills. Small and medium-size enterprises would also benefit by greater linkages with
mega-projects and more streamlined registration procedures that would help businesses graduate from the
informal to the formal sector.

Diversifying Sources of Growth
30. Agriculture is arguably the most critical sector relative to a more inclusive growth strategy in
Mozambique. It is the country’s second largest sector in the economy, contributing 24 percent of GDP
and employing 78 percent of the workforce. While annual growth in the agricultural sector has averaged
about 7 percent since 2003 and has been an important contributor to overall economic growth, it has
mainly been driven by the expansion in labor and land that followed post-conflict resettlement of refugees
in rural areas. Although new investments have taken place in specific subsectors, largely in response to
existing domestic and export market opportunities, the sector remains relatively unproductive and consists
largely of subsistence farming in which 85 percent of rural households are engaged. The average size of
cultivated land per household is less than 1.5 hectares.22 And their traditional inputs — using outdated
seeds, plants, tools, and techniques — result in low yields relative to neighboring countries with similar
agro-ecological potential. Low adoption rates of productivity-enhancing agricultural technologies,
coupled with an inadequate provision of agricultural services; limited access to rural finance; and a land
law inefficiently enforced are major constraints to transforming subsistence smallholders into market-led
agricultural entrepreneurs. And despite recent investments in roads, the density of the road network is the
lowest in southern Africa, and linking investments in rural roads to agricultural production areas still
remains a challenge. Other key infrastructure such as power, telecommunications, and irrigation are also
underdeveloped. Total irrigated area is only about three percent of its potential. Moreover, the rural
population suffers from high rates of malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, which reduce productivity.
Smallholders, particularly in the Zambezi Valley, are also highly vulnerable to extreme climactic

conditions that alternate between frequent droughts and floods. The increase in rural poverty reported in
the 2008-09 household survey23 is largely attributable to such weather events.
31. More women (83 percent) participate in the active labor force than men (72 percent).24 Eightnine percent of women are occupied in the agriculture sector while only 5.5 percent work in commerce
and 3.3 percent in the service sector.25 Men’s occupational pattern varies more with 68 percent in the
agricultural sector, 10 percent in commerce, 8 percent in services and 6 percent in government. Women
are staying in the agricultural, informal sector, and low-paid occupations while men are moving to pursue
higher earnings in other sectors. Improving the productivity of women in agriculture would boost
economic growth and reduce poverty. However, a country study finds that women are less likely than
men to grow tradable crops because they concentrate on basic foods to feed their family; yet the study
also finds that women with education do move into commercial agriculture.26 This accentuates the
multiple advantages of enhancing the level of education among women in rural areas. Furthermore,
women in rural communities experience lower technology adoption rates than men.27 This gender gap
does not only have important implications for equity, social cohesion, and individual welfare, it also
creates important economic inefficiencies. The latest poverty and gender assessment concludes that
strategies are needed to specifically help women diversify crops and raise output to a commercial scale
without risking household food security, for example through extension services targeting women.
32. The constraints faced by smallholders also deter agribusiness investment to a large extent.
Agribusiness successes over the past 20 years remain limited. The product mix has barely changed since
colonial times; technological change has been slight; and few investments in agribusiness have taken
place with the exceptions of sugar plantations and cashew, maize, and tobacco processing. Growth in
agribusinesses is also constrained by procedures for accessing suitable land and water rights, high cost of
expanding infrastructure, inadequate logistics and complex bureaucratic procedures for effective supplychain management, and minimum wage for labor that often exceeds labor productivity. These constraints
could be overcome through a series of reforms, prioritized investment programs, and public-private
partnerships in creating the necessary support institutions and access to financial resources. In addition,
Mozambique offers agribusiness investors with tremendous natural assets: extensive undeveloped and
fertile farmland, abundance of water for irrigation, and diverse agro-ecological environments suitable for
growing a variety of products.28
33. Beyond agriculture, the Government has identified the fisheries sector as an important
contributor to growth and poverty alleviation. The sector contributes to food security, balance of
payment, public revenues, employment, and gender equity. Fisheries are the foundation of economic
growth in many rural and urban areas and often the resource of last resort for poor, marginalized, and
isolated communities. About 850,000 households get income from fisheries, and fishing is the primary

source of income for about 330,000 people. The number of artisanal fishers involved in marine fisheries
doubled from 2002 to 2007. Women make up almost half the labor force, mostly engaged in post-harvest
processing and marketing and shellfish cleaning. Nevertheless, the sector’s economic performance has
fallen below its former position as a leading contributor to the national economy and foreign exchange.
Weak terms of trade and economic inefficiencies have undermined this contribution: up to three-quarters
of the economic rent escaped from Mozambique through transfer pricing (estimated at US$16 million per
year for a US$20 million per year rent). At the same time, rent could have been almost doubled (US$35
million per year) under appropriate management of the exploitation. In addition, better domiciling of the
activities, including upstream and downstream value chain, could improve the sector’s direct and indirect
contribution to the GDP. Reforms can reverse the observed downward trend, and new sector policy
instruments should be designed to improve integration of the activities in the national economy. New
principles and practices of allocation of fishing rights, an improved taxation regime, and spatial planning
would also support the distribution of benefits among the economic agents and the regions.
34. Given Mozambique’s varied and relatively pristine environment and mild year-round
climate, together with its rich cultural heritage and proximity to South Africa, the tourism sector is
often seen as an excellent prospect for development. However, the sector has not performed to its
potential, and investments have been slow to mature. Only 18 percent of approved tourism investments
between 2005 and 2007 have actually materialized. As shown by experience elsewhere, tourism growth
depends on two major factors: the overall investment climate and the quality and accessibility of the
tourism product. In Mozambique, tourism is hobbled by complex land acquisition process; inadequate
transport infrastructure, particularly air transport to coastal areas; and high cost of sourcing consumer
goods from South Africa. The Government of Mozambique nonetheless has set a target of attracting 4
million tourists over the next few years, compared to about 1 million in 2006. Arrivals are projected to
increase at 7.8 percent annually over the next few years, reaching 30.5 million by 2020. Tourism is
already the third largest investment sector in the country. Conservation areas and targeted coastal districts
have particularly high prospects because nature-based and sustainable coastal tourism are expected to be
the largest growth area in the coming decades: 60 percent of South Africa’s 6 million tourists, for
example, now visit protected areas each year, producing revenues of US$2.5 billion. Tourism’s linkages
to transport, agriculture, food and beverage, retail, financial services, and construction sectors offer
compelling job creation and economic growth opportunities.

Infrastructure
35. There has been substantial improvement in the provision of public goods that could facilitate
sustained and inclusive growth. This is particularly the case in transport infrastructure, electricity, urban
and rural water, and telecommunications. Mozambique’s infrastructure is beginning to approach the level
of its neighbors; entrepreneurs are less worried about energy provision, for example, than they were in
2003.29 Overall improvements however mask significant urban-rural disparities; and compared to middleincome economies such as South Africa, inadequate infrastructure in Mozambique continues to represent
a significant obstacle to improved living standards and economic productivity.

Box 4. Regional Integration and the Potential of Mozambican Infrastructure
The two leading Regional Integration Arrangements (RIA) in Southern Africa – the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Economic Community (SADC) – are making good progress toward an envisioned
African Common Market. The recently-established Customs Union is expected to be fully operational in 2012 and many
member countries are already part of a free trade area (FTA). These moves should enhance the economic potential of a region
whose combined population of 160.5 million is about 17 percent of Africa’s total. The combined GDP is 42 percent and
landmass is 22 percent of the continent’s total.
Progress on trade and regional integration has nevertheless been slower than desired due to several factors: overlapping regional
arrangements and membership, political turmoil in some countries, political sensitivities between countries, weak productive
capacity, low value addition in the production chain, and unsupportive business environment. Inadequate infrastructure is
another major challenge. Poor transportation network and infrastructure, insufficient energy supply, and underdeveloped ICT all
contribute to the region’s poor trade performance.
Mozambique can play an important role in ameliorating infrastructure bottlenecks. The country enjoys a privileged and
strategic location as the natural exit to most of its landlocked neighbors, in particular Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. The
transport infrastructure of central Mozambique extends east to west, from the Port of Beira to Zimbabwe, and marginally to
Malawi and Zambia. The southern transport network links the Port of Maputo to the northeastern part of South Africa,
Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. These two ―transport clusters‖ are multimodal, mostly functional, connecting mining and
agricultural clusters inside Mozambique and in neighboring countries to exit ports. The quality of roads along these corridors is
relatively good and the railway system is mostly functional, albeit in needs for significant upgrade and rehabilitation.
The regional importance of Mozambique also extends to the power and ICT sectors. The country, already a net exporter of
electricity, still has untapped hydropower potential mainly in the Zambezi watershed. Plans to expand the generation and
transmission infrastructure, which involve Bank participation, is underway which will enhance the country’s role as a key
player in the regional power market, catering to the demand for clean energy in South Africa and other neighboring countries.
In ICT, domestic fiber-optic backbone extends to all provincial capitals in the country and the commissioning of two fiber-optic
submarine cables (the first of which was completed in 2009) will add significantly to Mozambique’s international Internet
capacity. The parallel fiber-optic infrastructure not only provides redundancy in access to an international gateway, but
implicitly creates competitive conditions between landing points.
Despite the potential that exists, Mozambique and its neighbors are far from having an efficient, seamless and cost-effective
trans-boundary network of infrastructure that could significantly facilitate regional economic integration. The road network
needs to be improved and extended, and it must connect the east-west transport corridors to one another. Rehabilitation,
upgrade, and maintenance of railways are needed to meet growing demand from increased cross-border trade and domestic coal
production. Mozambique also needs to improve the financial sustainability of the power sector and take advantage of the
opportunities that power trade offers to the country. The potential for ICT is hampered by the need to further develop the
Internet market. All these issues require large and sustained investments over decades, with the needed participation of the
private sector and nontraditional financiers. Weak institutional capacity similarly poses a sizeable challenge.

36. Of Mozambique’s network of 37,000 kilometers of roads, only about 6,000 kilometers are
paved. Road density per land area is low at 46 meters per square kilometer due to the large size of the
country, but quite average relative to the population at 423 meters per 1,000 people. Estimates suggest
that the network could provide potential access (measured as those living within 2 kilometers of any road)
to around 41 percent of the rural population. However, because of the poor condition of the network, the
share of the rural population with reliable, all-year access is much smaller (the Government’s
Performance Assessment Framework puts it at 11 percent). Poor road condition contributes to high
vehicle operating costs, high transport costs, and low traffic volumes, posing major constraints to
agricultural areas. Moreover, much of the transport infrastructure was designed to serve the colonial
economy, providing access to seaports for landlocked countries in southern Africa. This has had serious
implications, particularly for the agriculturally productive areas of the north and center, which historically
have been poorly integrated into the national markets. Through the Government’s Roads and Bridges
Management and Maintenance Program, there has been much progress in expanding links to agricultural
areas; securing access to ports; upgrading corridors to neighboring countries to encourage industrial
19

development; and improving the main north-south road to stimulate internal commerce and provide
access to markets, district capitals, employment opportunities, and educational and health facilities.
37. Over the past decade, the Government has invested substantially to accelerate access to and
improve quality of modern energy services. Mozambique is endowed with huge energy resources. The
Cahora Bassa dam is one of the largest hydropower installations in Africa, generating 2,075 Megawatts
(or 85 percent of the country’s current energy production capacity), with much of this power exported
regionally. The country’s potential hydropower generation is estimated at 13,000 Megawatts, with the
capacity to produce 65,000 Gigawatt-hours per year of energy. This untapped resource has attracted
significant foreign private sector interest in investing in several power mega-projects that could make
Mozambique one of the largest power producers in the African continent. Despite this potential,
Mozambique has — even with significant gains in recent years — one of the lowest electrification rates in
southern Africa, with approximately 15 percent of households having access to electricity, half of them
living in Maputo and its surrounding areas and most of the remainder in the provincial capitals and
municipal district seats. Most of these urban and peri-urban centers are connected to the main national
electrical grid.
38. Access to grid-based electrification in the rural areas is extremely low at two percent. Due to
low demographic densities and geographically dispersed loads, access will remain very low for the
foreseeable future. Increasing household access to grid-based electricity is a major focus of the
Government but requires significant concessional financing. In addition, the majority of Mozambicans
rely on biomass such as wood, charcoal, dung from animals or agricultural waste as their principal energy
sources, all of which have a number of detrimental effects on people’s health and the environment. Offgrid electrification schemes (such as solar photovoltaic systems) have and can continue to increase access
to modern energy services. But substantial and sustained investments are required, anchored by a longterm national electrification strategy and a medium-term spatial, least-cost rollout of grid-based and
complementary off-grid programs.
39. While teledensity has shot up in recent decades, access to broadband is still limited, and is
particularly expensive outside of Maputo. With the introduction of a second mobile operator in 2002,
tele-density shot up from 0.8 percent in 2000 to 8 percent in 2006 to 22 percent by 2009 and close to 30
percent in 2011. Access to Internet and broadband is still expensive, especially outside of Maputo. The
lack of competitively priced backbone access constitutes one of the most severe barriers for operators to
expand. A deficient telecommunication infrastructure is a barrier for accessing information, for doing
business, in particular outside of Maputo, and to achieve effective decentralization.
40. Low-level access and poor service delivery characterize water supply and sanitation in
Mozambique. Only 43 percent of the population has access to safe water and 19 percent to adequate
sanitation. The rural-urban disparities are acute; while 70 percent of urban residents have access to safe
water supply and 47 percent to adequate sanitation, the corresponding numbers for rural inhabitants are 30
percent and 6 percent, respectively. Poor and uneven access to safe drinking water and adequate
sanitation is responsible for regular outbreaks of cholera and diarrhea, a major cause of child illness and
death. While urban areas are better served, Mozambique is experiencing a trend seen in Sub-Saharan
Africa as a whole. Service provision has not kept pace with rapid urbanization and, as such, the share of
the urban population with access to water and sanitation actually declined during the 1990-2006 period.
20

41. This decline is particularly notable in the Greater Maputo area where safe water supply
ranks low among major urban areas. On average, water is supplied for about 9 hours per day
(compared to 14 hours in 2005) with some areas limited to about 5 hours. The long-term supply of water
to the Maputo area is of major concern given the city’s contribution to overall economic growth. It is
estimated that by 2012, the present source of water (the Umbeluzi River) will be fully utilized and will
still be able to serve about 73 percent of the population. In the meantime, the estimated demand for water
in the Greater Maputo area is expected to grow from about 206,000 cubic meters per day in 2012 to about
560,000 cubic meters per day in 2035. The rapidly increasing numbers of peri-urban residents (around
200,000 people per year) without access to adequate sanitation facilities and fecal sludge management
services is of particular concern from a public health perspective.

Climate Change and Natural Disaster
42. Mozambique ranks third among African countries most exposed to risks from extreme
weather events in the form of floods, cyclones, and droughts.30 Drought is the most frequent disaster,
occurring primarily in the southern and central regions with a frequency of 7 in 10 and 4 in 10 years,
respectively. There are areas in these regions classified as semi-arid and arid (Gaza, Inhambane, and
Maputo) where rain, even when above average, is inadequate and results in critical water shortages and
limited agriculture productivity. An estimated 35 percent of the population is now thought to be
chronically food insecure. Economic impacts of drought seem to be most significant in Zambezi Province,
where production losses could range between US$12 million to US$170 million in maize alone. Floods
in Mozambique occur most frequently in the southern and central regions, along river basins in low-lying
regions, and in areas with poor drainage systems. They are linked not only to heavy rainfall but also to
water drainage from rivers in upstream neighboring countries. Water from nine major river systems from
vast areas of southeastern Africa finds its way to the Indian Ocean across Mozambque. The flood in 2000
killed about 800 people and displaced 540,000. Most recently, in January of 2012, Tropical Storm Funso,
while never making landfall, directly affected 65,000 people whose homes were inundated and suffered
severe damage.
43. From January to March, Mozambique is subject annually to 3 or 4 cyclones, which travel up
the Mozambique Channel. More than 60 percent of the population of 22 million live in coastal areas and
is therefore highly vulnerable to seawater inundation, as are coastal agriculture and the fisheries sector.
Such inundation threatens coastal infrastructure such as roads and housing. In some areas of Beira, 30 to
40 meters of beach have been eroded in the past 15 to 20 years. Storm surges pose a huge threat to coastal
infrastructure as they can temporarily raise sea levels by as much as five meters. While many of the major
coastal cities of Mozambique have infrastructure in place to stem the effects of such extreme events,
many are in need of serious maintenance. In regional projections, climate change is expected to increase
the frequency and magnitude of weather events. As a result, droughts, floods, and cyclones are likely to
pose a large threat to the country’s economic growth.

Social Protection
44. Along with natural disasters and the projected impact of climate change, exogenous shocks
stemming from global economic events expose the extreme vulnerability of the majority of the
30

21

population falling near or below the national poverty line. According to a 2007 FAO assessment, 20
of the 128 districts in the country are ―highly prone to drought‖, 30 to flooding, and 7 to both. The poorer
households tend to spend a higher share of their budget on food and have fewer assets (wealth). Floods
and cyclones have the strongest impact on household expenditures, reducing them by about 32 percent.
Droughts are estimated to have an impact of approximately 17 percent. However, the impact on
households’ expenditure from idiosyncratic shocks is even higher. It is estimated that the death of a
breadwinner may cause a reduction in household’s expenditure by mover 50 percent, while illness would
reduce it in about 25 percent. Only a minor proportion of workers, usually the less poor (formal workers
and public servants) have access to any kind of insurance or any other social benefit. An equally low
proportion of households has access to financial and credit markets. Social assistance interventions
comprise few and in some cases fragmented social transfers as well as other welfare programs with
limited coverage and unclear targeting methods or eligibility criteria. Consequently, households usually
have to rely on informal coping mechanisms to address seasonal as well as unpredictable shocks, such as
reducing food consumption or selling assets. These strategies not only represent a further barrier for poor
households to overcome poverty and vulnerability but may inflict irreversible damage to human capital
formation (especially as a result of chronic malnutrition among infants, which is likely to affect learning
capacity as children and productivity as adults).
45. Since 2007, the Government has been taking measures to establish basic social protection.
The Social Protection Law (Law 4/2007) was issued in 2007, and the Government approved the Basic
Social Protection strategy in 2010. The Government has also made progress in defining clear institutional
responsibilities regarding social protection and social safety net strategy and programs. In this framework
and under the overall coordination of the Ministry of Women and Social Action (MMAS), the Productive
Social Action, a multi-sector strategy, will promote the socio-economic inclusion of vulnerable and foodinsecure population with the opportunities to work. At the core of the strategy is an intervention to
provide seasonal (temporary) but predictable sources of income to households affected by regular and
unexpected shocks mainly by participating in public works and complemented by other incomegeneration initiatives. The labor-intensive public works program will complement the current cash
transfer intervention (with targeted public service announcement to the elderly, chronically ill, and
disable) to provide a temporary source of income to those able to work during periods of food insecurity,
thus reaching all vulnerable households. A strategic combination of public works programs and cash
transfers may be adequate to gradually link vulnerable groups both to productive and income-generating
activities and to social services for human capital accumulation and thus contribute to economic growth
and poverty reduction. To ensure that the programs reach the poorest and most vulnerable, an accurate
targeting mechanism to select beneficiaries should be developed and tested.

Service Delivery
46. Rising demand for social services is not being met with a commensurate increase in supply.
Mozambique has made good progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However,
the progress could have been even greater if the supply to essential services could have kept up with the
increasing demand. For example, net enrollment in primary education more than doubled from 45 to 95
percent between 1998 and 2010. This massive increase has put enormous pressure on the system. Recent
data suggest quality is deteriorating and there is an acute shortage of spaces in secondary schools. In
health, the percentage of the population with access to a health unit within 45 minutes’ travel by foot rose
22

from 55 to 65 percent between 2002-3 and 2008-9. The increase in the numbers of schools and clinics is
constrained by the ability of government to train and hire all the teachers and health workers that are
required and provide adequate financing for school materials and drugs.
47. Inequities in access to basic social services persist. While access to social services has increased,
it has often been inequitable in terms of gender, income, or geography. Provincial disparities also exist,
where the northern and central provinces have lower access to health services, education, water,
sanitation, and social protection. These provincial disparities are reinforced by lower per capita budget
allocations. The proportion of school age population enrolled in secondary education varies from only 2
percent in Niassa to 12 percent in Maputo. Poorer families are also less likely to access services. For
example, antenatal care coverage varies between 58 percent and almost 100 percent in the lowest and
highest quintiles.

Governance and Public Sector Management
48. Another challenge for Mozambican society is weak governance structures, including
institutions and the rule of law. The Worldwide Governance Indicators for 2009 indicate improvements
since 2004 across 5 indicators, most prominently for political stability but also those measuring
government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. 31 However, on voice
and accountability, Mozambique’s percentile showed a modest slippage. Compared to country groupings,
Mozambique’s percentile ranking exceeds those of Sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries
across all 6 indicators. Nevertheless, there is plenty of room for improvement. With the exception of
political stability, all other indicators for Mozambique in the 2009 assessment fall below the 50th
percentile. Despite adoption of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy in 2006, perceived corruption has
increased. Transparency International (TI) Perception Index (scale of 10 to 0, ―very clean‖ to ―highly
corrupt‖) for Mozambique has been static at 2.8 from 2004 and 2007; slipped to 2.7 in 2008; down to 2.5
in 2009; the back to 2.7 in 2010, a score that did not change in 2011.32 And while there has been stepped
up efforts by the donor community to engage civil society organizations (CSOs) and to give voice and
increase participation, tangible results beyond the demonstration effects of donor projects have been slow
to materialize.
49. Civil society engagement in governance is recent in Mozambique. Accountability mechanisms
are generally thought to be weak.33 Voice and accountability are rather unfamiliar concepts in
Mozambique, and citizens know very little about rights and responsibilities.34 There is still a culture of
deference towards authorities, especially in rural areas, which restricts citizens’ active engagement. There
is general agreement that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and CSOs are typically characterized
as weak in capacity and organization. In addition, the existing legislation makes it cumbersome,
complex, and expensive to register an organization. For instance, a minimum of ten people is required to
start the registration process, and all signatories have to submit proof of no criminal record, which is

23

extremely difficult to obtain. Overall, CSOs are excluded from real decision-making processes and their
influence on development policies remains weak.
50. Mozambique has come a long way from its dire state of public financial management at the
end of the civil war. Three successive Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessments help trace the course of the remarkable improvements resulting from a strong emphasis on
the introduction of a new legal framework, coupled with the implementation of an integrated financial
management information system (e-Sistafe). The proportion of indicators scored B or above has gone
from 39 percent in 2004, to 54 percent in 2006 and 61 percent in 2009. This puts Mozambique in the top
league of PFM performers in Africa. However, this relatively ineffective spending despite good PEFA
scores is an apparent paradox. PEFA data shows that although Mozambique does well on formal,
centralized processes, such as following a structured budget process, maintaining aggregate fiscal
discipline, or producing financial statements on time, significant challenges remain in utilizing the new
rules and systems toward improving day-to-day practices at sector level. For instance, manually operated
processes coexist with electronic technology, in particular for expenditure commitment. Similarly,
although automated financial reporting capabilities and internal oversight entities exist throughout
government, there is little evidence that they are properly utilized to monitor spending for compliance,
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. These findings about the gap between the theoretical blueprint of
PFM reform at play, partial implementation of reforms, and the reality of daily practices are especially
acute when it comes to spending in sectors, provinces, and districts as opposed to central finance
agencies.
51. While progress was made in improving Mozambique's public procurement system,
challenges remain for enhancing its efficiency and transparency and strengthening the capacity of
public officials to implement the procurement legislation. The Government has demonstrated strong
commitment to improve the country's procurement system with its the adoption of the 2005 procurement
legislation and the creation of a new central procurement institution (UFSA) in 2006-2007, and a unit for
execution and management of acquisition (UGEA). These reforms were supported by a capacity-building
exercise program, and technicians were trained at the central, provincial, district, and local municipality
levels. Nonetheless, the 2008 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) identified areas for
improvement in the legal framework, capacity, and transparency. By publishing a revised Procurement
Decree in 2010 and by reinforcing UFSA and installing 821 UGEAs, the Government has contributed
significantly to the legal framework and institutional architecture; but little has been achieved on the
operation of the system and less on integrity. Although the capacity of public officials improved over the
years, limited detailed knowledge of the procurement legislation, meager financial resources, and
resistance to change required with adoption of new procurement practices undermines their ability to
fulfill their mandate.
52. Public sector reform shows limited results. The Government of Mozambique adopted the Global
Strategy for the Public Sector Reform (2001-2011) aimed at enabling the public sector to promote socioeconomic development and reduce poverty. It is in the process of developing the next strategy. Significant
progress had been made with the creation of an integrated database allowing strategic management of
human resources and establishment of an electronic payment management system (e-FOLHA) to improve
payroll management. The implementation of a new wage policy in 2009 and the approbation of a national
policy for HIV/AIDS and disabilities in the work place also show positive trends. Progress however
24

remains limited in other areas. There is a lack of clear reform priorities and little attention is paid to
sequencing reform. The absence of a communication strategy supporting the implementation of the
reform and the lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities of central and decentralized government
structures also undermines the implementation of the Public Sector Reform. Inter-governmental
coordination remains a significant challenge in Mozambique.
53. Decentralization is an explicit strategy of the Government to achieve many of the objectives
of its PARP for 2011-14. The broad aim is to bring the management of public services closer to the
people and to allow districts to act as ―polos de desenvolvimento‖ (poles of development). A selfstanding decentralization policy does not yet exist but the Law on Local Organs of the State (LOLE) in
2003 and its regulation in 2005, have provided the legal framework for decentralization. They provide the
basis for the structure of local governments, deconcentration of functions to the districts, legal
requirements regarding preparation of local level development plans, and establishment of mechanisms
for flow of funds to the local level. Progress, however, has been tempered by shortcomings to
implementation, including the level of resource transfers, strengthening financial management,
accountability, and service delivery. On the municipal side, the creation of new municipalities together
with the transfers of responsibilities is creating additional demands on service delivery. But small
budgets and weak institutions have made it difficult for municipalities to comply with their mandates. To
accelerate the process of decentralization, and specifically to make policy objectives more specific and
operational, the Government is preparing a long-awaited Decentralization Strategy to be approved by the
Council of Ministers. In the meantime, as the 2011 by-elections showed, the simple fact that there are
municipalities with a political life of their own, and that local elections can take an unexpected turn,
means that the decentralization process, limited though it may be, is contributing to political evolution
and change.

E. Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy
54. Against the backdrop of continued strong growth and a deceleration of poverty reduction,
the Government seeks to reorient its new poverty reduction strategy to make economic growth
more inclusive and broad-based. The Government’s third poverty reduction strategy (PARP) is the
operational plan for the Government’s Five-Year Program and sets out a broad and ambitious agenda of
reforms. In preparing the strategy, the Government held broad-based consultations with major
stakeholders and civil society. While reflecting some continuity from the past PARP, it acknowledges the
challenges of sustained and inclusive poverty reduction; the urban–rural disparities in human
development and service delivery; uneven development across regions; and the precarious situation of
women, children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. Its principal theme reflects the intensified
policy dialogue among the World Bank, other development partners, and the Government: combating
poverty requires transforming the structure of production and economic productivity and their linkages,
the centrality of rural development in undertaking such transformation, and strengthening the domestic
market while facilitating its integration into the national economy. The PARP seeks to return to its
impressive record of poverty reduction and establishes a target of cutting poverty incidence from the 55
percent reported in the 2008-09 household survey to 42 percent in 2014.35

35

Inquérito sobre Orçamento Familiar 2008/09 (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2010).

25

55. The strategic orientation of the PARP is clustered around three pillars that contribute to the
overall objective of inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. These are (a) increased
agricultural and fishery production and productivity, (b) job creation, and (c) human and social
development. The three main PARP pillars are complemented by two supporting themes (or cross-cutting
pillars) on fostering good governance and preserving macroeconomic stability. The PARP includes a
strategic matrix of key indicators that are the basis for monitoring progress. It is the intention that these
indicators will be monitored through existing national systems that comprise the annual economic and
social plan (PES), the annual monitoring of the PES (Balanço do PES), and the annual budget and budget
execution reports. A subset of the indicators will be used to jointly assess progress on General Budget
Support through the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF).
56. The Government designed the PARP as a dynamic and flexible document. In contrast to the
previous two PRSPs, the PARP allows the Government to adjust priorities and targets in light of changing
economic and social conditions and international developments, and in tandem with the implementation
of sectoral strategies, such as the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PEDSA) for 2010-19, the
forthcoming Financial Sector Development Strategy, and the successor to the 2008-2012 Strategy for the
Improvement of the Business Environment in Mozambique. The objectives and indicators would be
updated in the PES and reflected in the PAF, in agreement with budget support donors. The Bank
strongly welcomes this new dynamic nature of the document.

II. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
57. The new Country Partnership Strategy for FY12-15 will be implemented as Mozambique
confronts a critical juncture in its development. The country is faced with the daunting and immediate
task of maximizing the social and economic benefits of its natural resources; transitioning toward a more
inclusive growth strategy anchored to productive agriculture; accelerating efforts to achieve MDG targets;
putting in place policies, programs, and institutions to mitigate the myriad shocks that impact the country;
and reversing the perception of a stalled reform process that could lead to cuts in development assistance.
These constitute only part of a weighty development agenda whose implementation will be tested over the
next few years by political events and on-going global economic challenges.
58. The Government has expressed a strong desire for robust support and leadership by the
World Bank at this important juncture in the country’s history. The CPS for FY12-15 supports the
catalytic role the Bank is taking to: develop one of the region’s largest hydroelectric generation and
transmission projects in partnership with the private sector and donors; develop the burgeoning natural
resources sector in a sustainable, well-managed, and transparent way based on global good practice;
crowd-in financing, particularly from the private sector, to help rehabilitate or upgrade its railways, road,
and other infrastructure that are key to national and regional development; leverage private sector
investments in mega-projects to stimulate ancillary economic activity in growth corridors; strengthen the
links between improved governance and enhanced service delivery through innovative results-based
approaches; put in place a comprehensive and unprecedented social protection program to protect
vulnerable populations; provide technical leadership and a convening role on donor dialogue on
agriculture and climate change; and close the vast infrastructure gap. Leadership on the operational and
financing side will be underpinned by a renewed commitment to analytical and advisory activity (AAA).

59. The CPS for FY12-15 incorporates lessons learned from the past and is strongly aligned with
the country’s vision for the future. It is aligned with the priorities and embedded in the framework laid
out in the Africa Regional Strategy. Gender, social accountability, and nutrition – all critical to the
country’s vision of inclusive growth, will be mainstreamed throughout the portfolio (see Box 6 on gender
mainstreaming). The CPS will employ an integrated approach that stresses (a) partnerships with various
stakeholders; (b) stepped up demand-driven knowledge generation and advisory work; and (c) use of IDA
resources as a catalyst for leveraging financing by government and traditional and non-traditional
partners. These approaches will be undertaken in the context of greater selectivity; efforts to address
portfolio fragmentation and quality; cross-sectoral approaches to complex development challenges; and
continued efficiency gains in project preparation and implementation, greater decentralization, and results
orientation.

A. Lessons Learned from Previous CPS
60. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) undertook a Country Program Evaluation (CPE)
of the World Bank’s assistance to Mozambique in 2010.36 The CPE covered the period from FY01-08
although many of the general findings could also apply to the period of the previous CPS for FY08-11. Its
main findings included the following: (a) Bank support to agriculture did not have a significant impact on
the productivity of small-scale farmers in rural areas; (b) progress in Bank support to the SME sector was
slow owing to limited access to finance; and (c) the Bank’s program also fell short of intended results in
improving the quality of social services, countering the perception of corruption, strengthening the
judicial system, and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS. It also noted that the IFC portfolio was
dominated by investments in two foreign-owned, capital-intensive mega-projects (with IDA participation)
that contributed to growth through increased exports and helped enhance foreign investors’ perception of
the investment climate. However, the extent of their development impact has been limited due to weak
linkages with the local economy and limited employment generation.
61. The IEG evaluation made several key recommendations to the World Bank. The IEG
recommendations included: (a) help make credit more accessible to small and medium-size enterprises,
assist to improve business procedures and regulations, and ensure a firm basis for increased agricultural
productivity (helping Mozambique sustain high growth while reshaping its pattern to facilitate greater
employment creation and poverty reduction); (b) focus analytical work on infrastructure strategy,
agricultural productivity, education quality, and HIV/AIDS; and (c) support more efficient public
expenditures with emphasis on high-quality social services. The evaluation noted that while the Bank
advanced the harmonization and alignment agenda through joint efforts with other development partners
to provide budget support and while this arrangement helped to structure the dialogue and improved
predictability of resource transfers, it also limited the Bank’s flexibility and increased transaction costs.
62. These findings not only remain valid for the FY08-11 CPS period, they offer a degree of
caution for the Bank’s work over the next four years. The broad agenda that includes supporting small
and medium-size enterprises and in particular addressing bottlenecks to accessing finance and advisory
services will require long-term engagement with Government to see the type of structural, policy, and
institutional reforms needed to stimulate entrepreneurship and to provide incentives for small and
36

2010).

27

medium-size enterprises to move to the formal sector. Stimulating agricultural productivity is also a longterm proposition that will require greater Government coordination, commitment, and a clearer vision of
how productivity is to be achieved. Stimulating the growth of agribusiness, for example, would require a
broad set of policy and institutional reforms, including politically sensitive reforms involving land policy
and administration, as well as significant institutional building of key agencies. As Mozambique
undergoes such transformative processes, poverty levels remain high and a large segment of the
population remains highly vulnerable to shocks. A minimum level of social protection would address
vulnerability
63. The CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) reviewed CPS implementation during the FY08-11.
The CPSCR rated the CPS for FY08-11 as ―moderately satisfactory‖ in terms of both the program
performance and the Bank’s performance. The CPSCR found that the CPS was relevant, adequately
designed, responsive to client needs, integrated with the overall development partner harmonization
agenda, and that the anticipated portfolio was successfully delivered. The Bank’s performance was
characterized by a well-performing portfolio (on balance) and delivery of a larger than envisioned lending
program and high-quality and just-in-time knowledge products. However, there were some delays in
project delivery, leading to uneven achievement of outcomes. Moreover, the results matrix and the
strategy itself were not updated vis-à-vis a mid-term CPS progress report, rendering some outcomes
unobservable. The last semester of the CPS period also witnessed a deterioration of the portfolio with four
IDA projects in problem status.
64. The CPSCR highlights operational and portfolio issues that should be addressed in the CPS
for FY12-15. First and foremost, the failure to monitor CPS outcomes and to prepare a mid-term CPS
progress report to assess the need for strategic and operational changes in keeping with changing country
conditions was one of the most significant shortcomings of the past four years. The proposed CPS FY1215 should take a pro-active approach and have an annual stocktaking exercise on CPS milestones and
implement the necessary adaptations at mid-term together with a CPS progress report. The CPS
monitoring should be based on a more selective results matrix with a smaller number of outcomes to
avoid fragmentation of results. In addition, the results framework should carefully take into account the
level of results it can realistically achieve over the CPS period, given the timeframe, risks, and resources
available to support operations. It would also be worth trying to map investments per supported outcome
as this may place particular attention to high-value outcomes.
65. Going forward the CPS should lay out a more focused and planned AAA program related to
PRSC areas to inform the sector dialogue, as suggested by the IEG Country Program Evaluation.
Together with more Public Expenditure Surveys, analytical work will then have a better chance of
influencing reforms on which in turn investment operations can build. The Bank team should also take
seriously the suggestion by the IEG Country Program Evaluation to assume a stronger leadership role in
the budget support program, building on analytical work as a foundation. Besides other priority areas
determined by budget support areas and sector engagements, the analysis should focus on analyzing why
poverty rates are stagnating while Mozambique's economy sustains high levels of growth.
66. Lastly, echoing the CPE recommendations by IEG, the CPSCR notes that the heavy aid
architecture entails high transaction costs on the donors’ side. While there have been significant
improvements in recent years, there is scope for streamlining the donor aid architecture in Mozambique in
28

order for the donor community as well as Government to benefit from efficiency gains. This may need
high-level dialogue beyond the level of Heads of Cooperation.

B. CPS Consultations with Country Stakeholders
67. World Bank staff undertook consultations with civil society organizations, local and central
Government officials, and development partners. The consultations took place in four cities: Maputo,
Beira, Nampula, and Pemba. Approximately 300 individuals took part in the CSO consultations,
representing a wide range of organizations, from private sector groups to international NGOs that
undertake both advocacy and operational work. Stakeholders also included groups affiliated with political
parties, academic institutions, student associations, private sector representatives, union movements,
farmers associations, civic youth organizations, members of local community-based organizations, as well
as national and international NGOs. The main messages included:
 The World Bank should be more visible, known and understood at the local level. Civil society
has little knowledge of the Bank's activities in Mozambique and in their respective communities.
Task managers or members of the implementing units should use their travels to liaise more
often with civil society about their specific projects. These comments are being taken on board
as part of the preparation of the Bank’s communications strategy of engagement with
Mozambican society, including the press, civil society, and ordinary citizens to improve
awareness of the Bank’s support and development issues more generally.
 There was a universal call for the Bank to work more closely with civil society, beyond
consultations, and to partner with civil society operationally. Suggested areas of collaboration
included service delivery at the community level, project monitoring and evaluation, governance
and anti-corruption, and monitoring of project finances by implementing agencies. Whether
such a partnership develops, CSOs asked that these consultations do not end with the individual
workshops but rather should continue through follow-up communications. To this end, the midterm CPS progress report would be a good opportunity to have follow-up consultations to
inform participants of progress on CPS objectives.
 Many participants expressed the opinion that the Bank was committed to greater transparency
and openness - both in terms of itself as well as to the Government. Given the difficulties in
obtaining information from Government authorities on policies and decisions that affect their
lives, participants requested that the Bank play a more active role in facilitating access to
information about Government policies and programs. More broadly speaking, CSOs particularly those based in Maputo - called for the Bank to push for improved governance and
anti-corruption as a means to enhance development effectiveness.
68. Among local provincial, district, and municipal authorities, discussions focused largely on
local needs. Service delivery, particularly in health and education, was brought up consistently as a
challenge, given devolved responsibility and inadequate budgets. Inadequate infrastructure, particularly
in more rural areas, was also raised as a main concern. Discussion also revolved around possible Bank
support to local industries, such as tourism, fisheries, agriculture, and manufacturing. Echoing one of the
messages from CSO participants, local authorities asked that Bank teams take some time to make

29

―courtesy visits‖ to keep appropriate authorities abreast of Bank activities and to explore possibilities for
collaboration.
69. Directors of central ministries participated in a roundtable discussion about the Bank’s
program of active and planned lending and analytic work. The Bank team stressed the importance of
maintaining a well-performing portfolio and high disbursement ratios. While acknowledging that there
were elements within country systems that require sorting out, Government participants noted that Bank
procedures were also cumbersome and cause implementation delays. Government also pointed out that
there was scope to improve just-in-time analytic work to inform Government decision-making and to
underpin policy and institutional reforms, as well as strategies and programs. Lastly, Government
acknowledged the need for greater coordination across sector ministries as the Bank adopts a more multisectoral approach to its program.
70. The Bank held two consultations with development partners in Maputo. One consultation was
with the UN country team and included the heads of all UN agencies. The other included heads of
bilateral aid agencies providing budget support (G-19 members) as well as other non-budget support
donors, both traditional and emerging, including Japan and China. The consultations provided the Bank
an opportunity to lay out the overall thrust of the CPS and the proposed program of lending and analytic
work; to emphasis the need for stronger and broader partnerships, greater program selectivity, and multisectoriality; and to discuss in detail specific projects, such as the Growth Poles Development Project.
Development partners expressed support for the Bank’s plan to increase its program of analytic work (a
participant commented on the notable decline in Bank analytic work that used to underpin the PRSCs);
welcomed the Bank’s proposed engagement in ―new‖ areas, such as climate change, social protection, as
well as plans to deepen involvement in EITI and agriculture. A question on trade-offs was posed to the
Bank team in reference to the flat budget environment the Bank is operating in while pursuing a fairly
ambitious program covering myriad sectors. Other partners questioned whether the Bank was doing
enough to ―push the envelope‖ in areas such as water, agriculture, and governance. Aid coordination and
development effectiveness were also discussed, particularly in relation to the Bank’s participation in
sector working groups and budget support.

C. Country Partnership Strategy Objectives and Program
71. The CPS is aligned with both country and Bank strategies. The CPS FY12-15 takes as its
starting point the country’s own vision of its development goals and its strategy for achieving them. The
close collaboration among Government, the Bank, and development partners over the past two years has
led to considerable symmetry between the PARP and the proposed CPS, not only in terms of the main
theme of inclusive, pro-poor growth but also in its focus on priority policy and institutional areas that will
be key to achieving the Government’s vision. The CPS is consistent with the IDA policy framework’s
main themes of climate change, gender considerations, and regional integration and is also embedded
within the framework of the Africa Regional Strategy. Like the Africa Regional Strategy, the CPS has
three pillars. The first two are Competitiveness and Employment, and Vulnerability and Resilience. The
third, Governance and Public Sector Capacity, is considered a ―foundation‖ (see Figure 4).
72. Seventeen outcomes have been defined encompassing 30 outcome indicators. The set of
indicators primarily derive from the ongoing Bank programs and not from products and services in the
30

pipeline, given the need to measure tangible results in two years’ time in the CPS Progress Report. The
Progress Report, in turn, will include an updated Results Matrix taking into account indicators from new
projects entering the pipeline and revised targets through the end of the CPS period. An overview of the
major objectives, outcomes, and programs defined for each pillar is included below. The CPS Results
Framework Matrix is found in Annex 1.

(a) Pillar I. Competitiveness and Employment
73. Pillar I is expected to provide the principal support to the overarching CPS goal of broadbased, inclusive, and pro-poor growth. There are eight objectives that underpin this goal: (a) improved
regulatory environment; (b) improved management of development process through spatial planning; (c)
increased crop yields and overall productivity; (d) increased employment and growth in the tourism
sector; (e) improved provision and management of road infrastructure; (f) improved provision of water
and sanitation service; (g) improved access to electricity; (h) improved access to affordable
telecommunications; and (i) better educated, skilled, and healthier workforce. Achievement of these
objectives entails a mix of investments, policy, and institutional reforms; capacity building; analytic
work; and the ability to convene various stakeholders, including local communities and the private sector
(Table 3). The proposed program of new products and services supporting Pillar I is detailed in Table 4.
74.
The on-going PRSC series has been the primary means of supporting reform. Over the next
CPS period, FY12-15, the annual PRSCs will more strongly support reforms to improve the business
environment, including simplifying administrative procedures and eliminating unnecessary regulations
(e.g., import and export clearances); strengthening the financial sector; and maximizing the benefits from
megaprojects, concessions, and public–private partnerships. Over the medium term, there is scope to
support more fully the range of sectors in the PAF matrix for budget support, including addressing
constraints to agricultural productivity, infrastructure provision and management, exploitable renewable
and non-renewable resources, fisheries, and tourism. The Bank is currently in discussion with

31

Government and development partners over the scope of the reform agenda to be supported by the next
PRSC series.

75. The Bank is working closely with IFC to provide the needed analytic and advisory support to
improve the country’s business and investment climate. The Competitiveness and Private Sector
Development Project (FY09) aims to enhance the overall business environment by improving the SME
competitiveness through improved access to business development services, broader tourism-led growth
in Inhambane, and improved horticulture skills through a new training center in Nampula. It also invests
in standards and quality-related services while strengthening the accounting profession. The IFC’s
Mozambique Investment Climate Project (FY12) will support and help implement key elements of the
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development Project, improving the country's investment climate
through regulatory simplification of business registration and licensing procedures. The Financial Sector
TA Project (FY06) is part of an overall multi-donor framework to improve the soundness of the banking
sector and public debt management through key policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms that aim to
support the development of a financial sector capable of delivering more appropriate, affordable, and
sustainable services needed by firms, both large and small and medium-size enterprises. The Bank is
looking at options to continue support to the financial sector, including a Financial Sector Access project
that would focus on promoting access to financial services for households and businesses while
consolidating the recent achievements in terms of financial sector stability and soundness. The ongoing
work on the Financial Sector Development Strategy will result in more immediate targeted advice,
technical assistance, and enhanced policy dialogue for financial sector development.
76. Supporting high growth SMEs is a key focus of IFC’s strategy in Mozambique. Until 2009,
IFC implemented an SME initiative that provides financing and technical assistance and aims to build the
Mozambican economy's ―missing middle‖ by targeting local firms with long-term funding, hands-on
partnership, and support in key business functions, including marketing, management, human resources,
and information technology. This program is now being handed over to a fund manager for expansion.
IFC will expand its established SME capacity building programs, Business Edge and the SME toolkit,
both implemented through partnerships with Mozambican institutions. The third phase of IFC’s
successful supplier linkages program with large firms, Mozlink, will transfer operational responsibility to
the CPI. IFC has helped increase access to finance by supporting a bank in Mozambique through
32

subordinated debt and credit line products plus advisory service aimed at helping the bank to grow and
adequately manage SMEs. Those projects assist the Bank in extending financing to the SMEs, including
women entrepreneurs (Gender Finance) as well as growing its retail business in line with IFC’s strategy.
IFC will replicate this approach with other banks, including supporting the establishment of new
greenfield banks to spur competition in the sector, and potentially local currency lending.
77. IFC support for large-scale projects
will help ensure their broad-based
development impact. IFC has supported three
large-scale industrial, natural resource, and
infrastructure projects to date: Mozal, the
Sasol gas pipeline, and the Moatize coal mine
and related infrastructure, the latter two as
integrated World Bank Group efforts. In the
future, IFC will seek to support those largescale natural resource and infrastructure
projects where IFC involvement can help
ensure economic and social sustainability, and
broad-based development impact. Potential
involvement currently ranges from projects in
cement, infrastructure, and energy, including
the extension of the Sasol pipeline project to
Maputo for electricity production and industrial
use.

Sustainable Irrigation Development Project (FY11) addresses infrastructure constraints to productivity by
financing sustainable irrigation schemes in central Mozambique as well as tertiary roads segments, and
energy supply to those schemes. To enhance sustainability of irrigation schemes and improve access to
markets by smallholder farmers, it also strengthens institutional capacity and participatory irrigation
management, and improves access to finance as a way of supporting the development of value chains.
33

The PROIRRI Project will directly link with the Spatial Development TA Project (FY11) and the Growth
Poles / Corridors Project (FY13) that identify the Zambezi Corridor as one of the core geographic areas
for agriculture-based economic development. The regional Agriculture Productivity Project for Southern
Africa (FY13) looks to strengthen and scale up regional cooperation in the generation of research,
technology, training, and dissemination programs for priority commodities and induce the required
transformation in the national research and extension system. To help ensure a healthy and skilled
agricultural workforce, the Bank’s portfolio of health and education projects will continue to increase the
numbers of rural schools and health facilities.
Box 5. Mainstreaming Gender in the Bank Portfolio
The Bank recently undertook an assessment of how it is addressing gender issues in Mozambique. The review involved 25
projects, including 14 on-going IDA operations, 6 pipeline projects, and 5 ESW to be delivered in the beginning of the CPS
period (FY12-15). For a project to be considered as having a ―gender-responsive design‖, the project appraisal document
(PAD) should demonstrate that (a) there has been a gender analysis or a gender-sensitive social assessment during project
preparation, and/or relevant diagnosis and recommendations from a Country Gender Assessment (made by the Bank or
partners) are adopted in the PAD, and/or consultations that address male and female beneficiaries separately informed the PAD;
and (b) the results of that analysis have informed project design, as indicated by at least one of the following: (i) specific project
policy or activity that seeks to promote gender equality through either gender-targeted or universal policy/project intervention;
or (ii) gender-specific target or indicator in the Results Framework.
The review found that 64 percent of the projects in the current portfolio have a gender-responsive design. This means that a
majority of projects in the portfolio have addressed gender issues in the preparation of the project and have identified specific
project policies or activities that seek to promote gender equality through either project intervention and/or gender specific
indicators in the binding documents for the projects. The review cautiously estimates that 75 percent of the country’s lending
portfolio will be gender mainstreamed by the end of the CPS period in FY15. This estimate excludes all IDA projects, which
are planned to end before FY15, and potential future projects not included in this review.
The country program could benefit by showing how Bank assistance addresses gender issues. Only 50 percent of the ongoing
and pipeline projects in the portfolio have a gender-informed results framework (in the ongoing project portfolio alone the level
is 43 percent). This means that while the majority of projects in the portfolio draw on gender-related diagnostic work, and these
are translated into specific project policy or actions, only half of the portfolio can generate measurable results related to gender.
That said, the review finds that 70 percent of the projects in the pipeline are expected to generate gender impact and results data,
which means that the project portfolio holds the potential to improve its reporting on gender targets.

79. Further support to the agriculture sector will include a programmatic Agriculture DPO
(FY13-15). Based on the analytical evidence from AAA and other sector work under the previous CPS,
the Agriculture DPO will address policy and institutional constraints to the implementation of the
country's 2010-2019 Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PEDSA) and the country’s
commitments to the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). The
Agriculture DPO will align closely with the Economic Governance Project (FY13) activities in
agriculture and is expected to contribute to outputs in the areas of: enhancing agriculture productivity
through technology adoption, improving land access and land administration, improving access to rural
finances, enhancing market access through rural roads improvements and supporting the decentralization
of the agriculture administration.
80. IFC and MIGA also support increased agricultural productivity through development of
sustainable commercial agriculture/agribusiness. Two MIGA guarantees were issued for a sugar
plantation project involving the rehabilitation of Mozambique’s largest sugar estate, which employs 8,000
people and injects US$7 million in annual salaries and wages into the local economy, and contributes an
estimated US$33 million annually to the Mozambican economy through import substitution and export
earnings. MIGA also issued a guarantee for a project to develop land for rice production. IFC has
34

supported the expansion of domestic grain processing, and currently is developing a pipeline of
agriculture and agribusiness projects.
81. Beyond agriculture, the Bank looks to support the tourism (particularly related to wildlife
recovery and conservation) and fisheries sectors, both priorities of the Government and with
untapped potential for growth. The on-going Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism
Development Project (FY06) has contributed to the growth of tourism in Mozambique by building the
country’s capacity to manage natural tourism assets. The project has two major dimensions: (a)
supporting reforms to the regulatory framework and (b) support to protected area management and
sustainability. On the latter, the project has provided a model for shared growth by establishing
community–private joint ventures whereby the community becomes a more prominent player in the
development of tourism rather than the classic model of tourism investment. It is expected that five
protected areas will have achieved minimal capacity to sustain wildlife recovery and gradually build their
sustainability through tourism revenues. The follow-on project under preparation, Transfrontier
Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project II (FY14) looks to scale up the partnership with
local communities, improve management capacity, and invest in infrastructure that will allow greater
visitor access within the protected areas. Reductions in malaria transmission, as supported through the
Health Service Delivery Project (FY09), are also likely to contribute to the growth of tourism. The IFC
Tourism Anchor Investment Program is implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and
local communities, facilitating private investment in tourism and helping implement regulatory reforms
aimed at improving the investment climate in the sector. The program has developed approaches to
concessioning tourism development sites, including those in sensitive areas, and brought two initial
projects to closure in Zambezia Province and in the Maputo Special Reserve.
82. Fisheries are the foundation of economic growth in many rural and urban areas, and often
the resource of last resort for poor, marginalized, and isolated communities. The on-going
Community-based Coastal Resources Management and Sustainable Livelihoods Grant (FY09) targets the
reduction of pressure on over-exploited marine and coastal resources through community awareness and
promotion of sustainable exploitation methods and innovative alternative activities. It is expected that the
project will provide a model for mitigating impact on coastal population brought on by future access
restrictions to fishery grounds due to the expansion of coastal protected areas or need to maintain the
health of fish resources. In parallel the Regional South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (FY08)
supports the improvement of knowledge of fisheries resources, capacity building in research, creation of a
regional management structure, and biodiversity mainstreaming in fisheries management. To enhance the
sector’s potential, the Fisheries and Coastal Livelihood Project (FY14) aims to increase in a sustainable
way the overall benefits generated by the exploitation of marine and coastal fisheries resources and the
proportion of those benefits captured by Mozambique, and to insure a fairer distribution of the benefits
both spatially and among economic agents (households, entrepreneurs, the state). The project will focus
on (a) economic governance; (b) private sector development; (c) human and institutional capacity
strengthening; and (d) global public goods management and regional fisheries collaboration.
83. Reflecting the division of labor agreed to with development partners, the Bank will continue
to focus on water supply and sanitation in urban areas though may respond to opportunities for
support to small rural towns. The Water Sector and Institutional Support Project (WASIS) (FY08) has
significantly increased water service coverage in the four major cities of Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and
35

Pemba and helped establish an institutional and regulatory framework for smaller cities and towns. With
additional financing (FY11), the project has expanded the scope to nine other provincial capital and
tertiary cities. The planned Greater Maputo Water Supply Project (FY14) will provide similar investment
and regulatory and institutional support to Maputo, which has seen its water supply services deteriorate,
given the pressures of increased urbanization and spatial expansion. The future project is closely linked to
and will follow the Water Resources Development Project (FY12), which will strengthen the management
of national water resources and increase the yield from the Corumana Dam to augment water supply for
the greater Maputo metropolitan area through 2020 and provide water to low-income, peri-urban areas not
currently served. Institutional and investment support to Maputo in the area of solid waste management
will continue through the Maputo Municipal Development Program II (FY11). Looking forward, the
Bank is in discussions with AusAID on further collaboration in supporting peri-urban sanitation in
Maputo and other cities, and water supply improvements in secondary urban centers.
84. The Bank will continue its support to improve the roads network to promote equitable access
and broad-based growth. The CPS will encourage activities that clearly support growth sectors, such as
agriculture feeder roads and roads that can link tourism sites to the markets. The Roads and Bridges
Management and Maintenance Program II (FY08) along with the associated additional financing (FY11)
looks to bridge the infrastructure gap in Mozambique, particularly for rural residents, through investments
to repair and maintain sections of the main north-south highway. The next phase of the project, to be
supported by Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program III (FY13) pending agreement
with authorities, will complete the program of rehabilitating the entire length of the north-south highway,
along with feeder roads to agricultural areas. The next phase of the Transfrontier Conservation Area and
Tourism Project (FY14) will improve road access within protected areas to bolster conservation and
tourism efforts. The Maputo Municipal Development Program II (FY11) supports rehabilitation of major
municipal arteries, primary and secondary roads, as well as unpaved peri-urban roads in the greater
Maputo municipal area. Both programs support institutional capacity and strategic planning to encourage
sustainable management of the roads infrastructure.
85. Beyond the on-going and proposed projects noted above, the Bank is in early discussions with
Government to look at ways to take a catalytic role in addressing infrastructure needs, especially
those with regional scope and implications. This includes a long-term strategic approach that would
help Government prioritize infrastructure investments, a strategy to manage and finance the rehabilitation
and operation of the railway sector, and key power transmission investments as a way to unlock the
country’s vast water resources and hydropower potential. The Spatial Development Planning TA Project
(FY11) promises to provide a long-term roadmap for the best use of resources for infrastructure
development. The Bank looks to take on a convening role in crowding in financing from development
partners and the private sector, leveraging limited IDA as well as exploring opportunities for IBRD
enclave financing and partial risk guarantees.
86. The Bank will continue its support to improve access to affordable telecommunications over
the course of the CPS for FY12-15. Through the Mozambique e-Government and Communications
Infrastructure Project (MEGCIP) (FY09) the Bank will continue support that contributes to lower prices
for international capacity and extends the geographic reach of broadband networks. Affordable access to
telecommunication services and to Internet services in particular is essential for improved access to
information, for doing business, and to promote effective decentralization of services to the provinces.
36

Through MEGCIP, and as the recently attributed third mobile licensee starts operations, competition and
affordability are expected to improve. The new entrant plans to build an extensive backbone network that
would compete with Telecomunicações de Moçambique (TDM) network. Growing demand through
additional use and development of applications, coupled with an appropriate regulatory framework, will
also help the viability of the networks and eventuality of lower prices. As the infrastructure becomes
available, government can deliver in a decentralized manner a wide range of applications in several
sectors (e.g., education, health, public administration, etc). Development of services and e-Government
applications as well as the underlying regulatory and physical framework to make it possible will
contribute to improved efficiency and transparency in public service delivery.
87. Improving access to and management of electricity and energy services will continue over the
course of the CPS for FY12-15. The US$80 million Energy Development and Access Project (FY10)
aims to reinforce the primary electricity network and extend the medium- and low-voltage grid in periurban areas, with a target of connecting an additional 25,000 households, as well as health facilities and
schools. It also seeks to accelerate access to off-grid electricity and modern energy services in
underserved rural areas through renewable energy resources and technologies, primarily through solar
photovoltaic systems. Separately, the planned Regional Transmission Development Program (FY13)
supports an estimated US$2.5 billion transmission expansion program co-financed commercially and by
other development partners. Its main objective is to support the development of a high-voltage
transmission system in Mozambique by linking the central grid that extends from Tete Province to the
southern grid in Maputo Province, and ultimately connecting to the South African Power Pool (SAPP) via
Kwazulu-Natal. The key objectives for the program are to increase the provision of affordable energy
services and efficiency to urban, peri-urban, and rural areas in Mozambique by evacuating power
southwards from new generation capacity in Tete province; support regional economic development by
supplying bulk power into the SAPP system; and support regional environmental sustainability by
replacing thermal power generation based on coal with renewable hydropower. IFC and MIGA, together
with IDA, have continued to support the oil and gas sectors through the Sasol Pipeline, a project
consisting of an 865 kilometers of gas pipeline from the central processing facility in Mozambique to
South Africa.
88. Beyond expanded infrastructure and improved business environment, Mozambique’s
competitiveness depends on a better-educated and appropriately skilled workforce. The Bank’s
education portfolio contains significant depth and breadth, supporting efforts to better prepare the
country’s workforce to contribute to sustained economic growth. The Education Sector Support Project
(FY11) aims to improve access to and quality of primary and secondary education through teacher
training, curriculum reform, distribution of school books, and supporting institution building to better
manage the sector. The planned additional financing (FY12) will expand the scope of the project to
include early childhood education while the additional financing to the Health Service Delivery Project
(FY09) will include a nutrition component to address chronic malnutrition, thus enhancing learning
ability and ultimate capacity of the population. The Higher Education, Science and Technology Project
(FY10) seeks to increase the number and raise the quality of graduates at the undergraduate and graduate
levels, and strengthen the national research capacities to produce research outputs of relevance to the
country’s strategic economic sectors. The Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
Project (FY06) and associated additional financing (FY12) looks to improve the quality and
responsiveness of the TVET system to labor market needs by providing training that is delivered in a
37

sustainable, integrated, effective, and equitable manner. Other on-going operations also have activities
that aim to enhance skills development.
89. Bank support to the health sector will also contribute to a healthier and more productive
workforce. The Health Commodity Security Project (FY11) aims to improve the availability of selected
and drugs and supplies including ARVs to treat HIV/AIDS and ACTs to treat malaria, both diseases
which take a heavy toll on the productivity of the workforce. The Health Service Delivery Project (FY09)
also finances activities to reduce the burden of malnutrition in addition to HIV/AIDS and malaria. The
Health Care Financing AAA (FY13) will help provide options to improve productivity and sustainability
of health services for the next ten years.
90. The Government of Mozambique realizes the potential of its many natural endowments and
its considerable development potential, as well as the need for proper planning and management.
With help from the Bank through the Spatial Development Planning TA Project (FY11), the Government
hopes to improve its national development planning with the introduction, institutionalization, and
mainstreaming of multi-sector spatial development planning methodologies and practices. The planned
Growth Poles Project (FY13) will build on this approach by supporting a critical mass of reforms,
productive infrastructure investments, skills development, and other value-added activities around large
anchor projects, normally mineral-based, that promote trade and investment-led growth and that are
located along under-developed or developing corridors with high potential to link anchor projects to the
local economy through densification (e.g., provision of feeder infrastructure to support smallholder
agriculture producers) and deepening (e.g., forging backward and forward linkages with local
enterprises).
91. The size of recent discoveries of gas deposits presents a potential “game changer” for
Mozambique’s development. The country has an historic opportunity to develop its domestic gas market
in addition to export schemes and subsequently create value from its natural resources beyond revenues
from export. The proposed Gas Master Plan, to be developed by the Government with support from the
Bank, aims to identify policy options to maximize the monetary, social and environmental value of
natural gas to Mozambique. Value will arise from domestic access to secure and affordable energy,
employment generation, reduction of fuel imports, economic diversification, community benefit sharing,
sustainable development through corporate social and environmental responsibility mechanisms/models –
all of which will be fundamental to inclusive growth. A significant challenge for the Government will be
to develop institutional capacity: in this regard, the Bank is preparing a Mining and Gas Technical
Assistance Project (FY13) to address identified policy and capacity gaps. The proposed project will
support reforms, initiatives, and capacity building to enhance the efficiency and accountability of
institutions involved in the management and planning of the mining and hydrocarbon sectors.

(b) Pillar II. Vulnerability and Resilience
92. In recent years, Mozambique has been buffeted by various shocks that have impacted the
pace and level of its growth, poverty reduction, and social cohesion. As such, Pillar II is an integral
part of the overall CPS goal of achieving inclusive and pro-poor growth. The deadly riots in 2008 and
September 2010, sparked by rising food and fuel prices, underlined the extreme vulnerability of most
Mozambicans to even the slightest rise in the cost of living — whether through a reduction in subsidies or
to the Mozambican Metical depreciation against the South African Rand. The spike in the global price of
38

food in 2007 had a significant impact on household consumption, which is estimated to have decreased by
more than seven percent.37 This is expected to have had a considerable impact on food insecurity for more
than half of the population given the high proportion of household income consumed in food (more than
65 percent in rural areas).38 Furthermore in 2009-10, the climatic phenomena El Niño produced a drought
similar to those in 2002-03 and 2004-05, which affected food production and food access.39 The seasonal
and unpredictable shocks suggest the need for permanent effective measures to mitigate future shocks and
to address the high degree of vulnerability among a significant portion of the country’s population.
93. The proposed program supported by Pillar II will address vulnerability in its various forms.
Pillar II entails three main objectives: (a) effectively respond to macroeconomic and idiosyncratic shocks;
(b) improve resilience to natural disasters and the impacts of climate change; and (c) strengthen social
safety net for the most vulnerable people (Table 5). The objectives of Pillar II will be supported by ongoing and new projects and analytic work, including those listed in Table 6.
94. Macroeconomic shocks include those stemming from terms of trade. Mozambique (particularly
urban inhabitants) is highly dependent on imported food from South Africa. In the 12 months preceding
the riots, the Metical depreciated one-third against the US dollar and two-fifths against the South African
Rand, exacerbating inflation triggered by rising food and fuel prices. Mozambique has established a
strong track record of maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework; and the World Bank, in close
partnership with IMF, continues to monitor and advise on policy responses against this and other types of
macroeconomic shocks. The PRSC series will continue to help fund the budget and maintain stability in
the real economy. Past actions have helped to improve revenue mobilization and public expenditure
management. More frequent country economic updates will also help ensure the Bank’s ability to
participate in the dialogue on macroeconomic management.
Table 5. Objectives and Expected Outcomes of Pillar II: Vulnerability and Resilience
Objectives
Effective response to idiosyncratic shocks
Mitigate the impacts of climate change and extreme
weather events
Reduce vulnerability to exogenous and endogenous
shocks

General Outcomes
 Improved health services for the vulnerable
 Adaptation to climate change and reduced risk of natural
disasters
 Strengthened social protection

95. There are multiple idiosyncratic shocks in the Mozambican context. Food insecurity is at a
very high level. Almost half of all children under-five are malnourished — a rate that has remained
virtually unchanged since 2003 — and chronic under-nutrition accounts for at least one-third of child
deaths. Malaria also poses a major public health problem, accounting for a large proportion of deaths
among children under-five. It is also a contributing factor to at least 30 percent of maternal deaths. The
incidence of tuberculosis (TB), at 431 per 100,000 is above the average incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Sixty-six percent of all diagnosed TB cases are co-infected with HIV, another significant health
challenge. Fifteen percent of people between the ages of 15 and 49 are living with HIV/AIDS, the eighth

highest prevalence rate in the world and almost twice the Sub-Saharan average of 7.2 percent. In 2005,
there were 123,000 AIDS-related deaths, and an estimated 1.6 million orphans.
96. The CPS will help the Government address these health-related crises. The Bank is working
with government and other partners to address key health system constraints. This includes policy
dialogue on human resources, health financing and the supply chain. This is combined with focused
project support. The Health Service Delivery Project (FY09) seeks to reduce maternal and child mortality,
the burden of malaria and tuberculosis, and the inequity in service provision in three Northern provinces.
The project supports rehabilitating and constructing health facilities, strengthening of the Government’s
malaria control management program, and capacity building. Additional financing under preparation for
FY13 will add a nutrition component, which will support interventions, such as Vitamin A distribution,
salt iodization and food fortification. Community-based nutrition activities will also be supported,
including the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, education on safe water, hygiene, and sanitation. The
ESW on health care financing will provide options for reducing the burden of poor health on the poor and
limiting catastrophic expenditures that push people into poverty. The Health Commodity Security Project
(FY11) seeks to improve the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies for people living with
HIV/AIDS, women seeking family planning and prenatal care, those needing vaccination against measles,
and people living in malaria prone areas (i.e., those requiring insecticide-treated mosquito nets). Health
has also been selected as a pilot for a new cross-sector program being developed to improve service
delivery performance by strengthening economic governance and accountability.
97. As noted earlier, Mozambique ranks third
among the African countries most exposed to risks
from multiple weather-related hazards. Major floods,
cyclones, and droughts have a significant impact on the
country's economy. As much as 58 percent of the
population and more than 37 percent of GDP are at risk
from two or more hazards. Each major shock can reduce
GDP growth on average by 5.6 percent. Observed trends
and future scenarios suggest climate change will
increase the extremity of weather patterns.

development policy operations (DPO) is planned during
the CPS period. The objective of the proposed operations will be to support progress in achieving policy
reforms necessary for mainstreaming climate change throughout the Government’s policymaking process
and to ensure a coordinated approach that addresses the many parallel strategies and planning processes at
different levels of government. Outputs would likely include a national climate change strategy;
development of a national institutional framework; and sectoral strategies and action plans in selected
sectors such as water, energy, forestry, social protection and health. Possible outcomes could include

40

progress in achieving lower carbon-intensity development and helping to ensure sustainable use and
preservation of the country’s vast tracts of forests for carbon sequestration.
99. The DPL-supported measures are intended to complement the portfolio of investment
projects co-financed by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, one of the newly established
Climate Investment Funds. The already mentioned National Water Resources Development Project
(FY12) seeks to address water scarcity through enhanced water resources planning and capacity of the
regional water authorities in the country’s river basins, including the Zambezi. It also aims to develop and
implement mechanisms to facilitate comprehensive water allocation, licensing, revenue, and compliance
with monitoring measures, in addition to rehabilitating the hydrometric network in the Zambezi Valley.
The third phase of the Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Project, which is under
discussion for FY13, will pilot appropriate and cost-effective engineering and adaptive maintenance
approaches on 1,000 kilometers of rural roads in the Zambezi Valley and develop an innovative rapid
response mechanism to road ruptures and bridge washouts. Another investment project, the Cities and
Climate Change Project (FY12) looks to improve municipal management and sustainable financing
approaches to enhance climate resilience in Maputo, Beira, Nacala, and Pemba, the coastal urban areas
that account for a significant share of the country’s GDP. In Beira, for example, heavy rainfall and higher
sea tides have already destroyed parts of the existing coastal protection infrastructure, leaving the interior
parts of the city vulnerable to flooding. Beira is also prone to cholera outbreaks, which are aggravated
during flood-related events. The project will support the city’s adaptation deficit in infrastructure
investments by improving drainage, coastal protection, and strengthening the municipal sanitation agency.
The on-going Health Services Delivery Project (FY09) can also integrate climate resilience measures in
Nampula, which is in one of the three provinces targeted by the project. More recently, Mozambique has
prepared a Disaster Risk Management Plan (FY11) aimed at building policy, strategies, and institutions;
identifying, assessing, and monitoring risks; and reducing underlying risk factors. The implementation of
the plan is being supported by the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR).
100. Two IFC Programs will support climate resilience in the private sector. IFC will implement
the private sector components of the PPCR under the Building Africa’s Resilience to Climate Change
(BAREC), a pre-pipeline advisory services program. The program will channel $10 million in PPCR
funding to catalyze private sector investments that result in climate resilience across all economic sectors,
with a focus on agriculture and forestry. At least one component will be implemented through
commercial banks to target small-scale projects. The IFC Mozambique Forestry program will provide
advisory services to develop sustainable private forestry investments, with a focus on maintaining and/or
expanding forest cover while generating economic returns. The program will focus on expanding
productive livelihoods for communities adjacent to productive forests, as well as taking advantage of
potential carbon offsets or other means of monetizing the forest’s carbon sequestration contribution.
101. The high degree of vulnerability to macroeconomic and idiosyncratic shocks, as well as
natural disasters, underlines the need for a comprehensive social protection system. Despite still low
coverage, Mozambique has developed some social safety-net programs. Social insurance only covers
seven percent of households, comprising public servants and other formal workers. Other social
assistance programs, including cash transfers to the elderly, disabled, and chronically ill, and in-kind
transfers for indigent populations, have limited coverage and low-budget allocation. Within this context,
the Bank is supporting implementation of the Government’s Productive Social Action Strategy through a
41

pilot project of labor-intensive public works to provide temporary income generation. The Bank’s 2008
Poverty Assessment shows that a labor-intensive public works program is an adequate short-term measure
to address immediate needs of highly vulnerable households. The Developing the Building Blocks for
Effective Crisis Response: Piloting a Public Works Program (FY11), funded by the Rapid Social
Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund, is expected to improve the design and implement the first phase of a
public works program; concurrently, the program supports developing tools, methods, and processes to
reach the poorest more efficiently; formulating and implementing appropriate interventions; and
monitoring safety net programs to inform decision-making. To complement the current social safety-net
assessment, discussions with authorities are considering the additional analysis needed to support
development and testing of targeting mechanisms. The pilot project, underpinned by on-going and
planned analytic work on targeting systems, will act as an entry point to a much more comprehensive
engagement by the Bank in social protection, culminating in a Social Protection Project (FY13) which
will support government in consolidating and making operational a social safety net system (as opposed
to a collection of programs) to protect the poorest and most vulnerable from chronic poverty and seasonal
and unpredictable shocks, and support the implementation of the productive social action strategy
(possible through a cash-for-work intervention in urban and rural areas).
102. The conservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity are the building blocks toward
better resilience to natural disasters and livelihood vulnerability. The on-going Transfrontier
Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project II (FY06), which is co-financed by the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) with the Bank, has contributed to building the country's capacity to manage
biodiversity in protected areas, in particular by supporting national reforms and on-the-ground investment
in five protected areas. The follow-on project under preparation, Transfrontier Conservation Areas and
Tourism Development Project III (FY14), also to be co-financed with GEF, looks to scale up the
partnership with local communities and to further improve biodiversity management capacity. These
national parks represent valuable tourism assets, but they deserve attention for their global value as well
as for many other ecosystem services. Mozambique contains a wide diversity of habitats, including
mountainous, woodland, wetland, and coastal/marine ecosystems. These large areas are important for
their richness of biodiversity and because they contain topographic and ecological gradients and transition
zones, and historical corridors for large-scale animal movements, which will become increasingly
important with habitat modification due to climate changes. Increasingly, the ecosystem services provided
by these protected areas are valued as buffer to land degradation and disasters such as flood or drought.
They are also ―insurances‖ for the most vulnerable livelihood in rural areas by providing an array of wild
resources ranging from energy, meat protein, construction material, and medicinal plants.

(c) Governance and Public Sector Capacity: The Foundation
103. Weak governance and public sector capacity underlie Mozambique’s myriad development
challenges. All activities discussed under Pillars I and II require a strengthened public sector capacity and
improved governance deciding on the most effective way to mitigate high international food and fuel
prices; channeling benefits of mineral wealth to ease people out of poverty; lifting legal and regulatory
constraints to access finance; planning and implementing integrated spatial development along growth
corridors; and bridging urban-rural disparities in service delivery. Every Bank project includes activities
that enhance the Government’s ability to develop strategies, plan, budget, manage, implement, and
monitor. Institution building is fully mainstreamed throughout the portfolio. And as the consultations for
42

the Africa Regional Strategy conveyed clearly, ―governance and leadership were the most important
factors driving Africa’s future development.‖ And just like the Africa Regional Strategy, the
Mozambique CPS considers this the ―foundation‖ upon which the pillars, in fact, the entire Bank
program, rests. And while every product and service undertaken during the CPS period can be ―mapped‖
to Governance and Public Sector Capacity, this Foundation has specific objectives, projects and analytic
work in the area of economic governance, social accountability, and natural resources management (see
Tables 7 and 8).
104. Beyond institutional capacity components in its projects, the Bank is supporting greater
transparency and accountability primarily through reforms in public financial management. The
PRSC series in particular will continue to support reforms to improve financial management and
procurement while possibly broadening its scope to better respond in a timely way to other likely
changing realities on the ground over the CPS period. A challenge is to broaden and deepen these
reforms to decentralized levels as well as in sector ministries at the central level. Given the
decentralization process and the deconcentration of functions, including the provision of service delivery,
to the provincial and district levels, two on-going programs are supporting the former. The Maputo
Municipal Development Program II (FY11) is building on the successful implementation of the first
phase and aims to continue efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Maputo City Council to plan, finance,
manage, and maintain urban services and infrastructure. Similarly, the municipal strengthening
component of the Coastal Cities and Climate Change Project (FY12) will support 19 municipalities in
the central and southern regions of the country in the areas of financial management and
urban/environmental planning. The project will continue the long-term engagement of the Bank in the
area of municipal development and will bring additional resources to strengthen both the municipal and
relevant sectoral agencies. The National Decentralized Planning and Finance Project (FY10) is the
Bank’s contribution to a common fund that aims to improve the capacity of local government to manage
public financial resources for district development and to better integrate district planning and budgeting
into the national systems. The project seeks to achieve this objective through technical assistance and
capacity building, and institutionalization and mainstreaming of best practices in all districts of the 10
provinces. The public expenditure reviews and health financing study will also provide information to
help improve inefficient public spending in human development.
Table 7. Objectives and Expected Outcomes of Governance and Public Sector Capacity

 Improved citizen participation in public service monitoring

Strengthened non-renewable, renewable natural

 Greater contribution of wildlife conservation to economy
 Improved transparency in extractive industries

105. The objective of the Economic Governance Project (FY13) will be to lift key procurement,
public financial management, human resources, and monitoring and evaluation bottlenecks to
service delivery in selected sectors. The action to take is narrowing the gap between PFM and
procurement policy, rules and systems, and their actual implementation. Service delivery sectors will be
43

used as entry points to narrow the gap between PFM and procurement reforms and their implementation.
A Program-for-Results component may be used to provide incentives for the development of common
solutions to service delivery problems identified in the key sectors targeted (health, education, justice, and
agriculture). A PFM and procurement technical assistance component will complement the Program-forResults component. The technical assistance component will aim to address the critical PFM,
procurement, human resource issues; but it would do so by focusing the attention of the authorities on the
―softer‖ aspects of the implementation of these reforms, such as change management and communication,
and by encouraging them to identify the real nature of the issues and the level of local capacity rather than
jumping on good practice for ready-made solutions. The technical assistance component would also
include a knowledge window that aims to gather analytical evidence on the causes of poor service
delivery. In light of the governance environment in Mozambique, it would also put a strong emphasis on
social accountability mechanisms in order to increase the demand for better public services and leverage
the ―short route‖ to accountability.

mainstream social accountability and public voice
either as integral components of projects or as complementary activities, building on lessons learned from
on-going work by civil society groups and in partnership with them and other development partners
similarly interested in building social accountability measures in their respective programs.

107. One area of governance that has grown in importance in recent years is the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Government has made a strong commitment to develop its
natural resources in line with global best practice guided by transparency principles. Mozambique is
currently an EITI-candidate country. The Bank has been working with other development partners to
support the Government in this process. During the CPS FY12-15 period, the Bank through a Mining and
Gas TA Project (FY13) will continue to help improve the legal, fiscal, and regulatory frameworks; create
provisions to facilitate adequate contribution of the sector to economic development and regional levels;
and improve extractive industries sector transparency and build capacity for sector revenue estimation and
collection, and revenue management.
108. Over the last 15 years, the World Bank has supported the Statistical Office of Mozambique
(INE). Bank support has focused particularly in the collection and analysis of micro data. Recent
achievements include the new Atlas of Mozambique, an important analytical tool based on the 2007
44

census and 2008/2009 household survey that maps the socio-economic characteristics of the country and
compares them with 1997 census and survey findings. Despite solid collaboration, there is scope for a
stronger partnership. INE still needs support to develop a coherent long-term plan of work as well as to
improve its technical capacities. As shown by the last household survey (2008-09), a number of
weaknesses still affect INE in various areas, from the design of questionnaires, to the collection of data,
and finally to the early stages of data analysis. In this regard, the Bank plans to avail itself as needed for
the next household survey, tentatively scheduled for 2014. Bank support to INE would complement the
support provided by the Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish aid agencies through the Scanstat program
which looks to improve institutional capacity, general statistics, census taking, and surveys.

III. IMPLEMENTING THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
A. Resources to Implement the Strategy
109. The CPS covers the three years of IDA 16 (FY12-14) and the first year of IDA 17 (FY15). The
CPS operational program was calibrated based on an assumption of annual IDA-16 lending envelopes in
the order of US$346 million for a total notional IDA allocation of US$1.04 billion. Actual allocations
will depend on (a) the country’s own performance; (b) its performance relative to other IDA recipients;
(c) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (d) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible
countries; and (e) terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); (f) the amount of compensatory
resources received for MDRI; and (g) availability of IDA resources that could be reallocated.
Mozambique may also avail of IBRD financing for enclave projects in the energy, transport, logistics, and
minerals and gas sectors.
110. In keeping with the African Regional Strategy, the Bank will continue to leverage IDA
resources to mobilize external financing and to ensure a greater concentration of resources to
address key challenges. The Mozambique program has already demonstrated a good track record of
leveraging external financing in the form of donor trust funds, with US$149 million in trust fund
resources activated during the previous CPS period (FY08-11). Total active trust fund resources as of
end-FY11 stood at US$216 million in the form of co-financing or as stand-alone arrangements. In
addition, two active projects, the National Decentralization Planning and Finance SIL (FY10) and the
Education Sector Support Project (FY11) with a combined commitment of US$100 million are part of a
basket funding arrangement with non-Bank donor resources estimated at about US$360 million. The
Bank is also one of 19 budget support donors that provided US$471 million in 2011 (the Bank’s
contribution was US$85 million). Many other active projects are part of broader programs of coordinated
support where other donors and the Government alike fund related activities.
111. In regard to human resources, the Bank will maintain a decentralized and high-capacity
Mozambique country office. Of the 19 active IDA projects currently in the portfolio, 14 are managed
by task team leaders based in the country office. Another two are based in neighboring countries, while
three are based in Washington. There has been good progress over the years to provide local senior staff
with task management experience in other, mostly Lusophone countries. The Bank office in Maputo
includes a Country Director, the Lead Economist, and Sector Leaders for Sustainable Development,
PREM, and Human Development. Senior fiduciary staff covering financial management, procurement,
and social / environmental safeguards are also based in the country office. The IFC office is headed by a
45

resident Country Manager, with 8 professional investment and advisory staff. In total, the country office
comprises 75 staff and consultants (including IFC), of which 27 (or 36 percent) are internationally
recruited.

B. Partnerships and Donor Coordination
112. The Africa Regional Strategy emphasizes the importance of partnerships as the foremost
important instrument to implement country strategies. Indeed, the Mozambique country program
views partnerships – with Government, development partners, the private sector, and local institutions –
as an indispensable aspect of our work. Partnerships entail close operational coordination with
development partners, leveraging IDA resources to mobilize external financing, and taking a catalytic and
convening role to mobilize the attention, resources, and technical skills of others. The Bank’s current and
proposed work program provides many examples of such partnerships:
 Leveraging external resources: the Bank’s active TF portfolio is about $200 million and
complements an IDA portfolio of about $1 billion in net commitments.
 Budget support: the Bank closely coordinates its budget support operations with 19 other donors,
ensuring a coordinated dialogue on key policy issues. In FY11, the Bank disbursed $85 million
out of a total $450 million in donor budget support.
 Basket funding arrangements: currently, the Bank is providing a combined commitment of $100
million to support basket funding arrangements in decentralization and education with other
donor resources estimated at about $360 million.
 Program coordination: the Bank and other donors have formal geographic divisions of
responsibilities to support Government programs in roads, agriculture, and water.
 Catalytic role: the Bank has played a catalytic role in the planned Regional Transmission
Development Project (FY13), providing $150 million in total IDA resources to crowd in
approximately $1 billion from private sector and development partners.
 Convening power: over the past two years, the Bank has organized (with financing support by
donors) flagship workshops with top Government policy makers on growth, inviting speakers
from around the globe to discuss various growth strategies, models, and lessons learned.
 WBG partnerships: the Bank’s program in Mozambique benefits from extensive collaboration
across the WBG, with strong synergies with IFC and MIGA programs to strengthen the
investment climate, infrastructure provision, agribusiness, SMEs, tourism, energy, and even
climate change resiliency. The Mozambique program is facilitating joint work between DEC
and the Prime Minister’s office on growth and employment creation. Collaboration with WBI
will be strengthened over the next four years: beyond current joint work on urban management,
WBI will help strengthen the Government’s capacity for communication dissemination.
 Knowledge generation: the Bank is in the works to set up a TF with DFID to finance analytic
work on growth and economic governance. A key aspect of the TF entails efforts to collaborate
and forge closer relationships with local think tanks and academic institutions. WBI will assist
in improving capacity of these institutions.
113. Donor aid coordination in Mozambique is highly structured and to a large degree, facilitates
strong partnerships across the range of development actors. The Bank, together with the UN, co46

chair the Development Partners Group (DPG) which is a forum for substantive discussions among
development partners and coordination among numerous donor programs and project activities.
Quarterly ―extended‖ DPG meetings include presentations on inclusive growth, rural development,
climate change adaptation, management of agricultural land, social protection, and post-disaster response.
They have also drawn high level government participation and serves as an informal forum to exchange
ideas on key development challenges.
114. Donor budget support is coordinated through the Group of 19 donors (G19), including the
World Bank. The group is chaired on a rotation basis with Canada currently chairing. The
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in March 2009 between the Government and the G19 is
based on a set of ―fundamental principles‖: (a) predictability and alignment with domestic systems; (b)
monitoring has to be done jointly and all policy actions or expected outcomes in the program have to be
based on the common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF); (c) no separate reporting to the donors
is required; and (d) mutual accountability is a primary factor to be included.40
115. The G19 system has brought substantial benefits in terms of streamlining and harmonizing
the donor dialogue with the Government. And while there is scope for introducing greater flexibility in
the G19 processes and systems, the past year has seen some significant changes. Budget support
decisions were previously based on policy actions or outcomes introduced in the PAF matrix three years
prior. Starting in 2012 and reflecting the newly introduced concept of a ―dynamic PARP‖, such decisions
will be based on indicators agreed to from the previous year and allows the Government to adjust
priorities and targets in light of changing economic and social conditions, or changing priorities and
strategic orientation. Hence the PAF could be modified to take into account analytic work or new sector
strategies, such as the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development, the Financial Sector Development
Strategy, and the Strategy for the Improvement of the Business Environment. Still, greater flexibility
could allow indicator-based disbursement brought forth in real-time and reflecting changing conditions
(e.g., external shocks) or new government priorities. Second, there could be a better balance in the PAF
between outcome indicators and policy reform actions. The PAF is heavily skewed toward the former.
This is a challenge for the preparation of PRSCs since Bank policy requires that DPL operations should
disburse against the completion of policy and institutional actions.
116. The donor harmonization system in Mozambique could be strengthened further by
consolidating the policy dialogue in a smaller number of working groups, which would lead to
improved prioritization and efficiency. Implementation of the PARP will be monitored through sector
working groups with indicators included in the PAF assessed during the Annual Review typically
scheduled in April. This work is complemented by September Planning Meetings to agree on the
indicators and triggers for the following year. The sector working groups can be good vehicles for policy
dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the Government and all the donors
involved in a specific sector. At present, this donor coordination system is organized around 29 main
sector working groups, which involve government participation and 43 additional donor-only subgroups.
An unintended consequence of this large number of groups is that the policy dialogue tends to be
excessively fragmented, focusing too narrowly on specific issues discussed across many different
40

47

meetings. This makes prioritization and dialogue difficult — while imposing a heavy burden on the time
commitments of all involved. Annexes 12 and 13 provide a summary of donor support by sector.

C. The Bank Portfolio Performance
117. Over the course of the CPS FY08-11 period, the Bank delivered its largest program for
Mozambique (Figure 5). The Board approved US$1,016 million in IDA for 17 new lending projects and
three additional financing projects. New deliverables accelerated in the last year of IDA 15 in FY11 as
seven new projects were approved. Record lending has resulted in a fairly large active portfolio
comprised of 19 IDA projects and a net commitment amount of US$976.1 million. However, despite the
growth of the portfolio, the average project size has remained constant, averaging US$46.6 million, below
the Africa Region’s average of US$73.6 million (Figure 6). This has led to fragmentation of the portfolio
that will need to be remedied through preparation of umbrella projects that are likely to be programmatic,
multi-sectoral, and is of sufficiently large scale to maximize development impact.
Figure 5. IDA Commitments and Projects

Figure 6. Average Size of New IDA Projects

118. As agreed to with Government, Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) take place
twice a year. The focus on the CPPR alternates between (1) a focused discussion on specific projects and
issues impeding smooth implementation and disbursement; and (2) a broader discussion of systemic and
institutional issues that affect the entire portfolio, including those of other donors. An example of the
latter included the challenges the Bank and other donors experience using country systems, given the ongoing transition to newly automated financial management systems and procurement and audit
procedures. Moving forward, greater effort will be made to incorporate into the CPPR exercise a greater
results orientation to keep track of progress toward achieving key program outcomes.

IV. RISKS AND MITIGATION
119. Reduced donor assistance. As one of the largest recipients, Mozambique is heavily dependent on
donor assistance, which is estimated at about 20 percent of GDP. Donor budget support comprises about
40 percent of the Government’s budget. However, economic difficulties in donor countries may lead to
less predictable aid and other financial inflows. In anticipation of such reductions, the Government is in
discussion with the Bank about possibly raising the level of budget support. Such potential increases
would likely need to correspond to an acceleration of reforms, particularly to the overall business climate
and to constraints in key sectors. In such a tightening environment challenges of donor coordination are
likely to intensify. In addition, given the desire to develop its energy and natural resource industries, the
48

Government may also look at IBRD enclave financing, as well as IFC and MIGA products and services.
Bank and other donor policy dialogue will continue to underline the need to continue improving on
revenue generation and collection, and to allocate meager budgets to a few strategically targeted
programs, reforms, and industries that have the potential to compete and provide a source of revenue
needed for development spending.
120. External shocks. There are risks related to the potential for macroeconomic shocks and their
impact on the implementation and achievements of the government reform program. The current
deterioration and high uncertainty of the global economy brings with it risks of deteriorating terms of
trade, reduction of FDI, and potential reductions in donor disbursements, especially through budget
support. As for mitigation measures, the Government is following the course that helped them manage
the 2008-09 crisis by maintaining a high level of reserves, a flexible exchange rate regime, and keeping
low external debt vulnerability. Additionally, Mozambique has a stable relationship with the IMF,
anchored on a Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which has contributed to solid macroeconomic
management. The elaboration of the new PARP contributed to deepening the communication and to
address differences of views that could have lead to reduced donor support. Over the long run,
Government is keen to continue to build its own revenue base to gradually reduce dependency of foreign
aid. While the risk of macroeconomic shocks affecting the reform program is moderate, it requires
constant attention to changing circumstances.
121. Slowing pace of reform. The drop in Mozambique’s ranking in the 2011 Doing Business report
reflects both accelerated reforms in other countries, but also a much slower pace of reform in
Mozambique over the past year.41 If this is an indicator of a broader trend, the ability of Mozambique to
foster a vibrant private sector will be greatly impaired and may trigger the reduction of donor aid. The
Government is working closely with the donor community and private sector groups to update its set of
priority business climate reforms, a complement to the PARP that will provide a blueprint for discussion
on private sector development.
122. Capacity constraints and weak client coordination. Notwithstanding significant progress over
the past two decades, a deep-seated and persistent challenge for Mozambique will be its still largely
fragile capacity, especially at technical levels across the board. In the important agricultural sector for
example, with an irrigation project recently achieving effectiveness, a regional agriculture productivity
project under preparation, and an Agriculture DPO in the pipeline, the agriculture sector is receiving
appropriate emphasis in the CPS for FY12-15 as an engine of economic growth and poverty reduction.
However, given capacity constraints at the Ministry of Agriculture, the Bank will have to closely monitor
on-going activities, including technical assistance and institutional capacity development. The Bank is
also looking at alternative ministries for future projects, e.g., housing the Agriculture DPO under the
Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD). Relatedly, the slew of multisector projects – including
the Growth Poles Development, Economic Governance, and Climate Change DPO – will test the
Government’s ability to coordinate across ministries and agencies. The Bank will work closely with the
Ministry of Planning and Development, as well as the Prime Minister’s office, to ensure such high-profile
projects receive the appropriate level of coordination required for implementation.

123. Management of extractive industries. The Government at the highest levels has expressed
concern over the ability to manage the burgeoning mining and gas sectors and the entry of large
multinational firms looking to negotiate and sign contracts. Given the potential ―game changer‖ that
these sectors represent, the Government aims to maximize the benefits to the country, particularly in
terms of revenue sharing. Negotiating deals of this magnitude requires international and sectoral expertise
that the Government currently lacks. The Bank Group as a whole, building on on-going mining and gas
policy dialogue and advice, as well as positive experience with EITI-related work, is inter alia preparing a
TA project to address identified policy and capacity gaps. The proposed project will support reforms,
initiatives, and capacity building to enhance the efficiency and accountability of institutions involved in
the management and planning of the mining and hydrocarbon sectors.
124. Possible elevation of social tensions. Recent global events have shown that no government is
immune to social unrest stemming from a lack of economic opportunities and unresponsive governance.
The related events of 2008 and 2010 were perhaps wake-up calls for Government to do more to address a
slowing pace of poverty reduction, create employment and improve livelihoods, and to provide a
minimum level of social protection for vulnerable populations. The CPS for FY12-15 supports these
efforts. In addition, by integrating social accountability mechanisms throughout its program, the Bank
hopes to give rise to citizens’ voices and increase participation as a means to improve accountability and
delivery of public goods and services.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Completion Report assesses the World Bank Group’s assistance
to Mozambique during the FY08-11 period as guided by the Mozambique CPS (Report No. 39395-MZ). It reviews
the support provided to Mozambique through a mix of investment instruments, partnerships and knowledge
products and assesses (i) the program performance in influencing the CPS outcomes as laid out in the CPS results
matrix and (ii) the World Bank Group’s performance with regard to relevance, design and management of the
strategy. The last chapter summarizes lessons drawn from this assessment which should feed into the design of
the follow-up Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
2.
Overall, this report concludes that the Bank’s program performance is considered to be only Moderately
Satisfactory for the FY08-FY11 CPS. Although the Bank’s program over the CPS period was relevant, adequately
designed, responsive to Government requests, integrated with the overall development partner harmonization
agenda, and the anticipated portfolio was successfully delivered (even surpassing its foreseen scope in terms of
lending and grant amounts), there were some slippages in the portfolio. While most of the results were
achieved as outlined in the CPS results framework and good progress was made in other areas, the results
achieve were uneven across the portfolio and the results matrix was never updated, rendering some outcomes
unobservable. A detailed assessment of achievements against outcomes as measured by indicators in the CPS
results framework is presented in Table 1 in the Annex.
3.
Thus, despite the impressive delivery of a much larger lending program than anticipated and
maintaining an overall effective and well performing portfolio for most of CPS period as well as delivering a
number of high-quality and timely knowledge products, the Bank’s performance is assessed only moderately
satisfactory, mainly due to the: (i) failure of undertaking a CPS progress report causing a number of stale CPS
outcomes, (ii) slippages in the portfolio leading to delays in results delivery and the (iii) deterioration of portfolio
performance towards the end of the CPS implementation period. Table 2 and 3 of the Annex present the
detailed listing of newly committed lending and major grants over the CPS period.
4.
The details of the CPS Completion Report as presented in the following reflect a comprehensive selfevaluation undertaken by the country team, in which actual achievements were evaluated against outcomes
defined in the CPS results matrix. The assessment is based on several sources, such as project specific data from
ISRs and ICRs, portfolio data from institutional systems, as well as economic and sectoral assessments and
interviews with Bank staff. Finally, the report included consultations with development partners and key
ministerial and project counterparts.
A. Progress Towards Mozambique’s Long Term Objectives over the CPS Period
5.
Premised on macroeconomic stability and improved public financial management, the overarching goal
of Mozambique’s 2006-10 Poverty Reduction Strategy, the PARPA II, was the reduction of poverty through
sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition to eight cross-cutting topics highlighting key development
priorities, the PARPA II is organized around three pillars: Governance, Human Capital, and Economic
Development.

59

6.
At the beginning of the CPS period Mozambique had posted a strong 8 percent average GDP growth rate
for a number of years, making it one of Africa’s best-performing economies. Together with sustained political
stability after a two-decade long civil war, the country was able to attract substantial development partner
support. Mozambique was also able cope relatively well with the global food, fuel, and financial crises and
consequent global economic slowdown. The Government has repeatedly addressed external shocks with rapid
and flexible policy responses, seeking IMF resources to maintain prudent levels of reserves while allowing the
exchange rate to depreciate gradually. As a result, economic growth continued to be strong: real GDP growth
dipped slightly from 6.7 percent in 2008 to 6.4 percent in 2009, and is expected to post at 6.5 percent in 2010.
According to the latest IMF Article IV Consultations, Mozambique’s medium-term outlook remains favorable and
economic growth is projected to accelerate to 7¼ percent in 2011 and close to 8 percent over the medium term.
7.
After significant strides in poverty reduction between 1996 and 2002/3, the results of the 2008-09
household survey suggest that overall poverty reduction has leveled off at roughly 55 percent of the population.
Notwithstanding concerns about the reliability of national poverty data, the results also indicate that urban
poverty continued to decline but at a much slower rate, reaching 50 percent, while rural poverty actually
increased slightly to 57 percent. These decelerating pace of poverty reduction point to structural deficiencies,
weaknesses in the Government’s growth strategy, and the narrow productive base of the economy which leaves
significant challenges to be addressed.
8.
The agriculture sector, while contributing 24 percent of GDP and employing 78 percent of the country’s
workforce, has witnessed private sector investments in specific subsectors in response to existing market
opportunities but continues to consist largely of subsistence farming in which 85 percent of rural households are
engaged. The manufacturing sector, accounting for 13 percent of GDP, is led by a few capital intensive megaproject investments, most notably aluminum smeltering, that represents 62 percent of the production value of
the entire sector but only about 3 percent of the sector’s employment. Meanwhile, reforms to the business
climate have been slow, particularly in accessing finance which continues to impede the competitiveness of the
vast majority of firms, primarily small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which mostly compete in the local
market.
9.
Despite concerns with the Government’s current growth strategy, substantial improvements in the
provision of public goods were recorded, particularly in transport infrastructure, electricity, urban and rural
water, and telecommunications. Entrepreneurs, for example, are now less worried with energy provision, than
they were in 2003 according to the 2009 Investment Climate Assessment. Also Mozambique’s business
environment has shown some improvements. The 2011 Doing Business survey indicates an improved overall
ranking in terms of the ease of doing business, with progress on legal reforms, simplified licensing procedures,
and protecting investors, ranking Mozambique as number 140 in 2009 and 135 in the 2010 Doing Business
Reports. Nevertheless registering property, dealing with construction permits, access to credit, paying taxes,
trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and closing a business are all areas where progress has lagged.
10.
Weak governance structures remain a challenge for Mozambique’s business climate. The World Bank’s
Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) note improvements since 2004 across five indicators, most prominently
that for political stability but also those measuring government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and
control of corruption, but with the exception of political stability, all other indicators for Mozambique in the
2009 assessment fall below the 50th percentile. On voice and accountability, Mozambique’s percentile showed a
60

modest slippage. Corruption consistently ranked among the top constraints to businesses, particularly among
SMEs, and irregular payments with respect to customs, taxes, licenses, regulations, and services add up to
significant costs. Perceptions of corruption have remained steady according to Transparency International’s
Corruption Perception Index which shows Mozambique’s ranking remaining relatively stable, from 111 out of
179 countries in 2007 to 116 out of 178 countries in 2010. And while there has been stepped up efforts by the
development partner community to engage civil society organizations and to increase voice and participation,
tangible results beyond the demonstration effects of development partner projects have been slow to
materialize. The progress made towards a comprehensive decentralization policy and intergovernmental fiscal
framework has been substantial in the past decade, significant gaps still exist particularly in the area of
intergovernmental fiscal systems and municipal finance. One area that has shown significant progress has been
the introduction of investment budgets for districts and the transfer of human resource management to the
district level, as well as the creation of local councils, all contribution to citizens’ voice and accountability.
11.
Mozambique’s social indicators and its progress toward the MDGs have shown good results, however,
based on the results of the recent household survey, the country needs to accelerate efforts to reduce poverty to
achieve this goal by 2015. Expenditures on PARPA priority sectors have been maintained at about 65 percent of
total expenditures since 2004 and public services have improved over the past decade. However, social progress
is uneven and the richest have benefited most in electricity, health, and secondary education, while primary
education has particularly benefited the poor. The MDG for sustainable coverage for water supply could be met
given the rapid improvements in the provision of urban water supply, while access in rural areas continues to lag
and the MDG sanitation targets are very unlikely to be met, especially in peri-urban areas. While there has also
been substantial progress in gender equality and women’s empowerment, reduction of child mortality and
improving maternal health, as well as immunizations, exclusive breastfeeding, and supervised deliveries, the
country’s health status indicators continue to be below the Sub-Saharan Africa average.
12.
Mozambique still has the lowest ratio of health providers per population in Southern Africa, and
HIV/AIDS continues to pose serious long-term challenges, despite significant progress in the access to AntiRetroviral treatment (ART) throughout the country over the CPS period. A 2009 national survey estimates the
HIV prevalence rate among the adult general population at 11.5 percent. The epidemic seems to be leveling-off
notwithstanding the increasing trend of HIV prevalence observed in the southern region, particularly in Maputo
where the prevalence rate is estimated at about 20 percent.

II. CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
B. Program Overview and Principles of Engagement
13.
The Bank program in Mozambique was predominantly delivered in the form of investment loans and
grants and a PRSC series for general budget support in the overall amount of US$ 1,047 million including
regional operations and additional financings. Out of these, US$ 345 million were committed for the PRSC series
over the four year program. The lending portfolio was complemented by a considerable and growing Trust Fund
program. Over the CPS period an overall of US$ 252.4 million in Trust Funds were signed, with the Education For
All Catalytic Trust Fund taking the lion share of US$ 79 million signed in FY 09 and US$ 90 million signed in FY11.
Other large Trust Funds were committed in the Water Sector (twice US$ 15mill), the Environment/ Tourism
61

sector with a GEF/PHRD grant contribution to the Trans-Frontier Conservation Area & Tourism Development
Project of US$13.7million, and the Agricultural Sector (US$ 6.2 million).
14.
Engagement under the CPS followed the three principles of “Collaborate-Focus-Deliver” with a strong
anchoring in partnership with Government and other donors. The Bank took an active role in development
partner harmonization to achieve overall of eighteen outcomes which the CPS for FY08-11 set out to achieve.
The CPS was organized in three broad pillars: (1) Increased Accountability and Public Voice: (2) Equitable access
to key sectors; (3) Sustainable and broad-based growth and measured with 28 outcome indicators. The CPS
results framework indicates how the policy and investment areas under each pillar are aligned with PARPA II
objectives. Because a mid-term CPS Progress Report (PR) was not undertaken, the Bank missed an opportunity
to take stock of progress against envisioned outcomes and as a result, a number of outcome indicators that
should have been replaced, clarified, or dropped due to changing circumstances and priorities were left in the
results framework. The majority of the outcomes that were observable with measurable indicators and were
pursued was “achieved” or “partially achieved”. Only three of the eighteen outcomes are considered “not
achieved”.
15.
The CPS Program by and large delivered the
anticipated results across the three pillars, but
exhibits uneven performance, and some delays in
demonstrating development impact. The results
framework was inadequately maintained throughout
the CPS period, missing opportunities to adjust for
changes in the portfolio and such rendering some
outcomes unobservable or not achieved. Due to this
shortcoming and some slippages in the portfolio, the
only moderately satisfactory.

1. Increased Accountability And Public Voice - CPS Pillar 1
17.
The PRSC series was the driving force behind the CPS program in the area “Increased Accountability and
public voice” and supported significant progress towards improving budget planning at central, district and
municipal levels, notably the strengthening of public financial management (PFM) systems. Improvements have
focused on the legal framework and the implementation of an integrated PFM information system (e-SISTAFE)
which has allowed the full transition from the previous system of advance payments towards a modern system
of direct budget execution. Roll-out of e-SISTAFE was also supported by the Public Sector Reform Project and the
system has been comprehensively introduced across central government and was accompanied by an extensive
training program, involving 1,850 users. The roll out of e-SISTAFE has exceeded the targets set for in the PRSC
series, both at the national and sub-national levels. Currently, over 90 percent of goods and services
transactions are carried out through the system via direct bank transfer from the Single Treasury Account, thus
improving transparency and information on public spending as well as reducing the risk of diversion of funds.
Besides the PRSC’s role as a vehicle to buttress reforms, the IMF took a central role through its use of structural
benchmarks to effectively implement e-SISTAFE, as pointed out by the IEG Country Study on Mozambique PRSCs
(IEG Working Paper 2010/7).
18.
Also supported by the PRSC and equally successful were measures to enhance revenue generation
capacity through the creation of the Central Revenue Authority. The IEG Country Study on Mozambique PRSCs
(IEG Working Paper 2010/7) confirmed that revenue collection is an area where most significant improvements
were observable during the PRSC series. Revenue targets were exceeded for 2009 by reaching 17.8% of GDP;
Coverage of internal audit and controls increased significantly and meeting the revised Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) targets for 2009 with 75% of central and provincial level bodies having operational internal
audit units which amounts to an increase of 50 percentage points over 2007. Another, more general indication
of the impressive improvements in PFM is provided by the PEFA assessment (December 2010), where the share
of indicators graded B or above has gone from 39 percent in 2004 to 61 percent in 2009. The CPS delivered also
two core ESW to support this results area, the CPAR Update and the Accounting and Auditing ROSC.
19.
The process of decentralization has provided an opportunity to promote demand-side governance
activities, including mainstreaming of social accountability mechanisms in order to enhance citizens’
participation in public sector management and the oversight of public resources. Unfortunately achievement of
63

CPS outcomes in the area of citizen oversight and improvements in legal and judicial services cannot be
sufficiently demonstrated as the CPS results framework was not adjusted to allow a selection of different
indicators. Due to the closure of the Public Sector Reform Project in unsatisfactory state, only some milestones
were achieved and both of the associated CPS outcomes appear as ‘not monitored’.
20.
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the CPS results framework, results achieved through the first
Decentralized Planning and Financing Project are witness to quite impressive progress as evidenced by ICR data
(Report Nr. ICR00001308). For instance, at the end of the project in 2009, all districts had District Consultative
Councils organized approving district plans and implementation reports over a zero baseline in 2004. All of the
128 districts have adopted methodologies for participatory planning and governance. A 2009 study of
community participation and consultation found that the project made a major contribution in creating
structures for community participation. Some 81 percent of respondents to the survey conducted said they were
aware of district investments and 88 percent of these expressed satisfaction with the results. In terms of
improving accountability and citizen voice the successful support for the completion and publication of data for
the population census by the Public Sector Reform Project should also be pointed out for its important
contribution to establish baseline data and reference points to measure improvement of public services.
21.
While the Public Sector Reform Project struggled with an ambitious agenda for a three-year
implementation period, the public sector team took to heart the lessons learned by dropping the originally
planned second phase of the APL to devise a more effective approach to reform and decided for a changemanagement model for the follow-up operation, now planned for FY12. The successful Decentralized Planning
and Financing Project was followed up with an operation in FY10 to sustain and further deepen the results
achieved at the district and local level. Despite the politically sensitive decentralization policy in Mozambique,
the new operation was successful in harmonizing development partner support under one common results
framework. The second Decentralized Planning and Financing Project also continues to support some of the
district communication strategies.
22.
Despite the highly satisfactory outcomes in the area of PFM, overall, outcomes for this pillar are
considered moderately satisfactory given the shortcomings of results achievement in improving legal and
judicial services, as well as improved government information and communication systems.
2. Equitable Access To Key Services - CPS Pillar 2
23.
The US$ 55mill HIV/Aids Response Project was successful in contributing to increased access to
information on and treatment for HIV/Aids and thus provided an effective response to an area that the CPS
had singled out HIV/Aids as perhaps the single greatest threat to Mozambique’s growth and development.
The MAP project was restructured to better contribute to the implementation process of the Government’s
National Strategic Plan to Combat STD and HIV/AIDS, notably the realignment of the CNCS (National HIV/Aids
Council), which aims to refocus the organization's role around the core functions of coordination and leadership
of the national HIV/AIDS response. Recently the CNCS Board examined and endorsed the decentralization of the
HIV/AIDS response to the local level. In addition, the Board considered the new proposed organic statute for the
CNCS, which seeks to ensure that the rules, staffing, recruitment and careers governing CNCS are based on the
common Government Public Service laws and regulations. This is an important step in ensuring sustainability of
the national HIV/Aids response.
64

24.
Over the period of the CAS, the number of people receiving ARV treatment increased from 34,000 in
2006 to more than 170,000 by mid 2010 according to Global Fund data. Since the project supported the national
HIV/Aids response, these results cannot be solely attributed to the project; however this figure far exceeds the
60,000 people envisioned in the CPS. The project’s last ISR reports that as of April 30, 2011, nearly 234,000 AIDS
patients were on ART or roughly 47% of HIV+ individuals who need ART. Over 900 health facilities in
Mozambique are providing PMTCT services to about 70,000 HIV positive pregnant women, representing a
coverage rate of about 46%. Overall, according to data from successive epidemiological surveillance (2003, 2005,
2007) and the INSIDA 2009, the HIV epidemic in Mozambique appears to be slowing down, notwithstanding the
continuing rise in the country’s southern region.
25.
Other than in the HIV/Aids program, the CPS was less successful in achieving improved equity in
health services, but was responsive to Governments request in quickly delivering an additional Health
Commodity Securities Project. Preparation of the Health Service Delivery Project was delayed and then
experienced another 10 months effectiveness delay. Although the latest ISR (Jan 2011) projects disbursements
of up to US$20 million during the calendar year, by end of the CPS period, it had only disbursed about one
percent of funds, mainly due to delays in submitting an acceptable procurement plan. This is juxtaposed by the
health team’s quick response to an urgent Government request to help avert the fall-out of the global financial
crisis which adversely affected the availability of key public health commodities and delivered an additional US$
39mill Health Commodity Security Project. The project became effective in February 2011 and aims at improving
supply chain management in the country, thus ensuring the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies in
Key Distribution Points.
26.
The institutional set-up for the national TEVET system was successfully created under the CPS.
However, the Technical and Vocational Education Project followed a rather ambitious design by creating the
institutions for a market-oriented and competency-based TEVET system and expecting results in labor-market
uptake for graduates of newly created qualification program within a five-year implementation period. The
project experienced implementation delays, in particular with regard to policy implementation as well as
institutional arrangements, but made significant strides towards setting up Mozambique’s TEVET system and
met the milestones the CPS set in this area: 19 qualifications and related modules have been developed in the
areas of Agriculture, Industrial Maintenance, Tourism and Administration and Management. However, the
indicator on labor-market uptake was unlikely to be observable under the projects or the CPS period; the
following CAS will have to closely monitor developments in the TEVET area, especially since the project received
additional financing in FY11 to scale up its impact.
27.
The CPS Results Framework did not include results in the area of access, quality and equity of primary
and secondary education, but great progress was made through the US$ 79mill Education For All Catalytic
Trust Fund (FY09). Supporting the implementation of the Government's Strategic Plan for Education and Culture
2006-2011, the first FTI project employed a pooled funds mechanism to move Mozambique’s education sector
closer to achieving the MDGs. The primary completion rate increased from 38% in 2007 to 48% in 2009 and the
illiteracy rate was reduced by 9 percentage points in the three-year period between 2007 and 2009. An
additional 7000 teachers graduated from pre-service training in the same period, according to the last ISR of the
project. The project is followed by another FTI and IDA combined investment of US$171mill in FY11 to continue
improving educational quality and picking up the delays in classroom rehabilitation and construction. Overall,
65

although not officially accounted for in the CPS, achievements in the general education sector which were
directly supported by the Bank’s program were significant.
28.
Progress in increasing access to potable water through the Water Services and Institutional Support
Project was significant under the CPS. The original US$15mill operation received additional financing of US$ 37
million in FY11 and has scaled up its activities to additional cities, now serving Beira, Dondo, Nampula,
Quelimane, Ilha de Mocambique, Mocimboa da Praia, Pemba, Tete, Chimoio, Gondola, Angoche, Moatize, and
Nacala. By end of June 2011, the project had connected an additional 192,443 urban dwellers to potable water,
and hence exceeded the CPS target of 53,000 people by far.
29.
This remarkable result was achieved despite the FY07 approved US$ 6 million Output-Based Payments
Grant to increase piped-water access to the poor in Maputo, Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba never took
off and has yet to be restructured to focus on Maputo only. Under the division of labor increased rural access
was supported by the African Development Bank with a programmatic lending approach. Although not
supported by Bank operations, access to clean water in rural areas has been growing at around 200,000 to
250,000 people per year in the four targeted provinces which exceeds by far the CPS target of adding 360,000
people over 4 years, The CPS should have clearly stated the division of labor in this area; however, taking into
account the impressive results, this oversight in managing the CPS shouldn’t impact the assessment of this
outcome.
30.
The CPS was successful in increasing access to sustainable and affordable electricity to institutions
outside of the power network, but did not fully attain its targets within the CPS period. Supported by the IDA
US$ 40 million Energy Reform and Access Project (ERAP), the CPS specifically focused on electrifying schools and
clinics with off-grid solar systems. Out of the 300 planned systems to be installed, 236 acceptance certificates
had been issued by the consulting engineer by May 2010. The remaining 64 facilities, plus an additional 100
facilities not foreseen in the CPS, will be completed by early 2012. The procurement and contractual delays have
now been resolved and the contractor for the remaining installations has now mobilized. Although not
measured by an outcome indicator, the on-grid electrification activities also supported by the project were very
successful in reducing the cost for new grid connections. While the project target was to decrease the new
connection cost to under US$ 950 per connection, in May 2010 the average cost was below US$ 700 by the end
of the project, thus by far exceeding the project’s target. In addition, approximately 28,000 new household
connections in project areas were completed by May 2011. Looking forward, this is a significant stepping stone
in ensuring the sustainability of electricity access expansion in Mozambique.
31.
Select achievements under this pillar are impressive but are contrasted by significant shortcomings
and delays in critical areas. Despite the excellent progress in the area of HIV/Aids prevention and treatment,
increased access to potable water and educational outcomes towards the MDGs, outcomes for this pillar cannot
be rated better than moderately satisfactory due to the shortfall in general health service delivery, delays in the
TEVET system as well as below-target numbers in institutional off-grid access to electricity.
3. Sustainable And Broad-Based Growth - CPS Pillar 3
32.
The CPS growth agenda was broadly delivered and achieved, although two critical areas either slipped
into the next CAS period or were dropped without being formally adjusted in the CPS framework which reflects
negatively on the otherwise satisfactory accomplishments. Guided by the overall goals of sustainable and
66

broad-based growth, this pillar grouped interventions supporting improvements in the investment climate and
financial sector, ICT and transport infrastructure, as well as agricultural development and strengthening the
tourism sector, one of Mozambique’s growth areas with great potential. Energy production, water resource
management and enhanced disaster response were also part of this pillar’s program. The investment lending
program and PRSC were supported by a knowledge program of ESW and TA products, including the High-Level
Policy Conference on Medium-Term Economic Policy Priorities, hosted by the Government of Mozambique and
jointly undertaken with the IMF, Bank and other donors, which was highly appreciated for its in-time and
adequate high-quality support to the client.
33.
Water resources management and disaster response are critical areas for Mozambique, a country that is
frequently exposed to floods on the one hand but has difficulty to serve its capital city with the necessary water
supply on the other hand. The National Water Resources Development Project addresses both aspects by
increasing the storage capacity of Corumana dam to ensure adequate supply to the Maputo piped system on
one hand, and supports the implementation of the National Water Resources Strategy on the other hand.
Unfortunately the project slipped into FY12, the next CAS period, mainly due to delays in preparatory studies
and the precautions and safeguards needed in projects that involve large dams. Disaster preparedness and
response in the meantime was supported by a GFDRR grant that made good progress in mainstreaming
integrated disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change into policies and strategies, such as the
Plano Quinquennal (Mozambique’s Five-Year National Plan) at the national and sector level.
34.
The Bank’s program made critical contributions to power sector development but the CPS outcome to
increase energy production for export, commerce and industry was not directly supported by project activities
undertaken during the CPS period. The CPS had anticipated the Bank’s involvement in increasing intra-regional
power trade via the Mozambique-Malawi Transmission Interconnection (SAPP APL-II) project. However, due to
political reasons in Malawi, the credit for the Malawi segment of the project was never signed and the credit is
due to be restructured to support the national energy sector in Mozambique. That said, several reform areas in
Mozambique’s energy sector were supported by Bank operations, such as the Energy Reform and Access Project
(ERAP APL-I), including the successful establishment of an independent, advisory regulator for the energy sector
in Mozambique. ERAP’s successor project, the Energy Development and Access Project (EDAP APL-II), which was
approved in March 2010, will continue to support on- and off-grid electrification as well as ongoing sector
reforms. In a related area, the water resources outcome was not achieved as anticipated, with the regional ESW
on the Zambezi Multi-Sector Investment Opportunities, the Bank provided high-quality analysis to inform future
sustainable development in the Zambezi valley, including irrigation, tourism and regional power development
and trade through the Southern African Power Pool.
35.
The ICT agenda was successfully delivered under the CPS by introducing competition in the
Mozambican telecommunications market. As a result, ele-density increased from 8% in 2000 to over 20% in
2008, a performance that is also remarkable in comparison to other regional countries. Building on the initial
success, the follow-up eGovernment and Communications Infrastructure Project (MEGCIP) project, delivered in
FY10, further improves competition, through the introduction of a third mobile operator, improves affordability
of international communications and internet services, and addresses the lack of competitively priced backbone
access, which constitutes one of the most severe barriers for operators. In addition the new intervention will

67

also reach direct beneficiaries by supporting the setup of up to 20 Community Multimedia Centers (CMCs)
throughout the country.
36.
Improvements in the Investment Climate, particularly with respect to the ease of doing business and
the strengthening the financial and Tourism sector were successfully supported by the CPS program. The
number of days to open a business was reduced from 90 in 2006 to 26 in 2009, surpassing the target set by the
CPS and the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) for General Budget Support. While the outcome was
supported by the PRSC series, the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, and the Competitiveness and
Private Sector Development Project, which is a US$ 25 million operation closing in 2014, aiming to accelerating
licensing reform and enhance business services for SMEs, an area that is also supported by IFC. The
Competitiveness operation will also provide matching grants schemes accessible to participating SMEs which is a
critical stepping stone in increasing access to finance.. The achievements in improving standards in the financial
sector exceeded the target of 80%, by 93% of banks fulfilling norms and IAS/IFRS in 2010 over a zero baseline in
2006. The CPS complemented its lending program in this area with the FSAP Follow-Up and Mozambique
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in FY09, a Growth Poles & Economic Zones analysis in FY10, the Regional
Investment Climate Assessment and the Regional Trade Report in FY11. IFC newly invested about US$43 million
in the banking Sector in Mozambique and otherwise realized roughly US$27 million in private sector investments
in the Oil, Gas and Mining Industry and Food and Beverages.
37.
IFC’s advisory services played a role in supporting the SME segment in Mozambique over the CPS
period but it is difficult to assess in measurable terms in how far the CPS succeeded to increase access to
finance for SMEs. IFC provided a rich program for SMEs through its Advisory Services mostly focusing on
business plan creation, which in turn would secure investment or lines of credit. IFC also financed capacity
building activities including for women entrepreneurs. Most prominently placed was IFC’s SME Initiative with
the general objective of creating a sustainable SME funding mechanism complemented by tailored advisory
activities to enable SMEs to better deal with issues related to business legalization, environmental and social
licensing, strategic and business planning, accounting and financial management, and other management issues.
38.
Tourism Sector Development progressed well under the CPS, albeit changes in the regulatory
environment are lagging behind. The Tourism sector was supported by two operations under the CPS, the
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development project, focusing on support to SMEs in the sector, and the
Trans-Frontier Conservation Area & Tourism Development Project (TFACTDP) supporting community
participation in tourism development, as well as IFC’s Tourism Anchor Investment Program. The number of bednights in tourism facilities in target districts increased to about twice the amount of the targeted 100,000 bednights by 2009, and, the TFACTDP also surpassed its targets for revenue generation by targeted protected areas
in Mozambique. The tourism agenda was also successfully supported by IFC Advisory Services securing a US$ 2.5
million investment for the Maputo Elephant Reserve for a partnership between a private sector investor and a
local community association and securing a US$ 30 million tourism investment for the Casuarina and Epidendron
Islands. The development is expected to create 650 jobs during construction and 250 jobs during exploration.
IFC also successfully supported regulatory reform in the tourism sector, including the Investment Law Regulation
which allows individual Integrated Tourism Resort projects to apply for Special Economic Zone status, the
Tourism Interest Zones Regulations which foresees that areas with special natural, cultural or historic
characteristics can be reserved for tourism development and the creation of a new government agency, the
68

Tourism National Institute (INATUR) in charge of tourism development and investment facilitation in ‘Anchor
Sites’. Despite these achievements and the successful development of Tourism Master Plans for three provinces,
critical sector reform processes, such as the award and management of tourism concessions on public land, are
delayed at the national level and should be closely monitored under the new CAS until the project closes in
2013.
39.
The CPS program was by and large successful in achieving the anticipated outcomes in the
transportation sector. Specific challenges became recently evident with the concessionaire for the Railway line
in the Zambezi Valley, as rehabilitation works were falling further behind, and line’s capacity and rolling stock
fleet were unable to meet the transport demand. This lead the performance of the Beira Railway Project to be
downgraded to unsatisfactory state, just nine months before the project’s closing end December 2011. The
Beira Railway Project built on the successful delivery of the Railway and Ports Restructuring Project that
restructured Mozambique’s Ports and Railway Parastatal (Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de Mozambique, E.P.CFM) and substantially increased the operating efficiency of the three major port-rail systems in Mozambique
and enabled them to increase their share of international freight traffic. The scheduled ESW on the
Concessionaire is delayed into FY12.
40.
In the roads sector, the Roads and Bridges Maintenance Project, delivered as an Adaptable Program
Loan, assisted the recipient successfully in setting up the National Roads Fund and increasing its revenues, which
in turn is the main mechanism to finance road maintenance. By end of the first phase of the APL revenue targets
were surpassed and such the sustainability of financing for road maintenance significantly strengthened. During
the CAS period, additional financing for the second phase of APL2 was delivered and together with support by
the PRSC, targets for the percentage of road network in good and fair conditions increased almost as planned
from 64% in 2007 to 71% in 2009, albeit falling short of the 78% target. The next CAS will have to closely monitor
maintenance and rehabilitation of roads assets.
41.
The agriculture sector in Mozambique faced considerable challenges but the CPS program successfully
supported the anticipated CPS results. Main vehicles of support were the PRSC, the Marked-Led Smallholder
Development Project, a Public Expenditure Review study of the agricultural sector and a set of high-quality set of
Land Policy Notes. The anticipated target of increasing access to public extension services from 222,000 in 2007
to 411,000 in 2009 was almost met in 2009 by reaching a total number of 364,752 peasants. However, extension
services, while critical, are only enablers for improved productivity and increased agricultural income. Together
with the US$ 70 million Sustainable Irrigation Development Project approved in FY 11, the agricultural sector
program will have to strengthen its policy dialogue and accelerate implementation to show real impact during the
following CAS period.
42.
Performance of the CPS program under this pillar was uneven across different sectors but overall
satisfactory despite the diverse set of challenges posed by a difficult policy environment and sometimes
diverging multi-development partner interests. Nevertheless, due to the inadequate results framework in some
of the targeted areas, outcome achievement under this pillar can only be considered moderately satisfactory.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
D. CPS Design and Relevance
69

43.
The FY08-FY11 CPS was relevant in its design by being developed in close alignment with Mozambique’s
PRSP, or PARPA II whose name is derived from the Portuguese acronym for the Second Action Plan for the
Reduction of Absolute Poverty. One of the main drivers of the CPS program was to address the challenge of
sustaining growth in Mozambique’s economy beyond the post-conflict catch-up that could be observed since
the end of the civil war in 1992. Other main challenges identified by the CPS were second generation policy and
regulatory reforms associated with the broad area of governance and the needs of the human development
agenda, including the paramount challenges posed by HIV/Aids. Responding to these challenges, and based on
sound preparatory analytical work, the CPS program was arranged in three pillars, (I) Increased Accountability
and Public Voice, (II) Equitable Access to Key Services, and (III) Sustainable and Broad-Based Growth.
44.
The CPS Results Framework was generally clearly organized, but the opportunity to adjust the program
through a progress report was missed causing detrimental effects for the results-based management of the
program.. The results matrix aligned the portfolio well with government development goals in an overall of
eighteen outcomes, grouped in five results areas and three pillars. While the framework could have defined
outcomes more selectively, by and large it was furnished with measureable outcome indicators. However the
CPS included end-of-project results for some pipeline operations which were impossible to be realized during
the CPS implementation period. Since no CPS Progress Report was prepared the opportunity to correct this
shortcoming was missed, and together with delays in project preparation, this lead to CPS outcomes rated as
‘not achieved’, while in fact they should have been dropped or adjusted and replaced with more suitable ones.
E. CPS Implementation
45.
Most of the lending program planned under the CPS was delivered and the World Bank Group adapted
well in response to emerging needs stemming from the Global Financial Crisis and other challenges. In summary
the World Bank Group made good use of the instruments available to successfully adapt the program to
changing needs. The country team delivered a considerable additional lending program that almost doubled the
original indicative lending volume through (i) higher than anticipated lending amounts for most operations, (ii)
Additional Financings to ongoing operations and (iii) additional projects.
46.
The initially anticipated CPS program exhibited some delays and a few slippages which occurred mostly
where complex operations were being prepared in sectors with a challenging political economy environment
such as water resources or agriculture. However, projects facing preparation delays mostly were eventually
approved with a higher than originally anticipated lending amount. About half of the new lending program was
approved in FY11, indicating bunching coinciding with the end of the IDA15 cycle.
47.
Overall the portfolio maintained its ‘healthy’ and ‘efficient’ state which is an indication for a well
managed portfolio, although portfolio performance took a downward turn in FY11. Equally, the high pro-activity
levels decreased to only 33% in FY11. This coincided with the delivery of more than 50% of new lending in FY11,
which is an astounding accomplishment given the CMU’s management challenges during this period. In addition,
preparation time was reduced from 15 to 9 months on average compared to the previous CAS period and is
lower than the average 12 months for the Africa Region overall. The country team carried out a rigorous CPPR
program with a strong results focus and follow-up on issues identified, such as intensified client capacity building
in procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation.

IEG ratings for exiting projects over the
CPS period which is considerably lower than the average for the Africa Region. Only one project, the Public
Sector Reform Project (FY03) exited with an unsatisfactory (both Bank and IEG) rating. Nevertheless, bunching,
delays and the leadership vacuum had a bearing on CPS portfolio effectiveness. Unfortunately no CPS Progress
Report was prepared to adjust the results framework to changing circumstances and to properly reflect
additional operations.
49.
The CPS included a demand-driven AAA program which was generally consistent with the areas of focus
of the Bank. In hindsight, the demand-driven approach worked well in responding in a timely manner to select
social and economic challenges (food/fuel price crisis, social protection), but could have benefitted from better
strategic programming. The slippage of the publication of one of the major ESW deliverables, the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), beyond the CPS implementation period into FY12, is an unfortunate
shortcoming. However, alternate AAA activities were highly successful and flexible in responding to the changing
circumstances, such as the global financial crisis. Notably the High-Level Policy Conference on Medium-Term
Economic Policy Priorities which was hosted by the Government of Mozambique and jointly undertaken with the
IMF, stands out with respect to providing in-time, high-quality knowledge support to the client. Having been cosponsored by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and the Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation, the conference is also an excellent example of development partner
collaboration. In addition, ESWs such as the ones on Municipal Revenues, Urbanization and the Water Sector
Public Expenditure Review proved the Bank’s ability to deliver high-quality knowledge products in time for
public policy planning as well as informing the lending program.
50.
Overall, progress was made to move forward the Paris Agenda on alignment and harmonization of
Development Partners according to the 2011 OECD Mozambique Evaluation Report on the Paris Agenda, but the
heavy aid architecture increasingly limits flexibility and efficiency. The PRSC series to provide direct budget
support was in line with the effort to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agenda, an explicit objective of the
CPS and based on recommendations from the previous CAS. The Memorandum of Understanding serves as the
main vehicle for coordination of budget support by the Budget Support Donors Group (G19). An elaborate setup of up to 72 working groups encompasses the overall aid architecture in Mozambique which is generally
believed to reduce transaction costs for Government. Conversely, the World Bank Group’s participation and lead
in a high number of working groups entails significant transaction costs at the Bank’s side and restricts
somewhat the flexibility in raising policy issues, although sector specialists, over time, have arrived at
appreciating the PRSC as a vehicle for generating more effective sector policy dialogue, as the IEG Country Study
on Mozambique PRSCs (IEG Working Paper 2010/7) points out.
51.
On the other hand, the three-year Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), used to monitor progress
against development outcomes for general budget support, was perceived as too rigid and the development
partner dialogue at times as challenging, particularly with regard to education and agriculture SWAPs. Donor
71

dialogue reached an impasse in early 2010 in the context of Mozambique’s General Elections, when multilateral
positions diverted significantly from the ones brought forward by bi-lateral donors with regard to demanding
political change. Despite the challenges of participating in a large group of donors with equal voice, Government
officials pointed out in the IEG Working Paper on Mozambique’s PRSCs that the Bank’s convening power lends
credibility to the general budget support program and appreciated the Bank’s technical expertise as an asset in
helping shape policy formulation. The same review however also encourages stronger Bank leadership on
analytical work as a foundation for the budget support program; a suggestion that should be taken seriously for
the upcoming CAS.
F. World Bank Group Performance Rating
52.
The World Bank Group delivered very successfully a stronger than anticipated lending program and
timely AAA products, yet the Bank’s performance falls short of a fully satisfactory rating for the following
reasons: The impact on the ground could have been even stronger with less slippages, tighter ESW programming
and the formal undertaking of the necessary adjustments through a CPS Progress Report. A major contributing
factor was certainly the transitional character of management during the second half of the CPS
implementation. The success of the strategy despite of these internal management challenges was due to the
consistently strong dialogue and close engagement with Government, and the continued strong management at
the portfolio and project level which off-set the overall lack of strategic leadership during the last third of CPS
implementation. Therefore the World Bank Group performance is overall rated as only “Moderately
Satisfactory”.

IV. KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEW CAS
53.
Poverty Reduction. Poverty has stagnated at roughly 55 percent of the population despite good levels
of growth in the economy and during the CPS period growing disparities between rural and urban poverty
became more apparent. At the same time there are concerns about the reliability of national poverty data. Over
the next CPS period considerable effort should be put towards providing appropriate analytical work to better
understand structural deficiencies and weaknesses in the Government’s growth and poverty reduction strategy.
Analytics of this kind need to have a thorough grounding in the country itself, going beyond participatory
approaches. The Bank, together with Government and other partners should explore avenues for
institutionalizing a permanent Think Tank with a strong policy evaluation unit that has, while being independent
from influence, enough political clout to be a driver of change. The AAA program and possibly a governance
focused operation should take this into account.
54.
CAS Monitoring. One of the significant shortcomings of the CPS was the failure to monitor CPS
outcomes and adapt to changes in the country environment and the portfolio. The upcoming CAS should take a
pro-active approach and have an annual stocktaking exercise on CAS milestones and implement the necessary
adaptations at mid-term together with a CAS Progress Report. CAS monitoring should be based on a more
selective results matrix with a smaller number of outcomes to avoid fragmentation of results. In addition, the
results framework should carefully take into account the level of results it can realistically achieve over the CAS
period, given the timeframe, risks and resources available of supporting operations. It would also be worth
72

trying to map investments per supported outcome as this may place particular attention to ‘high value’
outcomes.
55.
Leadership, Pipeline and Portfolio Management. Portfolio performance and pro-activity took a
downward turn towards the end of the CPS period. This coincided with challenges in the CMU’s leadership,
leaving key positions in acting arrangements for significant periods of time. Staff morale in particular at the
country office level suffered from a lack in readily available management guidance. Going forward the CMU
should ensure strong leadership for the country team and program to reinstate trust and stability. Going hand in
hand with this, strong and systematic portfolio management could help in addressing issues quickly and avoid
slippages in programmed lending and weaknesses in portfolio performance. As for the pipeline, candid analysis
of capacity (client and Bank) and the political economy of the concerned sectors could allow for a more realistic
assessment of preparation time and implementation readiness.
56.
Choice of Instruments - Investment Loans/Grants & PRSC: While the PRSCs are helpful in embedding
sector specific reforms within broader structural reforms in the economy and ensuring that the reforms are
aligned with national development strategies, they have their limitations. The successful implementation some
of the PRSCs was strengthened by the presence of complimentary technical assistance projects. This was
especially the case where capacity was weak. Going forward this cross-fertilization of PRSCs and sector
investment programs should be pro-actively used as an instrument to influence and impact outcomes on the
national development agenda.
57.
AAA Program: Going forward the CAS should lay out a more focused and planned AAA program related
to PRSC areas to inform the sector dialogue, as suggested by the IEG Country Program Evaluation (IEG 2010/07).
Together with more Public Expenditure Surveys, analytical work will then have a better chance of influencing
reforms on which in turn investment operations can build. The Bank team should also take seriously the
suggestion by the IEG s Country Program Evaluation (IEG 2010/07) to assume a stronger leadership role in the
budget support program, building on analytical work as a foundation. Besides other priority areas determined by
budget support areas and sector engagements, the analysis should focus on analyzing why poverty rates are
stagnating while Mozambique’s economy sustains high levels of growth.
58.
Aid Architecture: While Mozambique is still regarded as a good example of development partner
harmonization, the heavy aid architecture takes a toll in terms of transaction costs on development partner
sides. Under the upcoming CAS the Bank should take an active role in overhauling the heavy aid architecture in
Mozambique to let the entire development partner community benefit from efficiency gains. This may need
high-level dialogue beyond Head of Corporations/ Head of Missions level.
