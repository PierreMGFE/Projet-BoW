AZERBAIJAN COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, FY07-10
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Over the past few years, Azerbaijan has put into place both the infrastructure needed to
realize rapid growth in o i l and gas exports, and a credible framework to manage the increase in
resource flows in a reasonably effective and transparent manner. The World Bank Group has
been actively engaged in both tasks - through I F C in building the o i l pipelines which are now
generating the o i l boom, and through IDA in establishing the institutions responsible for
safeguarding and using the resources well. As Azerbaijan’s known reserves are more limited
than i s the case for many other o i l exporters, however, the resource boom will also be more
shortlived. The challenge facing the Azeri leadership and its international partners will
therefore be to use the next 10-15 years very carefully to develop sound growth opportunities
in the non-oil economy and achieve sustainable reductions in poverty for current and future
generations. To meet this challenge, the government o f Azerbaijan is committed to maintain
macroeconomic discipline; improve the business environment to encourage investment in the
non-oil economy; improve the transparency and quality o f public governance; modernize its
basic health and social protection systems; transform both its formal and nonformal education
and training systems to help its population become better educated and more competitive in an
increasingly global setting, and address long-neglected environmental problems. The longterm vision is for Azerbaijan to become a prosperous transit center for energy and goods
flowing between Europe and Central Asia.

2.
Azerbaijan i s just completing a first PRSP period, and i s now developing a new State
Programme on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development (SPPRSD) for 2006-1 5. The
Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) reflects the objectives o f the SPPRSD,
which are closely aligned with the vision and challenges mentioned above. The CPS rests on
four main pillars:

9 Pillar I:Improving the quality and transparency in public sector governance, by
maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework that makes prudent use o f o i l
revenues; improving public expenditure planning and management; strengthening
financial management and procurement systems; establishing proper public sector and
corporate governance, accounting, and auditing; creating an administrative and
regulatory environment conducive to growth; and strengthening the judicial system.
9 Pillar 11: Supporting sustainable and balanced growth o f the non-oil economy, by
expanding access to financial services; improving the business environment and
through I F C direct investments and technical assistance strengthening the private
sector; developing essential infrastructure and services, with special attention to both
the rural economy and Central Asia-South Caucasus-Black Sea regional transit routes;
and strengthening the financial viability and efficiency o f the utility sectors.
9 Pillar 111: Increasing the quality of and access to social services, by expanding
coverage o f good-quality health care services; developing a modern education system
and globally competitive knowledge economy; effectively targeting social assistance;
creating a more transparent, affordable, and sustainable pension system; and improving
living conditions and economic opportunities for internally displaced people.

>

Pillar IV: Improving environmental management and furthering the climate
change agenda, by cleaning up legacy pollution, reducing carbon emissions, and
promoting biodiversity; supporting more sustainable natural resource management in
selected areas; and strengthening natural disaster management.

...

111

3.
The Bank and IDA technical and financial assistance will focus o n Pillars I,
I11and IVY
and the Bank and I F C will work jointly o n Pillar 11. IFC will also continue to oversee the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and support the development o f financial institutions and
small and medium-size enterprises. I F C will actively seek direct investment opportunities in
general manufacturing and financial markets, as well as focused o n assisting local SMEs. Its
technical assistance activities will support the improvement o f the business environment and
corporate governance. Although Azerbaijan is not likely to require balance o f payments or
budgetary support through development policy lending during the next few years, i t has
requested that the Bank continue to support the PRSC reform agenda agreed under the previous
CAS, through intensive policy dialogue and technical advisory services.
4.
Implementation o f the public governance and anti-corruption agenda will be closely
monitored and prioritized o n the basis o f a framework prepared by the government with
participation o f civil society, and in partnership with donors. With regard to the Bank Group’s
own portfolio, special attention will be given to supervision generally and oversight o f
fiduciary requirements in particular, largely through strengthening capacity in the Baku
Country Office.

5.
Azerbaijan has already begun the transition from IDA to IBRD financing, with the first
IBRD loan approved in May 2005 and a second in January 2006. Based o n continued strong
economic growth prospects, IDA i s expected to be phased out during this CPS period. While
the average range o f IBRD lending is established at about US$250 million a year, actual
volumes will depend on the degree o f government co-financing and absorptive capacity. IBRD
lending will be sequenced so that progress in sector and governance reform can be taken into
account in decision-making at each step.
6.
Primary risks to achieving CPS objectives include: possible delays or waning
consensus in implementing structural reforms; state capture and corruption; deterioration in
financial management o f o i l revenues, disruptions in revenue flows due to volatile energy
prices, output or pipeline performance; and deterioration in the political or security
environment. These risks are mitigated by a strong emphasis on macroeconomic management
and sterilizing excess o i l revenues through the State Oil Fund, and renewed efforts at
improving relations with neighboring countries. The risks are also mitigated by the strong
focus o f the CPS on improving governance and financial accountability, diversifying sources
o f growth, and expanding participation o f the civil society in policy making and monitoring. At
the same time, i t is recognized that many countries experiencing natural resource booms have
had difficulty in managing macroeconomic and governance challenges. This CPS i s predicated
on the b e l i e f that Azerbaijan can follow a different path and that the World Bank Group can
play a positive role in helping to bring this about. The Board will be informed in the event o f
any serious deterioration o f the economic or governance environment.

The following issues are suggested for discussion:

P Does the CPS provide a well-focused set o f activities, both ongoing and new, in support o f
Azerbaijan’s development strategy?

P Does the CPS provide the appropriate mechanisms to further policy and governance
support?
P I s the governance framework well balanced between the Bank’s requirements and the
political and institutional reality o f Azerbaijan?

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, FYO7-10
REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

I.

Context

1. This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan covers the four-year period from
FY07 to FY10. I t i s a joint IDA/IBRD/IFC strategy. The last Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) was discussed by the Board in May 27, 2003 (Report No. 25790-AZ), based on
Azerbaijan’s then new poverty reduction strategy, the State Programme for Poverty Reduction
and Economic Development (SPPRED). A progress report on the SPPRED was presented to
the Boards o f the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in August 2005. In
collaboration with civil society and other stakeholders, the government i s preparing the followon to the SPPRED, the State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development
(SPPRSD) 2006-15.
2. Azerbaijan was among the world’s leading o i l producers in the late 19th century, but
during the Soviet period exploitation o f Azerbaijan’s o i l resources was not a high priority and
economic policies left little to show for the country’s o i l wealth and much o f its population in
poverty. Since independence, o i l and gas discoveries have given Azerbaijan new means o f
combating poverty and developing into a diversified, sustainable middle-income economy in
the coming years. Driven by the new o i l boom, per capita income rose to US$1,240 in 2005, up
from a post-independence l o w ofjust US$470 in 1995.
3. Azerbaijan’s national income will be rising substantially over the next several years, as
new o i l production comes o n stream and international o i l prices are higher. A significant part
o f this income will be leaving the country, however, in the form o f repatriation o f capital and
profits by foreign investors. Moreover, the revenue boom is expected to be relatively short
lived, peaking in about 2010 and declining steadily thereafter.

4. Azerbaijan’s challenge i s to use its o i l revenues to stimulate sustainable broad-based
growth and ensure the welfare o f current and future generations. The economic transition has
been complicated by the armed conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, which led to
nearly 700,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and some 250,000 refugees from Armenia,
loss o f control over some 20 percent o f the land area, and disruption o f key regional trade and
transport links.’ Over the last CAS period, IDA helped the government establish a meaningful
poverty-reduction strategy and supported implementation o f important reforms in many
sectors. I F C helped finance the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and upstream o i l platform
development. Azerbaijan now needs to persevere with key reforms and build o n the
opportunities provided by its o i l revenue. Doing so involves raising the level o f development

Azerbaijan since 1990.

o f rural, mainly agricultural, regions and secondary cities relative to the capital area and
providing equitable basic infrastructure services across the country.

5. The CPS supports the main objective o f the government long-term program to reduce
poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by supporting continued
high non-oil sector growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability; improving health,
education, and infrastructure services; better targeting social protection; improving gender
equality; and achieving environmental sustainability.
6. IBRD financing will support a larger development agenda than did the previous CAS,
particularly in regard to managing and implementing essential infrastructure projects and
environmental remediation. IDA financing will play a critical role in helping the government
improve social and rural conditions and support continued structural reforms. IFC i s partnering
with the private sector to encourage the continued development o f the non-oil economy.
Examples include the development o f the Supplier Finance Facility for S M E suppliers,
corporate governance and leasing TA and potential investments in financial as w e l l as the food
retail sectors. Knowledge-sharing, analytical and advisory activities (AAA), and development
partnerships will reinforce investments. In all areas, the Bank Group’s support will focus on
improving governance, both public and corporate.

billion, o f which about US$20 billion will accrue to the state budget in the form o f corporate
tax revenues and US$l55 billion will accrue to the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) in the form o f
royalties. The o i l consortia are expected to rapidly repatriate some US$40 billion o f invested
capital, plus profits. Roughly speaking, this implies an annual o i l windfall o f US$l,OOO per

the context o f the continuing transition from a post-soviet deteriorated command economy to a
modem market economy, while avoiding the competitiveness pressures o f Dutch disease and
the “resource curse” i s a central challenge confronting Azerbaijan.2

b.

Reducing Poverty

8. Poverty in Azerbaijan i s declining rapidly, particularly in Baku (table 1). At the national
level, the proportion o f poor people fell from about 44.6 percent in 2002 to 24.0 percent in
2005, a drop o f 20.6 percentage points. Extreme poverty fell from 26.9 percent o f the
population in 2002 to 9.2 percent in 2005. These findings suggest that 1.9 million people lived
in poverty in 2005, down from almost 3.3 million in 2002.

9. Reasons for the sharp drop in poverty are two-fold. Wages and salaries have more than
doubled, with the minimum wage raised fivefold since 2001, albeit from a very l o w level.
There has also been a significant surge in transfer incomes for poorer households. Government
social transfers to the poorest 20 percent o f households increased more than 35 percent in
2004, while pensions, the main component o f the government social program, increased about
44 percent. Remittances from a significant number o f Azerbaijanis working abroad are also an
important source o f households financing and has helped reduce poverty.
10. Systemic reforms to improve the targeting and administration o f social assistance and
modernize the pension and social insurance system are well underway. A new targeted social
assistance scheme was rolled out in July 2006. Its impact n o w needs to be carefully monitored.

11. Most improvements in welfare have been concentrated in Baku, which saw a 26.8
percentage points decline in poverty during 2002-05 (poverty fell 21.5 percentage points in
urban areas outside Baku, and 16.8 percentage points in rural areas). Lack o f employment,
assets, and commercial opportunities and weaker access to basic health and education services
in provincial towns and rural areas are driving factors behind intense rural-urban migration.
Lack o f reliable electricity and other infrastructure has been a major factor discouraging
investment and commercial activity outside Baku. Nevertheless, between 2004 and 2005
poverty in non-Baku urban areas fell by 8.2 percentage points, almost twice as much as in

* The potential negative effects o f an inadequately managed natural resource b o o m are often referred t o as Dutch

disease. They include: (i)
macroeconomic adjustment problems stemming f r o m large foreign exchange inflows;
(ii)
unbalanced growth, leading t o crowding out o f the non-petroleum traded goods sector; (iii)
waste o f petroleum
wealth through unproductive public expenditures; and (iv) in some cases accumulation o f external debt as the
resource b o o m increases the capacity t o borrow.

Baku. W h i l e poverty prevalence i s not significantly higher among refugees and internally
displaced people, these groups are particularly vulnerable, because they lack assets and
employment opportunities and are heavily dependent o n state transfer^.^
12. The growth-incidence curve below suggests that growth has been considerably pro-poor in
Azerbaijan during 2002-2005 (figure 2). Growth was positive for all percentiles o f the Azeri
population with a mean annual growth rate in consumption o f 7-8 percent. The poorest decile
has enjoyed annual consumption growth o f about 15 percent. In general, consumption growth
for the poorer deciles i s higher than for the richer deciles.

Improving Social Conditions and Meeting the Millennium
Development Goals

13. Challenges remain in the social sectors. Reforms are underway to address inefficient use o f
resources; weak management, planning, and monitoring capacity at the central and local levels;
and difficulty in adapting the educational system to the changing skills requirements o f the
labor market, but progress has been slow.
14. The education budget has been increased substantially, to 5 percent o f non-oil GDP and
17.8 percent o f the total budget in 2005. The enrollment rate for compulsory education i s high,
and the literacy rate i s almost 100 percent, irrespective o f gender and ethnicity. Beyond age 16,
however, enrollment rates drop sharply, with only 13 percent o f young adults age 17-24 (9
percent among children from poor families) enrolled in postsecondary educational institutions.
Growing inequities in access to education has become an issue. Considerable efforts are
needed to foster a globally competitive knowledge economy based o n a modem curriculum;
higher education brought to international standards; and vocational and adult
educatiodretraining that meets the demands o f a modem market economy. The government
recently appointed an Education Commission to accelerate progress. The Bank i s supporting
the government’s efforts through an education adaptable program loan (APL),and plans to step
up the engagement during the CPS period.
While the dynamics and magnitude o f poverty reduction are not questionable, two factors may modify these
results: underreporting on the poorest groups and under-evaluation o f CPI.

4

15. A fundamental reform agenda needs to be implemented in the healthcare system. L i f e
expectancy at birth in Azerbaijan - already l o w - has been declining, as a result o f high infant,
child, and maternal mortality rates, the high prevalence o f noncommunicable diseases, and
unhealthy lifestyle choices. The healthcare system does not deliver affordable, good-quality
services to meet the needs o f the population, and it suffers from very l o w utilization rates,
particularly among the poor. The sector i s undermined by major inequalities in healthcare;
underfunded, poorly managed, and highly fragmented primary healthcare services; inadequate
and inefficient resource allocation (the sector received just 1.6 percent o f non-oil GDP in
2005); a healthcare workforce that relies o n informal payments to cope with l o w wages and
lacks incentives to provide appropriate care; and a weak governance, legal, and regulatory
environment. Recent changes at the Ministry o f Health provide an opportunity for moving
forward on well-identified and highly needed reforms supported by the sectorwide FY06
Health Sector Reform project.
16. These challenges notwithstanding, the 2005 Millennium Progress Report ranks Azerbaijan
as one o f the countries that can be placed on the “fast track” for achieving the M D G s (see
annex 4). The SPPRED and the SPPRSD are closely aligned with the MDGs. While both
health and education were previously severely underfunded, since 2005 the government has
committed a larger share o f the fast rising budget to the social sectors. Given committed
resources, the key is to move rapidly on needed structural reforms within the social sectors.
The CPS will play an important role in this respect.

d.

Improving Governance

17. Azerbaijan i s going through the turbulent transition from an externally controlled non-free
soviet republic toward more democracy and pluralism. This process takes place in the situation
o f the unsolved international conflict, partial occupation o f the territory, and significant
damage to Azerbaijan’s economy. Against this background, parliamentary elections in
November 2005 showed important progress over previous elections, according to observers
from the Council o f Europe (CoE) and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE), although they did not fully meet international standard^.^ Presidential election
scheduled for 2008 will be an important opportunity for making further progress. Constructive
and independent media and civil society can be allies to the administration by providing a
timely feedback on policies and implementation o f government strategies. As noted elsewhere,
this i s already occurring with respect to the o i l sector, where an active external multistakeholder group participates in the monitoring o f the State Oil Fund. Going forward, a key
challenge for Azerbaijan is that the maturation o f the political system keeps pace with and
supports the rapid economic development. Azerbaijan i s more and more recognized in the postSoviet republics as an important player in international politics able to maintain good relations
with different parties. Azerbaijan holds the chair as Secretary General o f the Organization for
Democracy and Economic Development o f GUAM, whose other members are Georgia,
Ukraine, and Moldova.
18. Progress has been made in some important areas o f governance, particularly in increasing
the transparency o f o i l revenue management. The establishment o f SOFAZ’ and Azerbaijan’s
Re-elections were held in ten precincts, in w h i c h election observers reported irregularities.
The Governance Framework for S O F A Z i s published o n i t s website www.oilfund.az and summarized in the
previous CAS, April 29,2003, Report N o . 25790-AZ, p. 8. To a large extent it follows the Norwegian model, with
a l l Oil Fund expenditures mandated t o b e part o f the consolidated budget approved by Parliament, and executed
through the single Treasury account. Financial reports are disclosed quarterly, and audited reports annually.

participation in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) have resulted in an
upsurge o f activity o f a coalition o f some 90 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
monitoring oil revenues and has expanded opportunities for civil society to engage in dialogue
with the government.6 Azerbaijan has already reported to EITI for the three years 2003, 2004,
and 2005 and i s in accordance with the EITI Memorandum o f Understanding signed in Baku in
November, 2004.7 However, while the State Oil Company (SOCAR) i s participating in EITI,
the government has not yet committed to a firm timetable for SOCAR to be audited to
international standards as required by the international criteria for EITI. Furthermore,
regulatory functions are not separated from commercial ones and restructuring has been slow.
In general, corporate governance and financial accountability o f state-owned enterprises
remain major issues weakening overall fiscal discipline. The CPS i s directly supporting the
E I T I through the Corporate and Public Sector Accounting Project (CAPSAP) and hands-on
support to implementation o f International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in stateowned enterprises according to the new accounting law. Open Society recently commended
Azerbaijan for i t s leadership role in EITI.’
19. Azerbaijan has established an institutional framework to develop and implement a
sustainable fiscal policy. The budget preparation process i s governed by the Budget System
Law drafted in collaboration with the Fund and the Bank. The law introduces multi-year
budgeting through the preparation o f a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to
provide the necessary link with the SPPRED and the public investment program (PIP). Both
the MTEF and the PIP are to be submitted to Parliament. The law ensures that the budget
provides details on expenditure allocations according to international budget classification. All
Oil Fund expenditures (except administrative costs) are included in the annual consolidated
budget approved by Parliament. The improvements in the budget system have been fbrther
enhanced by the introduction o f a single Treasury account and the inclusion o f all previously
extra-budgetary operations o f budget organizations in the budget, including expenditures
financed by SOFAZ. Yet, inter-ministerial coordination needs to be greatly improved. The
MTEF and PIP are not fully developed yet, and require further capacity building at the
Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Economic Development, while the full participation o f
line ministries in the budget formulation process will require extensive training. The CPS i s
supporting the budget formulation process through the Programmatic PER.
20. Less than adequate financial discipline, non-payments, explicit and implicit subsidies, and
instances o f conflict o f interests in the utility and transport sectors constitute serious and
difficult problems facing the economy o f Azerbaijan. The resulting high economic and social
costs are manifested in increasing inefficiencies and consumer losses caused by monopolistic
behavior, frequent systems breakdown, as well as direct impact on health and poverty.
Previously implicit subsidies to energy utilities were in the order o f US$500 million. These
subsidies are now explicitly budgeted for and decreased to about US$320 million in 2005. Yet,
domestic prices on energy products are below international prices, thereby causing a
significant opportunity cost for the sector. The CPS will continue to support the government’s
five-point program set out in the PRSC: moving to cost-recovery tariffs during the CPS period;
The CPS follows the guidance set out in the World Bank Group Management responses to the Extractive
Industries Review.

increasing collections; proper regulation o f natural monopolies; financial accountability
through adoption o f IFRS; and implementing a targeted social safety net to alleviate the impact
on the poor. The government i s strongly committed to the program. In July 2006 President
Aliyev instructed the Cabinet o f Ministers to increase collection rates for public utilities within
three months at all cost. September collection rates had doubled to 83 percent for gas and 70
percent for water.g Meters are rapidly being installed. Tariffs were raised significantly for gas
and water. The new Accounting L a w requires IFRS. The targeted social safety net started July
1,2006.

21. The government recognizes the need for civil service reform, but the pace o f progress has
been slow. L o w salaries, poor organization, and weak motivation have undermined the
performance o f the civil service, despite an educated workforce. The C i v i l Service L a w o f
200 1 i s generally consistent with international standards, but implementation has been slow.
22. Corruption remains a serious problem in Azerbaijan. Despite some improvements in 2005
and in 2006, Azerbaijan still ranks l o w in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions
Index (130 out o f 163 countries in 2006, up from 137 in 2005), and weak governance i s widely
perceived as an obstacle to doing business. Azerbaijan i s ranked 99 in the D o i n g Business 2007
(out o f 175 countries), and five areas need urgent attention: tax rates and administration;
customs; licensing regime; and corruption. The Bank/EBRD Business Environment Enterprise
Perceptions Survey (BEEPS) in 2005 also indicates that weak governance i s widely perceived
as an obstacle to doing business, and that corruption in fact has increased since BEEPS 2002.
Nevertheless, i t should be noted that o f the 2 1 areas o f “Problems Doing Business” surveyed in
BEEPS, Azerbaijan fares better than the E C A average o n 15. In the five areas mentioned above
Azerbaijan i s worse than the average.
23. The comprehensive State Programme on Combating Corruption was developed in
cooperation with civil society and international organizations. The government has undertaken
several initiatives such as passing new anticorruption legislation, strengthening anticorruption
institutions, and creating an anticorruption office in the Prosecutor General’s Office and an
anticomption department in the Ministry o f Interior. The use o f ATM cards for pension
payments has reduced leakage. Improvement also appears to have occurred in the traffic
police, where salaries increased fivefold recently and petty harassment seems to have subsided.
24. The Group o f States against Corruption (GRECO) under the Council o f Europe published
its Evaluation Report on Azerbaijan in June 2006. The report commends the progress made on
the Programme in adopting new legislation, but identifies several shortcomings in
implementation, including limited cooperation and coordination by the various authorities, the
need to broaden the adoption o f a code o f ethics to all public employees, address conflicts o f
interests, and strengthen liability o f legal persons for corruption offences and trading in
influence. The Anti-Corruption Network (ACN) for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, based at
the OECD Secretariat, issued its Monitoring Report, also in June 2006, with detailed
diagnostics and recommendations on speeding up implementation o f the State Programme on
Combating Corruption and other issues.
25. Critical reform to improve the judicial system has started, with support o f IDA. World
Bank Institute governance indicators show steady improvement in government effectiveness
and regulatory quality. The Bank’s comprehensive framework o f reform dialogue with the
9

September 2006 collection rates for electricity were not available at the time o f printing.

government will continue during the coming CPS period. However, progress is slow and the
govemment, supported by international development institutions, needs to and can do more to
combat corruption. The proposed CPS projects and AAA are designed to collectively comprise
an integrated and comprehensive Governance Action Plan to support these efforts, see the
section below on Governance - a Crosscutting Objective of the CPS. This includes governance
reforms on the sector level. For example, corruption in the health sector is being vigorously
addressed through the Health Sector Reform project. Issues in the education sector are being
addressed through a series o f Education ApLs. The Pension and Social Assistance project is
helping to minimize leakage o f social transfers.

e.

Developing the Non-Oil Private Sector

26. Azerbaijan’s o i l wealth offers significant opportunities to improve the environment for
economic growth and create jobs in the non-oil sector. Azerbaijan offers an educated, low-cost
workforce for a country at i t s income level. In addition to o i l and gas, Azerbaijan’s natural
resource endowment includes lead, zinc, iron, and copper ores and a variety o f building
materials, such as limestone and marble. Within the non-oil sector, agriculture and agroprocessing, manufacturing, transit trade and transport, and services such as communications
are expected to be drivers o f growth. However, complacency, due to the immediate o i l wealth
could slow down the urgency o f necessary reforms in the business environment and hamper
competitiveness o f non-oil sectors.
27. Agro-processing offers good potential for growth and employment creation. At the
moment, only a small number o f firms in Azerbaijan process agricultural produce into highervalue products, such as juices, dehydrated fruits, wine, and jams for local and export markets.
Key issues to be addressed include weak factory conditions, unreliable power supply and other
infrastructure constraints, an unfavorable business environment and significant gaps in
supporting industry (for example, collection networks, postharvest facilities, glass containers,
testing facilities, irrigation infrastructure). Improved transport links, including transit corridors,
are also critical. Even modest savings in time, improvements in quality, and reductions in costs
associated with consignment movements could lead to a significant increase in demand in
target markets, such as CIS countries and Turkey.

28. Growth potential also exists in activities supplying the o i l and gas industry, including basic
equipment and machinery, metalworking, a range o f technical services, transportation services,
food and hospitality services, and upstream chemical and petrochemical industries. Growth in
the o i l and gas industry is also likely to stimulate demand for a range o f value-added
telecommunications and networking services. Challenges include the need to meet strict
international standards, large capital requirements, large average orders, and stringent delivery
requirements, which may be difficult for local producers.
29. Trade flows are likely to increase, as two o f Azerbaijan’s largest and fastest-growing
neighbors - the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan - may j o i n the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in the next year. Azerbaijan has set a target ofjoining the W T O within the next couple
o f years. The European Union’s recent inclusion o f the three Caucasus countries in its
European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) could create closer trade links with Europe. Increasing
purchasing power in the region i s also expected to generate stronger demand for goods and
services and time-sensitive transport services. A key CPS priority i s to enhance the potential
for regional transit cooperation to benefit not just Azerbaijan but the region as a whole as well.
8

30. The long anticipated regional transit corridor has taken o f f with the completion o f the BTC
pipeline, through which a million barrels o f o i l per day will flow from Azerbaijan through
Georgia to Turkey, the Mediterranean, and beyond. The South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) will
provide gas to the cross-Turkey system from the large Shah-Deniz field. These mega-projects
provide a major transit source and build confidence in cooperation with South Caucasus
countries. Improving the road and rail links are logical next steps now underway.
3 1. Regarding the financial sector, Azerbaijan's banking system remains quite small relative to
the size o f the economy. Presently 44 banks operate in the country, o f which 18 have foreign
participation and 2 are branches o f foreign banks. Many o f these banks have received support
from IFC and EBRD, and their performance and the range o f services they provide is gradually
improving. However, total banking system assets was s t i l l only about 18 percent o f GDP at the
end o f 2005-a much lower ratio than the 30-40 percent o f GDP in most transition economies
in Central Europe. Following the joint IMF-Bank FSAP in 2004, new central bank and banking
laws have been enacted. They are broadly consistent with Basle principles, and dejure provide
for central bank independence and accountability. The report also made several
recommendations regarding the International Bank o f Azerbaijan (IBA), the country's largest
and s t i l l state-owned bank. IBA presently accounts for about 49 percent o f total banking
system assets, down from 53 percent at the time o f the FSAP. While this is a positive
development, largely reflecting growth o f other (mainly private) banks, the dominant presence
o f one large state bank should be further reduced over time by effectively opening the banking
sector to foreign competition by improving the business environment in the sector.
Enforcement o f prudential regulations has improved with technical assistance from donors.
The l o w capitalization and large open foreign exchange position o f IBA makes i t vulnerable to
shocks, particularly credit quality and exchange rate appreciation. The l o w capitalization and
large open foreign exchange positions potentially make the banking sector vulnerable to
shocks, particularly credit quality and exchange rate appreciation. Nevertheless, stress tests
demonstrate high resistance o f the banking sector against macroeconomic shocks. In general,
the banking system should broaden i t s intermediation o f finance to small and medium-size
enterprises and to people in rural areas. Improving access to financial services is a key
challenge to support savings, credit, commercial activity, and j o b creation in rural areas.
32. The unreliability o f electricity and gas supply remains a constraint to business operation
and daily life. One in four f i r m s surveyed in the 2005 BEEPS identified electricity supply as a
problem in doing business, and almost 7 percent o f total annual sales were lost due to power
outages. Some areas o f the country receive only a few hours o f electricity a day, and there are
frequent localized outages and occasional widespread system failures. The gas transmission
system also needs large-scale rehabilitation, and gas treatment and storage facilities are
inadequate. The sector i s far from financially viable. Azerenerji, the state electricity company,
depends heavily on SOCAR to provide power plant fuel but lacks the ability to pay for it.
Azerigas, the state gas company, i s in a similar situation. Explicit subsidies are provided from
the state to cover SOCAR deliveries in both cases.

J:

Cleaning up the Environment

33. 130 years o f o i l production on the Absheron Peninsula around Baku has l e f i some 33,000
hectares o f oil-contaminated lands. The Caspian Sea i s also affected. The bulk o f the pollution
was created by Soviet era companies that no longer exist, but the pollution has also continued
since SOCAR took over in 1991. Examples o f poor practice include o i l and waste water
spilling pouring out onto the ground at drilling sites. Some o f the contaminated sites are very
9

near Baku, and citizens and developers are building homes and apartments on them. This
represents a serious health risk and could potentially cause catastrophic fire or explosion.
34. Recently the President has ordered the urgent clean-up o f the o i l contaminated land. A
substantial portion o f the estimated 700 million barrels o f o i l o n these lands may be
recoverable, and represents a very substantial value. A significant part o f the contaminated
land also has high potential value for residential and commercial development once it i s
cleaned up. Issues, however, remain concerning ownership o f the contaminated land.
Furthermore, efforts are required to ensure that all existing o i l operations conform to good
international environmental and safety practice.
35. Venting o f gas into the air i s taking place from older fields in the Caspian. From one field
alone about 1 million cubic meters o f associated gas is vented into the air daily from wells not
equipped with flaring equipment or capacity to pipe the gas. I t i s expected that this figure may
rise to 3 million cubic meters unless new piping and compressor investments are made. This
represents an opportunity for Carbon Financing.
36. The Baku sanitation system i s in urgent need o f reconstruction. Here, and in several other
places untreated residential and industrial wastewater i s contaminating rivers and the Caspian
Sea. Again, this has led to heightened health hazards. Furthermore, the sturgeon population is
under pressure.
37. Azerbaijan’s high biodiversity results from i t s location at the convergence o f three
biogeographic regions (Europe, Central Asia and Asia Minor). The Caucasus mountains area,
has been identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as a Global 200 Ecoregion,
and by Conservation International as one o f the world’s 25 biodiversity “hotspots” (the only
one in the E C A region). The Caucasus ecosystem profile identified deforestation, overgrazing
and hunting as the three greatest direct threats to biodiversity. Underlying causes include
poverty in rural areas, the end o f importation o f wood from other countries, the collapse o f
natural gas supply systems, political insecurity and the presence o f large numbers o f internally
displaced people. With support o f the Bank the government i s improving natural resource
management and introducing more sustainable economic activities in two mountainous areas
o f Azerbaijan, in order to enhance the ecological quality and the sustainable productivity o f
high elevation forests and pastures.
38. Azerbaijan is located in an area o f high seismic activity. The country i s also susceptible to
heavy flooding because o f i t s topography and the water-level fluctuation o f the Caspian Sea.
Landslides are a high risk during periods o f increased precipitation, causing significant damage
to human settlements, industry, farms, and roads. The probability o f annual economic losses
exceeding $1.4 billion is about 0.5 percent. The probability o f annual losses exceeding $90
million i s estimated at about 5 percent.”

Recent Developments

39. Azerbaijan's economy has grown rapidly since the late 1990s, particularly in the non-oil
sectors (table 2)." In the past five years, the non-oil economy has outperformed the o i l sector,
growing at an average annual rate o f 12 percent. The non-oil sector currently accounts for 60
percent o f GDP and 99 percent o f employment. Since 1995 output in the agricultural,
commercial, and social sectors has roughly doubled, non-oil industrial output has tripled,
output in transport and communication has quadrupled, and construction has increased by a
factor o f 1 3 . ' ~

fully financed by FDI
from international o i l consortia, and the overall balance o f payments recorded a surplus. In
2005 the current account turned into a small surplus (1.3 percent o f GDP), as the B T C was
largely completed and high o i l prices drove up export earnings. Net FDI inflows peaking at
32 percent o f GDP in 2003 declined to around 4 percent in 2005 and are projected to turn
into large net outflows in 2006-09, as capital repatriation from the o i l and gas investments
begins.

41. From unsustainably high levels in the early 1990s, the consolidated government deficit
without Oil Fund net revenues declined to less than 2 percent o f GDP in 2001.13 However,

fiscal adjustment in the 1990s required deep expenditure cuts, especially in the social sectors,

which has led to suboptimal health care and education services. With the 2005 budget the
government has started to allocate more adequate resources to the social sectors.
42. To avoid Dutch disease, in 1999 the government established SOFAZ as the main
sterilization mechanism for foreign exchange inflows. The government has remained
committed to exercising caution over the use o f the expected o i l and gas windfall and to
ensuring that it benefits all citizens and future generations.
43. Early 2005 saw an upsurge in inflation (12.5 percent in March 2005, on a year-to-year
basis), in part due to higher levels o f public spending but also as state-owned enterprises that
benefit from higher o i l revenues (SOCAR) and access to credit increased spending. A
temporary rise in food prices also increased inflation, and the policy o f fixing the manat to the
U.S. dollar resulted in an expansion o f the monetary base. The National Bank’s response has
been to allow the manat to appreciate by about 10 percent in nominal effective terms and raise
the refinancing rate. The Ministry o f Finance increased the issuance o f T-bills to absorb
liquidity. Inflation returned to single digits by fall 2005, and was 10.3 percent in September
2006 on a year-to-year basis.

b.

Medium-Term Outlook

44. Azerbaijan’s medium-term growth prospects are strong. Real GDP i s projected to grow at
an average annual rate o f about 24 percent between 2006 and 2008, due to continued rapid
growth in the o i l and non-oil sectors (table 3). The decline in oil-related investments i s counter
balanced by the government’s intensive efforts to rebuild the country’s infrastructure and
human capital to catch up with more than a decade o f deterioration. However, competitiveness
o f the non-oil sector i s likely to be challenged by an appreciating real effective exchange rate
due to higher o i l revenues and rapid monetary expansion as a result o f the fiscal stance.
45. The 2006 budget contains a major fiscal expansion. While nominal GDP i s expected to
grow at 42 percent, current expenditures are budgeted to increase over 60 percent, and the
public investment budget is planned to triple. The non-oil primary deficit is expected to
increase from 11 percent o f non-oil GDP in 2005 to over 30 percent in 2006.
46. The IMF and the Bank have expressed concern that this rate o f public expenditure increase
may cause new inflationary pressures. The authorities counter that over the past years,
Azerbaijan’s economy has been able to absorb FDI o f more than 30 percent o f GDP a year in
connection with the BTC, the South Caucasus Pipeline, and upstream o i l development. As
these investments end, the government i s gearing up for its own large infrastructure
investments. The authorities are well aware o f the inflation risks and would slow the rate o f
infrastructure investment and consider other offsetting measures if inflation gets too high. The
government is also fully aware that constraints to institutional and absorptive capacity may
slow the execution o f the large investment program.
47. During 2007-08 government spending i s projected to increase by about 35 percent p.a. (in
nominal terms) as the reconstruction agenda continues. l4Elections are scheduled for 2008.
From 2009 it i s projected that the rise in spending will slow down to about 10 percent p.a. The
14

Based on estimates from the Bank’s sector experts, the projections assume that the reconstruction cost would be
in the order of US$20-30 billion in total spread over 6-10 years. This figure should be seen in comparison with
projected government revenues from o i l and gas of US$175 billion during 2006-2024, as noted above.

12

non-oil fiscal deficit i s expected to peak at over 40 percent in 2007-08 and steadily decline
thereafter. Such a government strategy would be fiscally sustainable with today’s o i l prices. I t
would result in Oil Fund assets reaching about US$35 billion in 2010. However, the current
strategy contains substantial risks o f over-heating the non-oil economy, and as experience in
other countries shows, the risks o f Dutch disease and the “resource curse” are substantial.
Inflation i s expected to rise t o about 17 percent p.a. in 2007-08, before falling back to the ten
percent range.

48. Mitigating these risks requires aggressive pursuit o f structural reforms, which would
unleash domestic resources, reduce operating costs, and increase productivity, to counter the
adverse impact o f the appreciating real effective exchange rate (REER), see box 1. However,
these structural reforms and rebuilding a competitive infrastructure will take some time t o have
effect. In the short-term the pressures o n non-oil competitiveness are mitigated by the fact that

the real effective exchange rate has depreciated considerably against other countries since
1995, and that wages are relatively l o w in international comparison (see box 1). Yet, the tradeo f f made by the government o f temporarily increasing public investment at the cost o f higher
inflation may lead to suboptimal private sector expenditure behavior formed by expectations o f
continued domestic inflation. Azerbaijan’s experience suggests that monetary policy m a y not
be sufficient to offset the impact o f fundamentals o n the REER dynamics in the medium term.
Therefore the appreciation o f the REER can likely not be avoided in any event. Nominal
exchange rate appreciation can counteract inflation and these expectations. Both domestic
inflation and exchange rate appreciation would lead to a capital loss in domestic currency o n
accumulated resource revenues denominated in U S dollars.

49. High inflation has been shown to have a negative impact o n resource allocation, investment

incentives, trade, financial intermediation, and, as a result, economic growth. I t i s potentially
more costly than the short-term repercussions o n exporters and foreign currency deposit
holders related to nominal exchange rate adjustments. Moreover, lower income segments o f
society likely suffer disproportionally from high inflation. Greater exchange rate flexibility
could also support financial market development and discourage purely speculative inflows.
However, although nominal exchange rate appreciation could help reduce inflation pressures,
prudent macroeconomic and structural policies will be essential. Fiscal restraint by phasing the
implementation o f the public investment program remains an important instrument for curbing

13

the inflationary impact of excessive domestic demand. It should be accompanied by a prudent
monetary policy framework, geared toward containing upward pressures o n the real exchange
rate. The main sterilization instrument will continue to be the Oil Fund and restraint on its
financing o f non-oil deficits.

50. During 2006-07 about a quarter o f gross national income (GNI) is expected to leave the
country, as foreign investors repatriate capital. While GDP is expected to almost triple in U S
dollar terms between 2005 and 2009, the production-sharing agreements with the o i l
consortium call for accelerated capital repatriation when o i l prices are higher. Foreign
investors are projected to repatriate about US$8.2 billion in 2006, about the size o f GDP in
14

2004. Adjusted for capital repatriation, per capita GNI in 2005 was US$920 and is projected to
be US$1,140 in 2006 and US$1,690 in 2007. The CPS takes account o f repatriation in its
transition planning for the phasing out o f IDA support to Azerbaijan.

c.

Debt Sustainability

5 1. Azerbaijan’s external debt, about 50 percent o f which i s o n concessional terms, i s expected
to remain sustainable. External debt, at about 15 percent o f GDP, and debt service obligations,
at 2.6 percent o f exports o f goods and services in 2005, are moderate (DRS data). Both ratios
are expected to decline further. IDA total debt outstanding from Azerbaijan i s US$525 million,
with a debt service to export ratio o f 0.1 percent. IDA debt service represented 4.9 percent o f
total public debt service in 2005 and i s expected to increase to 7.3 percent by 2008. In
November 2005 Fitch increased its sovereign rating for Azerbaijan o n long-term liabilities in
both foreign and national currencies from BB- to BB. The rating on short-term foreign
currency remained unchanged at B. The long-term rating forecast i s “stable.” Moody’s
assigned Azerbaijan a foreign and local currency issuer rating o f B a l in September 2006.

IV. T h e Government’s Strategy for Reducing Poverty
a.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2003-05)

52. The SPPRED recognized the role o f the private sector as crucial to sustaining development
and strengthening public social service delivery. Key strategies for reducing poverty and
increasing living standards included improving public expenditure management and
strengthening the financial and utility sectors.
53. The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), presented to the Board in May 2003, concluded that the
SPPRED presented a credible poverty reduction strategy and provided a sound basis for Bank
and Fund concessional assistance. I t noted, however, that poor governance and weak
implementation capacities were bottlenecks.
54. The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the second Annual Progress Report found
continuing evidence o f poverty reduction and strong real growth performance. I t also noted
other areas that require continued attention, such as strengthening poverty diagnostics,
enhancing coordination o f macroeconomic policies and reducing inflation to single digits,
improving the fimding and effectiveness o f social services, reducing energy subsidies,
reforming customs, deepening financial intermediation, improving governance, and addressing
the barriers to private sector development, including underdeveloped infrastructure.

b,
The State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable
Development (2006-15)

5 5 . The SPPRSD will continue to pursue similar strategic goals: ensuring economic growth
and maintaining macroeconomic stability; creating enabling conditions to improve incomegeneration opportunities, especially in the non-oil sector, in the regions, and in rural areas;
improving the quality o f and ensuring equal access to basic health and education services;
improving public administration and good governance; improving public infrastructure;
reforming the social protection system to better protect vulnerable groups, especially children;
improving the live conditions o f refugees and internally displaced people; ensuring that
government policies and programs in all sectors promote and protect gender equality; and
ensuring that all economic development policies, programs, and related legislation respect the
principles o f environmental sustainability.
15

56. The SPPRSD is aligned with the MDGs and with other programs in Azerbaijan. I t sets both
general and specific targets. I t is intended to be integrated with the Medium-Term Economic
Framework (MTEF), Public Investment Program (PIP) and State budget processes. I t is based
on a broad participatory process involving the government, international organizations, and
civil society. I t provides for a system o f monitoring the implementation and impact o f the
measures on living standards, and i t incorporates gender, youth policy, environmental, and
other cross-cutting issues.

FY03-06: T r a c k Record and Lessons L e a r n e d

Achievements of the FYO3-05 CAS and Remaining Challenges

57. The experience in Azerbaijan over the past few years generally has been positive. The
Bank worked with the government to establish a meaningful poverty reduction strategy and,
based o n this, provided adjustment credits to support the government in implementing
significant reform in individual sectors. The Bank Group strategy to support the SPPRED was
organized into four strategic goals: (i)
manage the o i l boom to maintain macroeconomic
stability, avoid “Dutch disease” and facilitate non-oil growth, employment and pro-poor
expenditures; (ii)
generate jobs and non-oil growth by improving the business environment and
access to financial services, building S M E support infrastructure, and stimulating agriculture;
(iii)
improve infrastructure and social services by reversing the decline in social services and
assistance and developing energy, transport, and water infrastructure; and (iv) help realize the
o i l potential to the extent and within the time-frame the SPPRED presumes.
58. The CAS period saw substantial progress in all four strategic directions. Particularly strong
results were seen in the first and fourth pillars: managing the o i l boom and helping realize the
o i l potential. GDP grew on average 11 percent per year over the past four years with non-oil
GDP growing at 13 percent a year; the B T C pipeline was completed; development o f gas fields
and other pipelines are o n schedule; the Oil Fund i s firmly in place, the budgetary framework
i s being implemented, and the government’s commitment to maintaining high standards o f
governance and transparency in the utilization o f its energy revenues was demonstrated by its
groundbreaking participation in the EITI, as the first and only country in the world reporting
for 2003 and 2004. However, progress on SOCAR restructuring has been slow.

59. Good progress was also made toward the second goal, although progress was slower in
some important areas. Sustained growth was seen in the non-oil sector and progress was made
in most areas supported by the Bank, including the financial sector, land market, rural credit,

irrigation, and environment. However, considerable work remains to be done to improve the
business environment, competition in the banking sector, and eliminate corruption. Progress
on privatization and improving the transparency o f state owned enterprises has been slow.

60. In the social sectors, IDA had significant impact through the dialogue o n pension and
social assistance and comprehensive reforms are underway. The government also strengthened
its care to IDPs and began seeking sustainable solutions to improving their living conditions
and economic opportunities. In the education sector, progress was made in developing new
cumcula, provision o f free textbooks, and monitoring education outcomes. Restructuring
continued in the water and energy sectors, although limited progress was made on increasing
private sector involvement. The health sector remained an area o f serious concern, but time
was well spent on completing a Health Sector Review. The change in the ministerial leadership
16

in 2005 made it possible to move rapidly forward with a major and well-researched Health

Sector Reform Project.

The FY06 Program

c.

Current Portfolio Status

62. The objectives o f the CAS were successfully continued during FY06, despite Parliamentary
elections in the fall o f 2005 that brought new ministers to the ministries o f finance, economic
development, health, and agriculture. The Bank supported major intensification o f governance
reform with the new Judicial Reform Project (SDR14.8 million [US$21.6 million]) and the
new Health Sector Reform Project (SDR34.3 million [US$50 million]). The second phase o f
the Agricultural Development and Credit APL (SDR20.1 million [US$29.2 million]) was also
negotiated, and all three projects were presented to the Executive Board in June 2006.
Furthermore, Azerbaijan i s now rapidly moving to IBRD status with the Highway-I1 Project o f
US$200 million approved in January 2006. F Y 0 6 also saw additional financing o f SDR3.5
million (US$5 million) for the Rehabilitation and Completion o f Irrigation and Drainage
Infrastructure Project and the restructuring o f some undisbursed funds o f IBTA-2 for avian flu
emergency purposes. I F C invested US$13.3 million in four projects in financial markets to
support leasing and financial intermediation to medium, small and micro-enterprises (SMEs).
O n the technical assistance side IFC PEP-Central Asia continued working on developing the
expansion o f leasing and housing finance as w e l l as helping local banks and companies build
capacity through its corporate governance project. I F C also continued working with BP on
supporting local suppliers through the ACG/BTC SME linkage program.

63. The current IDNIBRD portfolio consists o f 18 projects (16 IDA plus two IBRD). T o date
total commitments are about US$940 million, o f which US$423 million remains undisbursed.
Eight ongoing infrastructure projects are designed to enhance economic growth. These include
17

major commitments to rural development, irrigation, water supply, and the highway sector.
These commitments will be continued through new operations that will come on board as the
current ones expire during the new CPS period. The Bank has also entered into its first IBRD
project in power transmission, which will continue for the l i f e o f the new CPS. As o f June
2006, I F C committed portfolio i s US$49 million and outstanding portfolio i s US$41 million.
The portfolio is mostly in the B T C project (63 percent) and financial markets (34 percent),
specifically in four local financial institutions.
64. In the social sectors, the Bank i s currently providing support for an education APL, a next
phase o f which is expected in the new CPS. The Health Reform LIL closed this year and i s
followed o n by a sector-wide approach. IDA i s also supporting pensions and social assistance
reform as well as raising the living standards o f internally displaced people through ongoing
proj ects.
65. Generically, there are few problems with project performance and the average FY05-06
disbursement ratio was about 20 percent. The 2005 Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) stressed the importance o f strong supervision o f TA activities, and o f increased
attention to project processing to avoid delays.

VI. The Country Partnership Strategy, FY07-10
66. The main thrust o f the earlier agenda was helping the government manage and use i t s oil
revenues. The new challenge for the government i s to build on the opportunities provided by
this revenue to establish a diversified market economy. The CPS is designed to help mitigate
the current risks o f Dutch disease and the “resource curse.’’ The Bank will help ensure that o i l
revenues are used wisely, that institutional and policy reform i s undertaken, and that
appropriate capacity building and fiduciary oversight are provided.
67. The objective o f sustainable and balanced growth involves integrating rural regions and
secondary cities with the capital area and securing equitable basic service standards, such as
electricity, gas and water supply, and easy access to markets across the country. It also requires
regional integration o f markets across the South Caucasus, the Caspian, and the Black Sea
area. Human development will be a critical element in helping build a competitive diversified
economy. Maintaining a clean environment and ensuring prudent use o f natural resources i s
also essential to ensure sustainable growth and to improve health outcomes.
68. Strengthening governance i s a key element o f this agenda and a crosscutting, high-priority
objective o f the CPS. The new strategy will improve public sector management and support
judicial reform; strengthen the system o f checks and balances, external and internal audit
functions, and institutions supervising financial markets; and increase local participation and
community empowerment.
69. The CPS will support four main pillars (figure 3):

>

Pillar I:Improving the quality and transparency in public sector governance, by
maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework that makes prudent use o f o i l
revenues; improving public expenditure planning and management; strengthening
financial management and procurement systems; establishing proper public sector and
corporate governance, accounting, and auditing; creating an administrative and

18

regulatory business environment conducive to growth; and strengthening the judicial
system.
Pillar 11: Supporting sustainable and balanced growth of the non-oil economy, by
expanding access to financial services; supporting the development o f SMEs and
investing directly in the private sector; developing rural infrastructure and services;
improving the quality o f and access to roads and other transit routes; improving the
quality and coverage o f water and sanitation nationwide; increasing the reliability o f
electricity and gas supply; and strengthening the financial viability o f the utility sectors.
Pillar 111: Increasing the quality of and access to social services, by expanding
coverage o f good-quality health care services; developing a modern and globally
competitive education system; effectively targeting social assistance; creating a more
transparent, affordable, and sustainable pension system; and improving living
conditions and economic opportunities for internally displaced people.
Pillar IV: Improving environmental management, by cleaning up legacy pollution,
reducing carbon emissions, promoting biodiversity, supporting more sustainable natural
resource management in selected areas, and strengthening natural disaster management.

70. The government and the Bank will continue to implement the reform framework laid out in
the PRSC. Although early in the CPS consultation process, the decision was made to
discontinue the second and third PRSC operations, as there i s little rationale for providing
general budgetary or balance o f payments support given the rapid inflow o f o i l revenues, the
government has nevertheless affirmed its commitment to the PRSC agenda, which remains the
underlying policy framework for the CPS, as summarized in the Results Matrix (annex 1).
From a practical standpoint, the CPS selectively supports the implementation o f the reform
agenda through a combination o f the programmatic AAA and reform components o f the
various investment projects. Table 5 summarizes the reform areas o f the PRSC and the main
CPS instruments that support their continued implementation. The CPS interventions also form
a comprehensive and coherent governance action plan, which i s described in section g below.

Pillar I:Improving the Quality and Transparency in Public Sector
a.
Governance
71. Weaknesses in basic public service delivery stemming from governance problems and
institutional capacity constraints remain important impediments to sustainable development
and poverty reduction in Azerbaijan. Addressing these weaknesses i s a k e y medium-term
objective o f the government’s public sector reform program and an important strategic goal o f
the CPS.
Maintaining a Stable Macroeconomic Framework

72. Macroeconomic management to date has been prudent, preventing Dutch disease.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability during the current investment boom and imminent spike
in o i l revenues remains a challenge. The IMF will continue to assist the authorities in
macroeconomic management through close policy dialogue in the context o f Article I V
consultations and TA. The Fund will take the lead o n exchange rate and monetary policy
advice. The Bank will support macroeconomic management in the medium term and develop
long-term projections for sustainable fiscal and monetary policies under alternative o i l price
trajectories through just-in-time policy papers and a Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM). A two-sector RMSM-X, an elaborate Oil Model, the IMF Financial Programming
Model, and monthly time series-based early warning systems will be used to monitor the
macroeconomic situation.
Improving Public Expenditure Planning and Management

73. The Programmatic Public Expenditure Review (PPER) will support efficient and
transparent budgeting and fiduciary arrangement, starting with the state consolidated budget
and SOFAZ. Informed strategic priority setting and vertical as well as horizontal accountability
to Parliament and civil society i s at the core o f good governance. Appropriate governance
frameworks were established under the previous CAS. They now need to be fully implemented
and used.
74. With IDA assistance, the government has established the MTEF and PIP for the budget
formulation process. As in other countries, it will take some years to build the capacity to bring
these strategic exercises to sufficient quality. During the CPS period, technical assistance and
the PPER will support the M T E F and PIP mechanisms to secure financing for priority needs
while strengthening the linkage between policy objectives set in the SPPRSD and the annual
public expenditure programs. With these mechanisms, the government aims to strengthen the
coordinating framework for all ministries to operate within a strategically prioritized
expenditure framework and a predictable resource envelope. The budget calendar, as stipulated
in the Budget Systems Law, entails a much stronger participatory process that includes line
ministries and other budgetary organizations. The regulations related to the Budget Systems
L a w have been adopted, and budget process manuals will be approved. Considerable training
will also be undertaken in the Ministry o f Finance and other line ministries. The Bank will
work closely with U S A I D through its Public Investment Policy and Efficiency project and with
the US. Treasury budget advisor. Results o f these interventions will be monitored within the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) self-assessment framework
21

75. The Chamber o f Accounts was established and initial capacity building provided under the
previous CAS. Under the CPS, a twinning arrangement will be sought to help the Chamber o f
Accounts conduct audits o f public institutions and connect o n line to the new computerized
Treasury Information Management System (TIMS), which should be h l l y functioning in
2007. l5The capacity to conduct transparent procurement processes will be h r t h e r strengthened
through an e-procurement grant from the Institutional Development Fund (IDF). Results will
be monitored using the Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) framework and the CPAR
Update.
Strengthening Governance Mechanisms and Increasing Financial Transparency

76. To promote good governance in the financial and the corporate sectors, including stateowned enterprises, the CPS will focus on enabling high-quality financial reporting and
accounting and auditing standards through adoption o f IFRS and International Standards on
Auditing (ISA). Supported by IDA, Technical Aid to the Commonwealth o f Independent States
(TACIS), and other donors, the government has enacted a new accounting law and started
drafting related secondary legislation. l6CAPSAP will also support the transition o f corporate
financial reporting to international standards, as stipulated in the law, including the hiring o f
accounting companies and installation o f systems such that major state-owned enterprises can
comply with these standards. SOCAR i s now training the accountants who will implement
IFRS and eventually make it possible for SOCAR to have auditing and disclosure to
international standards. The Bank is supporting this important transformation and training
programs over the next several years, which will also support EITI. Results o f this program
will be monitored through the C F A A Update and Reviews o f Standards and Codes (ROSCs)
on corporate governance, accounting and auditing l7 . Furthermore, IFC Corporate
Governance Project will continue to provide in-depth technical assistance to Azerbaijan’s
joint-stock companies and banks that are interested improving their corporate governance
practices.
In addition to the general introduction o f international best practice corporate
governance standards to banks and joint-stock companies, the project will also assist
government agencies to improve corporate governance legislation and regulatory framework.

This legislation mandates the use o f pure IFRS by public interest entities (defined as entities representing a

” The Bank and the IMF are also providing technical assistance t o the Azerbaijan National Bank, which i s in

which i s expected t o be submitted t o Parliament soon, i s broadly consistent with the FATF 40+9. Consistency o f

Azerigazbank and A z e l (Azerbaijan Electronics) have been selected as p i l o t companies. IFC is working closely
with them to revise their corporate documents and improve their governance standards to bring them into line with
worldwide best practice.

22

Reforming Public Administration and the Civil Service

77. A keen interest has developed at the highest levels o f government in quickly making
Azerbaijan a twenty-first century information society. The State Programme on Development
o f Communication and Information Technologies, approved by the President in October 2005,
outlines a wide range o f activities, including e-government. The CPS will support the
modernization o f public sector administrative systems and organization in close alignment with
the state program and the ENP Action Plan.Ig The Bank will support E-Government and
Public Sector Reform activities in areas such as design and implementation o f e-procurement,
systems for personnel and financial management, and public service interfaces. I t may also
support information and communication technology in education and creation o f regional
information training centers; Internet access centers; special economic zones in order to
prevent a digital divide, especially among young people; and development o f the information
and communication technology sector. The Bank’s support would be in the form o f analytical
work, TA, and possibly project implementation. Progress will be monitored within the
framework o f the European Commission, Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
and World Bank Institute (WBI) Governance Indicators.
Strengthening the Judicial System

78. The Judiciary Reform Project is supporting the government’s ongoing reform program to
improve the hnctioning o f the civil, criminal, and economic courts by strengthening the
management capacity o f judicial institutions, upgrading court facilities by building and
rehabilitating courthouses and providing technology and equipment, strengthening the
professionalism o f judges and justice sector staff by providing training and upgrading training
facilities, and improving citizen access to information. The project seeks to have a measurable
impact on a national scale, with special attention to the Baku area, which accounts for about 60
percent o f the caseload, as well as other regions that merit targeted attention. Progress will be
monitored within the overall framework o f Azerbaijan’s Council o f Europe membership and
the Judiciary Reform Project results framework.
Improving the Business Environment

79. Azerbaijan is in the process ofjoining the WTO. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency
(USTDA) i s funding a resident advisor to support this process by helping identify and amend
areas in legislation that need to be changed and ensure that standards, policies, and practices
are in line with WTO mandates. The Bank and F I A S will continue to support this process
through policy dialogue and TA for the WTO-consistent regulatory development, such as new
investment and competition laws.

19

The European Commission i s leading the efforts o n public sector and c i v i l service reform. These reforms will
gain considerable impetus as the E N P A c t i o n Plan moves forward and the vast range o f instruments and
experience f r o m EU accession countries i s activated. Other donors are leading the support to core c i v i l service
reform, such as human resource management and ethics; the CPS focuses o n efficient public service delivery and
transparency.

23

80. I F C with FIAS will continue to help improve the business climate and identify
impediments to foreign investments. Removing administrative and regulatory impediments to
starting and operating businesses remains a high priority objective o f the CPS. The Bank/FIAS
INOTIS report o f FY03 laid out an overall strategic framework and detailed action plans.
F I A S i s currently advising the government on streamlining o f the licensing regime. Another
barrier identified in the Doing Business Report in 2006 was “starting a business” which
reportedly averaged 115 days. Supported by the PRSC, the regulations for registration o f legal
entities were streamlined, and the latest Doing Business in 2007 shows a reduction to 53 days.
The registry will be computerized under the Judicial Reform Project, which will also
strengthen economic courts. The Cadastre and Real Estate Registration Project will support
the establishment o f a nationwide immovable property registration system. This project aims to
make property rights more secure and better allow real estate to be used as collateral for credit.

81. F I A S will continue to conduct in-depth administrative barriers diagnosis, and work with
the government on Doing Business focused and licensing reforms as w e l l as regulatory
governance arenas. I F C is also active through PEP-Central Asia, in strengthening the
corporate governance and building financial intermediaries’ capability. I F C plans to establish
a baseline assessment and progress which will be monitored through the S M E Surveys and
Policy Recommendations. This will further guide CPS policy interventions and the Bank’s
Structural Reform TA program. BEEPS, FIAS and Doing Business surveys will be
conducted regularly to monitor progress o n business environment reforms and will further
guide CPS policy interventions and the Bank’s Structural Reform TA program.

b.

Pillar II:Supporting Sustainable Growth of the Non-Oil Economy

82. Significant investment in infrastructure and transit corridors; continued governance
reforms, particularly in the utility sectors; and greater access to financial services will be
needed to develop Azerbaijan’s non-oil growth potential. Investments will be needed to
support agricultural and other rural commercial activities and help small and medium-size
enterprises market their products in highly competitive markets. The CPS will provide support
in all o f these areas.
Developing the Financial Sector

83. The on-going Financial Sector Technical Assistance (FSTA) established the modem
payment systems infrastructure, introduced international accounting and financial reporting
standards and governance principles in the banking sector, set the basic infrastructure to
facilitate credit risk management and started the infrastructure needed for a widespread use o f
electronic payment instruments. The Financial Services Development Project is improving
payment systems for the utility bills collection, and access to financial services and basic
business infrastructure in smaller urban and rural areas through the postal system. Better
financial infrastructure and access will facilitate other government reforms, such as taxes,
pensions and social assistance and the postal offices infrastructure will enable the provision o f
e-government services to citizens and businesses, including those in rural areas.
84. A Financial Sector Modernization Project would support implementation o f the next
phase o f reforms in banking, insurance, and capital markets; further strengthening o f the
24

institutional capacity o f the National Bank o f Azerbaijan; improvement o f financial risk
management institutions (e.g., credit risk register, pledges/movable property register, mortgage
support systems); strengthening o f the insurance sector including o f the regulatory and
supervisory authorities, introduction o f surveillance and monitoring systems, and development
o f infrastructure to improve risk management in the insurance industry; and capital market
reforms focused on improving access to equity capital and facilitating entry o f foreign equity
portfolio investors.
85. I F C has helped establish Azerbaijan’s first microfinance bank, which i s rapidly growing
and branching out. IFC investments and TA will seek to foster a competitive and dynamic
financial market, to develop the non-banking sector, and to help expand the range o f financial
products. I F C will focus on building the capacity o f financial institutions by improving access
to finance to local private banks that serve SMEs and supporting establishment o f leasing
companies. This includes provision o f technical assistance for institutional capacity building as
well as sectonvide technical assistance, such as leasing and housing finance development and
corporate governance. For example, I F C has surveyed and identified gaps in the country’s
housing finance system via PEP-Central Asia and will continue to support the development
o f this sector in Azerbaijan through follow-up TA and investments.
Non-Banking Sector

86. I F C will continue to support the development o f the non-banking sector to increase and
diversify financial intermediations to SMEs. I F C will build on its ongoing TA in the leasing
industry to support expansion o f the industry, including creation o f a transparent and attractive
legal and tax environment for leasing and increased public awareness; and well as hands-on
training in lease origination, underwriting, credit analysis, monitoring and r i s k management.
I F C recently committed US$30 million to a leasing facility for Central Asia (including
Azerbaijan), which i s intended to provide long-term credit lines to local financial institutions
and in partnership with Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, launched a threeyear, $2 million Swiss-funded TA program that aims to increase access to finance and create
employment through the development o f leasing sector. Under this program, recently I F C has
committed loans o f US$8 million to the first leasing transactions by an international
development institution in Azerbaijan.
SME Development

87. IFC will continue to work on improving access to finance for SMEs and building their
competitiveness through i t s activities to deepen the financial markets and its continued
ACG/BTC SME Linkage Program. In order to enable local companies to benefit from
international tenders associated with the o i l field and B T C pipeline operations, IFC partnered
with BP, Statoil and GTZ to pioneer the Linkage Program in 2003. The program delivers
training and access to finance through the Baku Enterprise Centre, an entity that reaches out to
growing small businesses though a variety o f approaches. In 2005 this work led to $68 million
in contracts for local firms. IFC has provided business training to 559 SMEs, increasing these
companies’ sales not only to BP but also to other companies and sector in Azerbaijan. In June
2006 the Access to Finance Pilot project called the Supplier Finance Facility, implemented
through the Micro-Finance Bank o f Azerbaijan provided its first supplier finance loan to a
local BP supplier, Azmetco, a company specializing in metering services. This latter initiative
25

is the first step in an important new effort, which will improve access to finance to
Azerbaijan’s local o i l and gas industry supplier and service enterprises. IFC will also seek to
invest directly in emerging domestic S M E s in general manufacturing sectors. In its constant
effort to improve lending to S M E s I F C is devoting specialized resources to assess this
possibility.
Direct Private Sector Investment

88. I F C will continue to actively seek direct investment opportunities in areas such as food
retail to support growth and employment in the non-oil sectors. I F C will also seek
opportunities to support private sector development to include SOEs privatization and Southto-South investments. For example, I F C i s presently considering supporting the establishment
o f a grocery retail chain in Baku o f about 86 stores. The project will introduce the Azerbaijan
market to organized food retail in a chain format, and middle and lower-middle income
consumers will benefit from the additional convenience, product range, quality and
affordability o f modem grocery retailing. Furthermore, once the government decides o n
bringing in the private sector, I F C will also support the transparent privatization o f SOEs
especially in infrastructure and telecom sectors.
DevelopingRural Infrastructure and Services

89. Rural areas account for 40 percent o f employment in Azerbaijan. Rural development i s
therefore key to supporting sustainable growth in the non-oil sectors and reducing poverty. The
ongoing Agriculture Development and Credit Project (ADCP) i s improving land
registration and access to rural finance and marketing information. The follow-on ADCP-I1
Project will further increase the earning capacity o f farmers and stimulate off-farm
commercial activities by strengthening rural financial services, improving market linkages and
product quality o f rural entrepreneurs and producers, further modernizing agricultural
knowledge and information activities, and expanding the pilot real estate registration system.
90. An Avian Influenza Preparedness Program i s supported by ADCP-I1 and finds from
restructuring o f the Second Institution Building and Technical Assistance project (IBTA-2).
The undisbursed balance o f IBTA-2 o f US$5 million has been allocated to finance emergency
needs for avian influenza preparedness. The objective o f this program is to minimize the threat
posed to humans and the poultry industry and to prepare for and be able to control a pandemic.
91. The ongoing Rural Investment Project is increasing rural household access to and use o f
basic infrastructure by financing demand-driven microprojects. I t includes construction or
rehabilitation o f economic infrastructure (roads, water, electricity) and social infrastructure
(schools and health clinics) based on priority needs identified by rural communities.
92. There i s an urgent need to rehabilitate irrigation and drainage systems to reverse
deterioration and make them more efficient. Nearly all agricultural production in Azerbaijan i s
irrigation fed. Two ongoing irrigation and drainage projects are improving the effectiveness
and financial viability o f distributing and managing irrigation water in target areas. The
Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project (RIDIP), which is helping rehabilitate the
first 50 kilometers o f the Samur-Absheron Canal, will close toward the end o f FY07. The
Irrigation System Improvement Project i s helping improve on-farm water management. A
26

follow-on Irrigation and Drainage I1 Project will expand coverage and support the
restructuring, institutional change, and further capacity building o f the water resource
authority. The new Water Sector Study provides the analytical basis for these activities.
Improving Transit Corridors and Traffic Management

93. Significant Bank investments will be made to improve Azerbaijan’s transit corridors. The
government plans to spend about US$1.5 billion to rehabilitate and reinforce major transit
highways and secondary roads over the next 10 years, about US$200-300 million o f which
may come from EBRD, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic Development Bank
(IsDB), and bilateral donors. The Bank will use a sector-wide approach to coordinate policy
and make investments to help develop the growing transit corridors. The on-going Highways I
and Highway I1 Projects are improving access and lower transport costs for goods and
passenger traffic moving along the East-West and North-South transit corridors and
strengthening the capacity o f the Road Transport Service Department to manage road
investment and maintenance, including outsourcing o f periodic maintenance. A proposed
continuation o f the series o f Transit Corridor and Traffic Management Projects will help
complete these highways as w e l l as access roads in order to enhance accessibility from villages
and small towns. The projects may also address traffic congestion in urban areas and support
the installation o f modern traffic management systems. Financing in the sector is estimated at
about US$500 million, depending on government cofinancing, and will be phased through a
series o f road operations. A comprehensive Transport Sector Review will underpin the
Bank’s investment in the sector.
94. Transit corridor projects will also support upgrading the safety and physical capacity o f the
railway network, which transports large and growing amounts o f oil. Tracks will be repaired,
and logistics hubs and trade facilitation infrastructure may be upgraded. The Railway
Transport and Trade Facilitation Project will seek to improve the competitiveness,
commercial orientation, and efficiency o f the national railway company, Azerbaijan Dovlet
Demir Y o l u (ADDY). The project will support the first phase o f railway modernization (three
to four years), including rationalizing the track and rolling stock asset base, increasing
productivity, setting up a new legal framework allowing ADDY to operate commercially and
to be corporatized, and building up management capacity.
Increasing the Quality and Coverage of Water Supply

95. Very large investments are needed across Azerbaijan to rehabilitate and improve water and
sanitation, not only in Baku but in secondary cities and towns. Underpinned by the FY06
Water Sector Study, a series o f National Water Supply and Sanitation Projects will finance
the repair and rehabilitation o f water production and distribution and wastewater facilities in
selected secondary cities and towns. Through a sector-wide approach they will support Azersu
and its subsidiary companies at the secondary town level to improve their capacity,
institutional and operational effectiveness, and commercial and financial viability. The
proposed series o f projects may in subsequent phases broaden the scope from water and
sanitation to other areas o f urban rehabilitation.

27

Improving the Reliability o f Energy Provision

96. The Bank is providing significant support to improve the reliability and efficiency o f
energy provision. Together with other donors (EBRD, KfW, IsDB, and the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation [JPIC]), i t is providing substantial fbnding to build new generation
capacity and rehabilitate generation and transmission systems, helping remedy years o f
neglect. Through the on-going Power Transmission Project, the Bank is upgrading the power
dispatch and transmission network, which will help alleviate frequent outages.
97. Expansion o f gas storage and treatment facilities would enable Azerbaijan to fully utilize
the gas resources that will soon be available from the Shah Deniz gas/condensate field.
Azerbaijan currently has two underground storage facilities, located at Galmaz and Garadag.
The need for gas storage i s expected to increase substantially in order to accommodate the gas
flow from the Shah Deniz field, starting in late 2006. The gas transmission and distribution
system suffers from decades o f l o w investments and insufficient maintenance. This leads to gas
leakage and flaring o f associated gas from older o i l wells. Investments in rehabilitating the
transmission system and upgrading and expanding the treatment plant would substantially
improve the cost-effectiveness o f the gas system. Such investments may attract Carbon Fund
financing, since they would reduce emissions o f greenhouse gases. Expanded gas storage
would help modulate the rigid gas supply flow to meet the daily and seasonal needs o f the
domestic gas market. T o some extent, i t would also support export markets. A possible
Energy/Gas Infrastructure Project may include financing gas storage expansion, gas treatment
plant upgrade, rehabilitation o f the pipeline system, and/or other investments in energy supply
reliability and efficiency. IFC will look into investment opportunities in these areas should
private sector, in particular FDI, interest arise.
Increasing the Financial Viability o f the Utility Sectors

98. The government’s strategy for improving the performance o f the utility sector aims at
commercializing and reducing explicit and implicit subsidies o f more than US$500 million.
Key measures include promoting increased private participation in the provision o f utility
services; implementing the medium-tern tariff policy for Azerbaijan, which incorporates a
transition to full cost recovery for utility service providers; implementation o f the new
accounting law, which will require that state-owned utilities adopt IFRS; creating an
appropriate regulatory environment, initially by strengthening the Tariff Council; and
strengthening competition, through a new competition law. The government recognizes the
need to ensure that utility services to consumers are affordable. Implementation o f a targeted
social safety net in July 2006 aims to ensure that the most vulnerable are able to afford
essential utility services as prices rise toward and eventually reach full cost-recovery levels.
The CPS will actively support these reform efforts through AAA; CAPSAP; sector projects in
power, gas, water, transport and possibly other essential infrastructure; and the ongoing
Pensions and Social Assistance Project.

c.

Pillar III:Improving the Quality of and Access to Social Services

99. With the support o f the Bank, the government will expand health care; modernize the
education system; target social assistance; improve the pension system; and improve living
28

conditions and economic opportunities for internally displaced people. A unique opportunity
exits during the next ten years to enter Azerbaijan into the globally competitive knowledge
economy, and ensure that health and social needs are properly cared for.
Expanding Coverage of Good-Quality Health Care Services

100. IDA has been active in the health sector through a small-scale Health Reform LIL,
implemented in five pilot provinces, and through the recently completed Health Sector
Review. Together with the new management at the Ministry o f Health, IDA is n o w supporting
a comprehensive sectonvide reform o f the healthcare system. The primary instrument is a
Health Sector Reform Project. K e y objectives are to build capacity in the Ministry o f Health
to guide the reform effort, rationalize and improve the delivery o f both primary and secondary
service, ensure sustainable health financing and resource allocation, and address longer-term
human resource needs in the health sector. The Bank’s projects in support o f clean water and
sanitation and reliable energy will also make an important contribution to the health o f the
population. A proposed Environmental Clean-up Project will alleviate exposure to health
hazards. IFC will consider supporting private investment in the sector with reputable and
experienced sponsors.
Modernizing the Education System

101. The government intends to accelerate reforms in the education system. The Bank is
supporting the government’s program through the ongoing Education Sector Development
APL, which supports systemwide reform to increase learning achievements for all students and
improve efficiency in the system. The first phase o f the project (2003-07) i s focusing on
quality improvement (through cumculum reform, teacher development, and provision o f
textbooks and reading materials); efficiency and financing (through budget reforms,
rationalization, and school improvement); equity and access to general education (through
school grants in selected less advantaged districts); and management strengthening (through
student assessment, management information systems, planning, and monitoring capacity). The
IDA Education Sector Development APL I1 will continue the approach and support
implementation o f successful pilot school rationalization activities across the country. A
proposed follow-on project would focus o n reform o f Higher Education to improve the
quality and relevance o f secondary and tertiary education and expand access. The vision is to
enable Azerbaijan to enter the global knowledge economy as a strong and competitive partner.
Specific investments could involve demand-driven investment finds that public and private
sector education and training institutions can access to adapt their programs to international
standards and monitor the relevance and demand for their programs. The Bank may also invest
in other areas o f developing the knowledge economy in Azerbaijan, such as modernizing
public library services and cultural heritage institutions.
Targeting Social Assistance and Improving the Pension System

102. The CPS will support structural reform o f the social safety net. The Bank i s active in
supporting the government’s reform program through its ongoing Pensions and Social
Assistance Project. The project aims to assist the government in better administering social
protection programs, making the pension system more sustainable, and building capacity to
29

better target social assistance benefits to the most vulnerable groups. The project will also help
mitigate the social impact o f utility sector reform. Follow-on Bank support may help
streamlining and improving services to the disabled, including improving capacity for
assessing disabilities; developing social care services for other vulnerable groups; improving
labor market services; developing and scaling up welfare services to facilitate school-to-work
transition for youth and foster their inclusion in society. The project m a y also help develop a
multipillar pension system and, based on the design o f the Health Sector Reform Project, a
modem health insurance system. Such support could take the form o f AAA, TA, and/or a
follow-on project. The Bank will continue to benchmark progress in social protection reform
and development o f social services and safety nets. A Social Protection Note, developed
jointly with the Ministry o f Labor and Social Protection o f the Population within the
Programmatic Poverty Assessment, will evaluate the poverty impact o f social transfers and
services.
Improving Living Conditions and Economic Opportunities o f Internally Displaced People

103. Thousands o f internally displaced people and refugees live in dilapidated school
dormitories, former hotels, and partly finished public buildings. Thousands o f others live in
informal settlements that often lack water supply and electricity, schools, or health facilities.
Economic opportunities are limited and unemployment i s high, especially outside Greater
Baku. The ongoing Internally Displaced People Economic Development Support Project
builds on the experience o f the recently completed Pilot Reconstruction Project to improve
the living conditions o f IDPs and enhance their economic opportunities and prospects for
social integration. Key elements include financing microprojects for essential basic social and
economic infrastructure and temporary shelters and extending finance for microenterprises. If
the conflict with Armenia over Nagomo-Karabakh i s resolved, a supplement to the CPS will be
presented to the Board for possible support to rehabilitation and resettlement.20

d.
Pillar I V : Improving Environmental Management and Furthering the
Climate Change Agenda
104. The CPS will provide assistance for the environment in two main areas. The first is
managing environmental challenges connected with development o f the o i l industry and
broader economic development, especially in coastal areas and including legacy pollution (the
brown agenda). The second is addressing sustainable natural resource management (the green
agenda). The CPS will also provide disaster management assistance.
Supporting the Brown Agenda

105. The proposed Absheron Environmental Clean-up Project, potentially supported by
the Bank, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), and other donors, will help launch a largeIn the event o f a peace agreement o n Nagorno-Karabakh, the Bank would support emergency reconstruction
efforts. Possible assistance could be provided for assessing needs, clearing mines, resettling internally displaced
people, rebuilding roads and other infrastructure, and providing basic health and education services. The Bank
would review a variety o f funding options, including funding through relevant grant programs, establishing a
donor t r u s t fund, using government funds, and extending additional IDA credits and IBRD loans.
2o

30

scale, long-term program to rehabilitate the areas around Baku in order to reduce the threat to
the health o f area residents and enable reutilization o f substantial areas o f valuable land. The
project will build on the technologies piloted under the Urgent Environmental Investment
Project, which closed in FY06. The project’s major objective is to help put in place regulatory,
institutional, and incentive structures to channel private sector investment into recovering oilcontaminated land and to ensure that all future o i l production meets international
environmental standards. The project could also include direct investment in clean-up o f high
priority legacy contamination.
106. The Bank’s involvement in the sectonvide infrastructure projects will help ensure that
such development takes place under clear adherence to international environmental standards
and that environmental screening i s mainstreamed in Azerbaijan. The Transport Corridor
and Water Projects will assess and review the impact o f the infrastructure o n the
environment. IFC has taken a leadership role in ensuring environmental screening through its
ongoing investment in the BTC pipeline; i t will continue to ensure environmental compliance
in all i t s investments. The CPS will also provide for environmental sector work, particularly
in private sector participation in environmental clean-up (which will support the Absheron
project) and in standards and regulations governing environmental liability and review (which
will support the larger infrastructure agenda).
107. The Bank will actively promote efforts to enable Azerbaijan to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions under the Carbon Financing Facility. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Azerbaijan could
attract financing for reduction in gas flaring, as well as clean technology investments in the
energy, industry, solid waste, municipal, and forestry sectors, by selling carbon offsets from
projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A PHRD grant has recently been signed for
the preparation o f a Gas Flaring Project. Opportunities will also be explored for potential
carbon financing associated with modernization o f power transmission, gas production,
transmission and distribution, and in other areas. To facilitate this work, the Bank m a y base a
technical expert in the Caucasus.
Supporting the Green Agenda

108. The ongoing Rural Environment Project, supported by IDA, GEF, and a Japanese
grant, aims to improve biodiversity conservation and introduce more sustainable natural
resource management and economic activities in two mountainous nature reserves. Bank
investments in the irrigation subsector will also provide benefits in terms o f rural
environmental sustainability. One o f the objectives o f the ongoing RIDIP i s to reduce water
logging and salinity on 36,000 hectares along the main drainage collectors. The ongoing
Irrigation System Improvement Project is helping improve on-farm water management,
which will also improve water use consistent with environmental land improvement. The new
Irrigation and Drainage I1 project proposed for FY08-09 will provide similar support.
ADCP-I1 will help train farmers in sound agriculture practices, including practices related to
ensuring environmental sustainability o f lands.
109. Building on i t s involvement in the ongoing Caspian Regional Program, the Bank will
continue to support the Caspian ecosystem. Together with UNDP, it will examine the potential
for a follow-on GEF Caspian Environment Program to assist Azerbaijan and other Caspian
31

countries in implementing policy reforms and priority investments that address sustainable
fisheries management, reduction o f transboundary pollution, and biodiversity conservation
priorities. The program would support capital investments, implementation o f policy reforms,
strengthening o f public institutions, and public participation and donor coordination through a
regional technical assistance component, implemented by UNDP and the United Nations
Environmental Program (UNEP), and an Investment Fund, implemented by the World Bank.
Other GEF opportunities, including Caspian-related pollution and coastal management, will be
explored.
StrengtheningNatural Disaster Management

110. The CPS includes a comprehensive Natural Disaster Management Review. The
review will engage the government, private sector, and civil society in a policy dialogue o n
strengthening the institutional arrangements for risk mitigation and disaster planning;
upgrading and refocusing the legal framework for emergency and disaster management; reequiping, restructuring, and updating hazard monitoring and prediction networks, which do not
meet modern standards; and increasing funding for the operation and maintenance o f the flood
protection infrastructure. The Review will address the status o f implementation o f the National
Disaster Risk Management Strategy and the National Action Plan; identify risks through a
comprehensive multihazard risk assessment; identify ways to protect critical infrastructure; and
support regional cooperation in r i s k management, particularly for hazard observations,
monitoring, and early warning and dissemination systems. A Disaster Management Project
could follow up this review, if the government finds such a project beneficial. The ongoing and
proposed series o f irrigation projects will address flood mitigation by rehabilitating major
canals.

e.

Knowledge Sharing?Advisory Services, and Capacity Building

Analytical Work

111. During the last CAS period, the Bank initiated a shift toward programmatic sector work
to provide a basis for focused and participatory policy dialogue on key issues. This trend will
continue, and additional efforts will be made to increase outreach and knowledge sharing
activities (table 6). The AAA and capacity-building program embodies a comprehensive range
o f diagnostics and monitoring activities through the Governance Action Plan (see section g
below). Technical assistance on structural reform provides a programmatic instrument for
continuous high-level dialogue on implementation o f the CPS policy framework as a
continuation o f the PRSC dialogue. The FY07/08 Country Economic Memorandum will
seek to identify binding constraints to rapid, broad-based investment and growth in the non-oil
economy and prioritize macroeconomic policy and structural reform options. PPERs will
support efficient and transparent budgeting and fiduciary arrangements, as w e l l as greater
effectiveness in public service delivery. Fiscal sustainability analysis will regularly feed into
the dialogue with the government concerning next year’s budget envelope, MTEF and PIP.
CPAR and CFAA updates will provide assessments o f Azerbaij an’s fiduciary framework and
procurement systems. An in-depth Water Sector Study will underpin increased lending in this
sector. In transport the Bank is working closely with the ADB, which i s leading a
comprehensive sector review. Programmatic Poverty Assessments will continue to support
32

development o f a cost-effective social safety net and strengthen understanding o f inequality in
income distribution. The Health Sector Review completed in FY05 laid the basis for the Health
Sector Reform project. An Education Sector Review will focus o n improvements in higher
education. An Environmental Review will hrther the on-going dialogue o n building an
effective regime for optimal use o f Azerbaijan’s natural resources and protection o f the
environment. During the CPS period the Bank will also explore the possibility o f entering into
a Joint Economic Research Program with Azerbaijan.

Self-Standing Capacity-BuildingActivities

112. An IDF grant i s helping build a more comprehensive e-procurement system. An
Accounting and Auditing Reform IDF grant is helping implement accounting and auditing
legislative reforms, harmonize sources o f accounting guidance, and strengthen the Chamber o f
Auditors. IFC will continue on-going technical and advisory services to improve the business
environment, including through FIAS and PEP work. The Financial Sector Technical
Assistance Project i s providing technical and advisory services to the government and the
National Bank o f Azerbaijan to build financial sector infrastructure, support the next phase o f
banking sector restructuring, and further strengthen institutional capacity at the National Bank.
113. The National Bank o f Azerbaijan participates in the Reserves Advisory and
Management Program (RAMP) conducted by the World Bank Treasury. As part o f the
33

RAMP engagement, which normally lasts three years, Treasury specialists provide on-site
consulting and training to National Bank o f Azerbaijan staff in various aspects o f reserves
management. The advisory services are combined with an asset management program designed
to support the overall technology transfer objectives o f the program.

114. The Ministry o f Communications and I T has expressed interest in establishing one or
more core pilot Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) Centers in Azerbaijan.
Several universities with videoconferencing facilities have been identified as potential centers,
and the first center i s expected to be established in Azerbaijan in 2006. GDLN programming i s
currently delivered through the Baku World Bank Country Office, covering such topics as
youth policy, investment climate, judicial reform, e-government, and accounting training.
Capacity Building under Investment Projects

115. Bank technical assistance in the rural sector helped establish a Rural Policy Unit that
has developed a national strategy and investment plan to enhance competitiveness in the
agriculture sector. Technical assistance is also being provided to build the capacity o f local
communities and regional offices o f the Agency for Support o f the Development o f the
Agricultural Private Sector to prepare and implement small-scale, community-driven rural
investment projects. Technical assistance under the Financial Services Development Project is
helping corporatize and strengthen Azeri Post’s capacity to serve rural areas. In irrigation
technical assistance to the State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee, and District Irrigation
Exploitation Units has helped these institutions take initial steps toward increased operational
efficiency and improved irrigation management. Bank-funded technical assistance helped
reorganize the Absheron Regional Water Company into a joint stock company, strengthen its
capacity through a twinning arrangement, and improve its operational and administrative
effectiveness. Technical assistance in the power sector i s helping improve management o f the
state power generatiodtransmission company, Azerenergy, and prepare i t for a restructured
energy sector. Capacity-building assistance has helped restructure, modernize, and strengthen
the management capacity o f the Road Transport Services Department o f the Ministry o f
Transport, the main agency responsible for national road development.

116. Technical assistance i s being funded to build the capacity o f the Ministry o f Labor and
Social Protection o f Population to undertake knowledge-based policy formulation, develop
targeting mechanisms, and effectively deliver targeted social assistance. Capacity in the State
Social Protection Fund is also being built to improve its ability to efficiently and transparently
administer the pension system. Bank technical assistance is helping the Ministry o f Education
strengthen financing, budgeting, personnel management, and planning in order to improve the
use o f financial, human, and physical resources in the sector. Technical assistance under the
Health Sector Reform Project is stimulating a national dialogue o n health reform and primary
health care and strengthening the capacity o f the Ministry o f Health to plan, implement, and
evaluate health reforms. In both health and education, the Bank i s supporting the Ministry o f
Finance’s collaboration with line ministries in moving to program budgeting, decentralization,
IPSAS, and better internal financial control and expenditure tracking. Several Bank projects
support statistical capacity building.

Financing Scenario and Portfolio Management

117. Azerbaijan i s currently an IDNIBRD blend country. IDA allocations o n the basis o f
IDA’Sperformance-based allocations system are set at SDR53 m i l l i o n (US$79.4 million) for
F Y 0 7 and indicatively at SDR34.4 million (US$51.5 million) for FY08.** Azerbaijan i s
considered creditworthy to receive IBRD financing o f up to US$250 m i l l i o n a year on average.
The government has indicated that this figure should be seen as indicative and that the actual
level o f IBRD lending will depend critically o n several factors, including: the degree o f
cofinancing provided by the government, the ability o f the country to effectively utilize funds,
and on the level o f timely value-added the Bank Group i s able to deliver relative to the
government financing projects on its own. For its part, the Bank has indicated that it will pay
particular attention to the CPS monitoring indicators in Table 8, which draw on the annual
CPIA process, with a higher (or lower) level o f IBRD lending associated with faster (or
slower) progress toward achieving the targeted outcomes. Azerbaijan’s overall CPIA ratings
has increased substantially since 2000, especially governance indicators, but remained
unchanged from 2005 to 2006 at 3.7. A slight downgrading o f scores for macroeconomic and
fiscal policies, due to concerns about the very expansive budget stance, was counterbalanced
by increases in scores on gender equality and equity in the use o f public resources. The
portfolio quality i s good, with n o problem projects or projects at risk in 2005.
118. In the event o f any significant deterioration in either economic conditions or the
governance environment, IBRD lending would be reduced to a lower case o f about US$lOO
million. In assessing this the Bank would pay special attention to each o f the following
economic considerations: serious deterioration in macroeconomic stability, inconsistent
aggregate demand policies, significant private sector crowding out, and monetary and
exchange rate policies that do not target price stability. Such a scenario would be signaled, e.g.,
by CPIA indicators for macroeconomic management and fiscal policy falling to the 2.5 range
or below. Fiscal sustainability analysis will be a recurrent part o f the programmatic PER
activities. Other signals would include a decline in other relevant indicators available from
reputable third parties, including ratings by international rating agencies. The l o w case would
also be considered in the event o f a major deterioration ofgovernance and increase in the
Bank’s reputational risk. Particular attention would be paid to serious shortfalls in progress
toward implementation milestones under Pillar 1 (public sector management and corruption) o f
the CPS and the relevant CPIA indicators.
119. A summary o f the projects proposed during the CPS period is provided in table 7. I t i s
an all-investment program. I t i s expected that IDA allocations will be phased out through a

managed transition to IBRD-only status during the CPS period, based on Azerbaijan’s
improved creditworthiness. An appropriate transition period remains critical to ensure that
adequate support i s provided to governance reforms and the social sectors in areas in which the
government finds i t hard to borrow o n IBRD terms.

IDA financing beyond FY07 are indicative only. Actual allocations will depend on: (i)
the country’s own
performance; (ii)
i t s performance relative to that o f other IDA recipients; (iii)
the amount o f overall resources
available t o IDA; and (iv) changes in the list o f active IDA-eligible countries.

costs, perhaps providing up to 50 percent later o n for high-priority projects. The Bank will also
be looking to strategic partners, such as EBRD, EIB and the ADB, in the field o f infrastructure.
The transit corridor and water programs have deliberately been set out as a sequence o f
separate projects, so that the extension o f subsequent projects will depend o n the speed o f
implementation o f the previous project. This phased approach will enable the country to avoid
excessive commitment charges, and it will allow the Bank and the government to remain
flexible to adjust the focus to emerging priorities.
121. As o f now, Bank procurement and financial management procedures will b e used for
all projects, as it is too early to consider the use o f national systems. On the other hand, the
Bank’s dialogue and project designs will be comprehensive and sectonvide. In this way Bank
procedures will be leveraged by substantial public funds. The government views this
arrangement as a welcome way o f safeguarding the proper use o f budget resources and
leveraging use o f the Bank’s environment and social safeguard procedures. Special attention
will be given to strengthening project implementation and supervision ensuring that
recordkeeping is transparent, and Bank standards for procurement and financial management
are widely understood and adhered to. The Board will be informed in the event o f any systemic
deterioration o f the economic or social environment.
122. Country financing parameters for Azerbaijan were established in 2005 in consultation
with the government. These provide for added flexibility in allowing Bank financing o f up to
100 percent and recurrent cost financing on a selective basis, Bank financing o f local and
foreign costs in any proportion, and Bank financing o f local taxes and duties. The additional
flexibility should support project implementation and is fully consistent with the approach o f
the CPS in emphasizing government ownership o f the underlying project objectives and target
results agreed (see annex 7).

g.

Governance - a Crosscutting Objective of the CPS

123. Taken together the CPS AAA and projects described above form an elaborate
Governance Action Plan and strict monitoring o f results and project execution within a
coordinated Governance Monitoring Framework. Figure 4 summarizes key dimensions o f the
governance framework supported by the CPS interventions. In terms o f overall political
accountability the CPS will continue the support to the PRSP/SPPRSD process, even though
Azerbaijan is rapidly becoming a middle-income country, as well as supporting the
implementation o f the associated State Programmes. This will help ensure that the
government’s stated action plan get implemented with proper oversight o f civil society.
124. In terms o f effective public sector management, the CPS AAA will support good
macroeconomic and public expenditure planning and management through our continuous
policy advice and TA, including a C E M and a sequence o f participatory programmatic PERs.
Public financial management and procurement will be supported by public sector accounting
reform (through CAPSAP), treasury modernization, e-procurement, and updates o f the C F A A
and CPAR. The CPS will support implementation o f Public administrative and governance
reform in selected areas o f the relevant State Programmes. Reduction o f subsidies will be
supported though CPS policy advice, accounting reform and investment operations in the
37

utilities sector. And in the social sectors targeted interventions will further effectiveness o f
public service delivery.
125. In terms o f checks and balances within the overall governance framework, the CPS will
support judicial reform, the strengthening o f external and internal audit functions, and stronger
supervisory institutions in the financial markets. The CPS with FIAS will help establish better
consumer protection against monopolistic behavior and investors’ protection through modem
laws and agencies according to international standards. The CPS will also support civil society
and the private sector oversight through enhanced disclosure, transparency and accountability
frameworks, such as EITI, disclosure o f Oil Fund, SOCAR and public finances, and structured
public/private dialogue on streamlining the business environment.
Better corporate
governance and financial transparency will be supported through the accounting and auditing
reform, while environmental responsibility will be enhanced through Pillar I V o f the CPS. This
includes support for SOCAR to move to international standards.
126. In terms o f local participation and community empowerment, the CPS Pillar I1
supports, among other things, rural infrastructure community driven development (CDD),
formation o f water users associations for irrigation, and farmers’ credit cooperatives. At the
reform level, a new legal framework for NGOs and streamlined registration o f legal entities
and real estate will be supported.
127.
Implementation o f the governance agenda will be monitored and prioritized o n the
basis o f a shared framework in global partnership with multilateral and bilateral donors, and
with government ownership and civil society participation. A Governance Advisory Group
will be established to coordinate these activities, derive lessons and identify binding constraints
to achieving the objectives o f the Governance Action Plan. Special precaution will be taken to
strengthen Project Implementation Units (PIUS), transparent record keeping, and safeguarding
Bank standards for procurement and financial management o f projects. The Governance
Monitoring Framework includes, e.g., EITI, PEFA and PIFC programs, Public Expenditure
Tracking Surveys (PETS), F S M update and ROSCs, Doing Business Reports, BEEPS, CPIA,
as well as WBI Governance Indicators. The framework i s embedded in the CPS comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation framework.

h.

Monitoring and Evaluation

128. The CPS contains a detailed Results Matrix (annex l),
which defines the four-year
development outcomes that Bank Group assistance aims to help achieve. A CPS M i d - T e r n
Review will be conducted two years into the program, at which point any adjustments to the
strategy will be made. A comprehensive evaluation o f the CPS will be carried out in a CPS
Completion Report at the end o f the CPS period. This evaluation will assess the extent to
which CPS objectives were achieved and draw lessons for future assistance.

129. Progress in implementing the CPS will be monitored through several channels. First,
regular reviews o f structural reforms will be conducted in the context o f the CPS program
monitoring and support to implementation o f the PRSC policy framework. Second, sectoral
reforms and progress reports will be evaluated during supervision o f the various Bank
investment projects. Third, monitoring o f public expenditures will b e conducted under the

three-year PPER. Fourth, monitoring o f progress toward poverty reduction and MDG
achievement will be assessed through a Programmatic Poverty Assessment. Detailed
monitoring indicators and baselines for health, education, and social protection have been
defined. Data from various surveys will strengthen outcome and impact monitoring. The
governance agenda i s crosscutting and integrated with the Result Framework. Assistance from
other donors also supports strengthened monitoring capacity in government agencies.
130. The Bank will continue the current practice o f formally reviewing the PRSC matrix
(with annual adjustments as appropriate) with the government and reporting o n progress and
issues. Resources are included in the work program to finance technical work o n the policy
items concerned. This work will feed into the annual CPS reviews o f the overall objectives and
intermediate milestones in the Results Framework.
13 1. A core set o f higher level progress indicators are outlined in table 8. In most cases high
level baselines and targets for 2010 are based on the published CPIA methodology. These
indicators are selected as aggregate measures o f macroeconomic stability, governance and
transparency o n the one hand, and economic and social progress on the other.

i.

Externa1 Partnerships

132. The Bank has a strong history in Azerbaijan in collaborating closely with other
partners, in particular on structural reform. Collaboration will continue during the CPS period
in a variety o f areas described in annex 6.
133. The Bank and the IMF are coordinating closely on the overall reform program. The
fifth review o f the IMF-supported PRGF was completed satisfactorily in June 2005, and
Azerbaijan has now graduated to surveillance-only status. Critical support i s also provided by
USAID, the ADB, the European Union, and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) for
capacity building and economic policy formulation. The EU TACIS has helped modernize the
tax system and we are working closely on accounting reform. The Bank i s working with
U S A I D on treasury systems and advising the government on the PIP. W e have also teamed up
with the U.S. Treasury on budgetary reform and i s working with EBRD and U S T D A on
SOCAR restructuring. With DFID and other donors, the Bank is actively supporting the EITI
in Azerbaijan and monitoring i t s implementation. The Bank has joined with the ADB,
Switzerland, and UNDP to support the formulation and implementation o f the SPPRSD.
UNDP has been particularly helpful in integrating the monitoring o f the MDGs into the recent
SPPRED progress report.
134. Azerbaijan was admitted to the ENP in 2005, creating the opportunity for the European
Union and Azerbaijan to develop an increasingly close mutually beneficial relationship. Under
the ENP, the European Union i s expected to contribute more actively to resolution o f regional
conflict. While the Action Plan is s t i l l under discussion, it seems likely that the European
Union will play a leading role on the continued implementation o f electoral reform o n the basis

40

o f the recommendations o f the Council o f EuropeNenice Commission and the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights,
as well as improving the organization o f the judiciary, with a view to ensuring its greater
independence, impartiality, and efficiency. Other priority areas may include improving the
business environment; harmonizing laws, standards, and administrative procedures; combating
corruption; supporting balanced and sustained economic development; and strengthening EUAzerbaijan cooperation o n energy and transport and integration o f markets and networks.

Consultations

135. In preparation for the CPS the Bank and I F C consulted with a wide range o f civil
society representatives, business associations, high-level officials from across the government
and with parliamentarians that made the development o f this CPS a very participatory process
(see annex 5).

136. NGO representatives felt that the Bank’s expertise and technical assistance o n
managing o i l revenues was critical.
Participants welcomed health and education as
problematic sectors that warranted priority attention from the international community. Other
areas emphasized were S M E development and irrigation. Participants expressed general
appreciation o f their involvement in the government’s poverty reduction strategy preparation
process but indicated that there was inadequate NGO involvement in the implementation and
monitoring o f Bank funded projects.
137. During the CPS preparation the I F C consulted with business associations, the NGO
Forum, the Entrepreneurship Development Foundation, as well as with entrepreneurs from
various sectors such as agribusiness, I T and telecom, tourism and hospitality and building
materials. Entrepreneurs expressed great interest in partnering with IFC. Associations
requested more I F C direct involvement to help grow SMEs and improving the business
environment. NGOs would like to participate more in providing views on projects I F C is
involved with.
138. NGOs and business associations would like to participate more in the whole cycle o f
Bank projects, analytical work and policy dialogue with the government. The voice o f the civil
society should be accounted for when results o f projects are evaluated. It would also create a
good example for the government, which - although gradually becoming more open to the civil
society - still has to make significant efforts to treat the civil society organizations as partners.
The donors raised an issue o f the national capacity to implement the CPS infrastructure
investment program. There is a risk that the limited capacity combined with political pressure
on quick results may lead to compromising on quality.
139. The recent Client Survey reveals a shift in perceptions as to Azerbaijan’s major
development challenges and the Bank’s role. In 2003 the three major challenges identified
were poverty (22 percent), the economy (19 percent), and political problems/instability (11
percent). N o w the major challenges are seen as the unresolved regional conflict (39 percent),
corruption (18 percent), and education (15 percent). The Bank is seen as most effective in: (i)
infrastructure; (ii)
the financial system (which has significantly risen since the last survey); and
(iii)
monitoring poverty. The role o f the Bank’s knowledge services is increasingly valued.
The perception that the Bank plays a relevant overall role in Azerbaijan’s development remains
positive (with a rating o f 7 on a 1-10 scale). However, the perception that the Bank‘s financial
resources were its greatest value f e l l sharply from 38 percent in 2003 to 28 percent. There is a
strong feeling that respondents like to work with the Bank (8.5) and that the Bank treats clients
with respect (7.9).

42

VII. Managing R i s k s
140.

The primary risks to the proposed CPS include the following:

Risk of delays or waning consensus in implementing key elements of the reform program.
Not having been one o f the ‘early reformers’ among the CIS transition countries,
Azerbaijan still has a very substantial reform agenda ahead in both the economic and social
spheres. The reforms supported by the Bank have been solid during the past five years, but

progress has sometimes been slow and not always linear. T o mitigate the risks o f reforms
being deterred and/or delayed, the Bank will support an active outreach process centered on
the country’s PRSP, in terms both o f substance and o f engaging the public in its
formulation and monitoring. In addition, the Bank will conduct semestral reviews o f
progress with respect to the core CPS reforms and monitoring indicators in Table 8, using
these not only to track progress but as opportunities for continuing engagement o f a wide
range o f public and private actors around strategic reforms and obstacles that may be
impeding achieving them.
Risk of state capture and corruption. Several surveys have evidenced the perception o f
persistent corruption and state capture in Azerbaijan, which could derail achievement o f the
development objectives the CPS i s supporting. T o mitigate this risk, the CPS, through its
AAA and projects, embodies a comprehensive governance action plan o f political
accountability with civil society oversight, effective public sector management, financial

accountability and disclosure through strengthening institutions performing checks and
balances. Implementation o f the governance agenda will be monitored and prioritized on
the basis o f a shared framework in global partnership with multilateral and bilateral donors,
and with government ownership and civil society participation. Special precaution will be
taken to strengthen project implementation units, transparent record keeping, and
safeguarding Bank standards for procurement and financial management o f projects. The
Governance Monitoring Framework includes, e.g., EITI, PEFA and PIFC programs, Public
Expenditure Tracking Surveys, FSAP update and ROSCs, Doing Business Reports,
BEEPS, CPIA, as well as WBI Governance Indicators. The framework i s embedded in the
CPS comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework.
Resource flow risk. Volatile energy p r i c e s - o r unexpected disruptions in pipelines or gas
projects-could seriously affect resource flows and public finances, delaying
implementation o f poverty reduction measures. These risks are mitigated by the State Oil

Fund, which cushions the budget revenues from o i l exports by smoothing out potential
volatilities in the current inflows o f o i l revenues.

Macroeconomic management risk. As o i l revenues start increasing dramatically, so will

spending pressures and inflationary pressures. Mismanagement o f o i l revenues and Dutch
disease could slow implementation o f the reform programs. This risk should be set against
a track record o f 10 years o f responsible macroeconomic management, including during the
boom in inflows o f FDI, and the avoidance o f large external debt or ill-conceived public
investments. Looking forward, the risk i s mitigated by the Bank’s and the Fund’s
continued policy dialogue o n macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.

43

Azerbaijan’s active participation in EITI will be closely monitored and CAPSAP will
support financial accountability and transparency o f revenues from extractive industries,
including SOCAR. The rules for Oil Fund spending are clearly set out in the Budget
Systems L a w and SOFAZ’s regulatory framework. Spending out o f the Oil Fund must be
part o f the consolidated budget approved by Parliament. 22 All Oil Fund spending has to go
through the single Treasury account. The CPS will monitor adherence to these principles.
The dialogue on macroeconomic management and fiscal sustainability will be continuously
supported by the PPERs, which are aimed at assisting the authorities to avoid the risk o f
too high inflation and too rapid or inefficient public spending, including Oil Fund
spending. The large infrastructure projects o f the CPS will directly support proper
management o f public funds. The cost o f rebuilding the infrastructure o f Azerbaijan to
modem standards i s relatively limited relative to the expected o i l and gas windfall. Our
emphasis is therefore to continuously staying engaged in macroeconomic management,
extractive industries transparency, sound long-term o i l revenue management, budget
preparation processes, financial accountability, and sound implementation o f the public
investment program.
Regional security risk. There has been a clear shift toward increasing stability in the South
Caucasus over recent years, particularly given developments in Georgia since the ‘Rose
Revolution’, which have enhanced opportunities for cooperation in developing the regional
transport and energy corridor. Nonetheless, the potential for renewed conflict with
Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh cannot be ruled out -- nor can the upside potential o f a
resolution o f the conflict during this CPS period. The international community, in
particular the Minsk Group o f the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, i s
carefully mediating this issue. Meanwhile, the Bank will continue to assist government

efforts to improve the well-being o f the population which has been displaced by the
conflict.

Portfolio management risk. While the portfolio quality i s good and there are no reported
outstanding issues, the risk o f corruption will be vigilantly addressed. This includes a high
level o f precaution and supervision o f procurement and financial management o f projects
as outlined in box 2.
The likelihood of Bank engagement on the breadth of activities in the CPS is high. The CPS
supports the continuation o f our long-term partnership with Azerbaijan from the previous
CAS and the PRSC. As noted in the CAS Completion Report (annex 3), all projects
proposed in the previous CAS were successfully approved and started. FY06 brought this
agenda forward with another four very important projects. The government has shown its
strong commitment to move forward rapidly with the reform agenda, including CAPSAP.

The e-government and public reform activities will require a flexible and realistic approach

The Budget System L a w requires that: (i)
parliament approve the deficit and expenditure ceilings o f the
consolidated budget including Oil Fund expenditure; (ii)
a l l expenditures in the consolidated budget (except for
expenditures o n the management o f S O F A Z and its assets) be executed by the treasury, and that a l l capital
Ministry o f Finance t o be responsible for the preparation o f the consolidated
expenditures b e part o f the PIP; (iii)
budget; (iv) that extra-budgetary funds not make portfolio investments in domestic commercial activities o r issue
loans or loan guarantees; and (v) SOFAZ h o l d equity positions only through highly rated professional portfolio
managers in international markets.
22

44

in the choice o f instruments. Financial sector activities and the infrastructure agenda to a
large extent are continuations o f well-established sequences o f activities. Likewise in the
social sectors, the proposed education projects are natural next steps o f the ongoing APL,
and the successful social protection reform will be continued. On the environmental

agenda, the President o n September 28, 2006, issued an important decree delineating
detailed plans and time schedules for restoring environmental sustainability on the
Absheron Peninsular and for the country as a whole. The CPS will directly engage in this
program. Azerbaijan has the monetary resources to implement the agenda laid out in the
CPS. With the CPS partnership the government wishes to have the Bank as its trusted
fiduciary partner to make sure things are done right and public resources not wasted. The
challenge for the World Bank Group i s to deliver in a timely manner the quality expert
advice and project management services that Azerbaijan needs to continue to succeed in i t s
rapid development.

45

Box 2: Safeguarding the Integrity of the Bank’s Portfolio
The World Bank Group has been taking a range o f measures to improve monitoring and strengthen
governance o f its own portfolio, and w i l l undertake additional measures in the CPS.
A

Existing Measures to Minimize Corruption Risks in the Bank Portfolio:

i

Maintaining diligent capacity and risk assessments o f fiduciary aspects o f Bank-financed portfolio
through (i)
financial management systems assessment (staffing, internal controls, accounting systems,
disbursements and auditing arrangements), including risk assessment at country, entity and project
level, to ensure funds are used for purposes intended; and (ii)
procurement assessment and extensive
post reviews conducted to ensure compliance with Bank procurement guidelines; and (iii)
financial
management and procurement capacity building o f project implementing agenciedentities staff to
assure adequate project implementation performance.
11 Ensuring strong financial management and portfolio review functions and responsibilities in the
... Country Office.
111 Joint BarWGovernment country portfolio performance reviews, and vigilant Bank follow up on
implementation o f agreed-upon Action Plan to strengthen overall quality o f portfolio implementation
and performance.
iv Securing close linkages between the AAA program (particularly the Programmatic PER and Poverty
Assessment) and lending support to ensure adequate attention to the efficient and transparent use o f
public resources and monitoring and evaluation o f outcomes.
V
Regular capacity assessment o f external audit f i r m s interested in auditing Bank-financed projects.
v i Continuous support to the accounting, auditing, procurement, supervisory and regulatory agencies
through institutional capacity building, legal and regulatory reforms i.e. introduction o f new
Accounting Law mandating International Financial Reporting Standards for Public Interest Entities
including State-owned enterprises to enhance accountability and transparency in financial reporting
and capacity building o f the Chamber o f Accounts, the country’s Supreme Audit Institution (SAI).
v i i Vigorous investigation and follow-up to any allegations o f fraud and corruption in Bank projects.
B

New Additional Measures to be implemented during the CPS Period:

1

Diligent and consistent application o f the Governance Action Plan and its principles in all new
programs.
Focus on accountability and transparency in corporate and public sectors, through the proposed
Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project.
Further capacity building in procurement capabilities and portfolio review in the Country Office, with
HQretaining oversight and quality control function
Operational reviews o f internal controls and key operations carried out every two years, in
conjunction with Mid-term reviews.
Increased frequency o f procurement audits to ensure implementation o f Bank procurement guidelines
to promote greater transparency in the bidding process and contract award.
Increased supervision resources and intensive projects supervision by Bank staff.
Special emphasis placed on the development o f synergies between Bank-financed projects, to
develop country-level safeguards with respect to fiduciary arrangements.
Bank support to NGOs serving as catalyst to external monitoring and communication to the public on
use o f public funds.
Promotion o f greater transparency and accountability through disclosure o f contract awards and
financial information.

Annex 2
Results Framework and Baselines for the
State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development, 200615
Strategic Goals
Analysis o f the main characteristics o f the poverty situation in the country has led to the
formulation o f the nine strategic goals for 2006-15. These goals are a logical continuation o f
the previous poverty reduction program, State Programme on Poverty Reduction and
Economic Development (SPPRED):

1.
2.
3.

4.

5.
6.
7.
8.

9.

Ensure economic growth and maintain macroeconomic stability.
Create enabling conditions to improve income-generation opportunities, especially in
the non-oil sector, in the regions, and in rural areas.
Improve the quality o f and ensure equal access to basic health and education services.
Reducing income poverty is not enough if public services do not work properly.
Improve public administration and governance. Good governance and the continuous
evolution o f public institutions are internationally recognized as essential to successful
integration and competition in the global economic system. M o d e m states require a
capacity for coping with institutional change to ensure strong, transparent, and
accountable public institutions, staffed by a professional civil service, guided by
appropriate laws, and reinforced by a responsive judicial system.
Improve public infrastructure. This i s a prerequisite for attracting foreign and local
investment and creating jobs while reducing differences in living conditions by
guaranteeing the entire population access to basic utilities.
Reform the social protection system to better protect vulnerable groups, especially
children.
Improve the living conditions o f refugees and internally displaced people, particularly
vulnerable groups that require special attention and policy measures.
Ensure that government policy and programs in a l l sectors promote and protect gender
equality.
Ensure that all economic development policies and programs and related legislation
respect the principles o f environmental sustainability.

M a i n Targets
Targets have been set to measure the achievement o f the nine strategic goals (table A2.1). The
aim is to achieve these quantifiable outcomes by 2015 by implementing policy measures set

C A S Completion Report, FY03-05
The CAS Completion Report reviews the experience in implementing the FY03-05 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Azerbaijan. The C A S for the Republic o f Azerbaijan (Report
No. 25790-AZ) was delivered to the Board M a y 27, 2003, along with the government’s
poverty reduction strategy document, the State Programme o n Poverty Reduction and
Economic Development (SPPRED) (Report No. 25593-AZ). The C A S was designed to assist
the government in implementing the first phase o f the SPPRED. The Completion Report
examines the relevance o f the CAS to Azerbaijan’s longer-tern national goals, the
achievement o f CAS outcomes, and Bank performance in furthering CAS outcomes.

Longer-Term Strategic Goals Supported by the Bank

Azerbaijan faces the challenge o f translating its temporary o i l boom into sustainable
economic growth and poverty reduction. During the past few years, the government has set
the stage for a period o f large-scale o i l and gas revenues. Barring new discoveries, the
revenue stream from o i l and gas is projected to peak in the next 10 years and to decline
thereafter. The critical challenge facing Azerbaijan i s thus to ensure prudent and transparent
management o f these resources so that they are used to stimulate economic growth in the nono i l sector and improve public social service delivery while maintaining macroeconomic
stability. The government, with support from the Bank and IMF, established the State Oil
Fund (SOFAZ), which mandates a high standard o f transparency in managing o i l and gas
revenues. A large proportion o f revenues i s being saved for future generations in the form o f
foreign financial assets, a politically difficult decision in a country with serious infrastructure
and public service gaps, a high poverty rate, and pressing immediate needs.
T o reduce poverty, the government with the SPPRED set medium-term goals o f
facilitating an enabling environment for growth o f income-generating opportunities;
maintaining macroeconomic stability; improving the quality o f and equity in access to basic
health and education services; improving infrastructure (including roads, delivery o f utility
services, communications, irrigation); reforming the system o f social protection to give more
effective protection to the vulnerable; and improving the living conditions and opportunities
for refugees and internally displaced people. The Joint Bank-Fund Staff Assessment Note
(JSAN) o f the SPPRED concluded that the strategy is credible, that its broad policy priorities
are appropriate and consistent with the multidimensional nature o f poverty reduction, and that
i t reflected the need for balanced growth through development o f non-oil sectors and a
reduction in the differences in development between Baku and the rest o f the country.
The FY03-05 CAS was closely aligned with the SPPRED. During FY03-05
Azerbaijan’s main challenges were to maintain stability in the face o f high levels o f foreign
investment into the o i l sector, establish the institutions to enable proper management o f o i l
revenues expected from FY06 onward, improve the environment for growth in non-oil
sectors, and increase access to and the quality o f public social services.

61

The Bank Group strategy to support the SPPRED and help achieve sustainable poverty
reduction was organized into four strategic goals:
Pillar I:Manage the oil boom to maintain macroeconomic stability, avoid Dutch
disease, and facilitate non-oil growth, employment, and pro-poor expenditures.
Pillar 11: Generate jobs and non-oil growth by improving the business environment
and access to financial services, building support infrastructure for small and mediumsize enterprises, and stimulating agriculture.
Pillar 111: Improve access to services by reversing the decline in social services and
assistance and in infrastructure.
Pillar IV: Help realize the oil potential to the extent and within the time-frame the
SPPRED presumes.
Both the government’s strategic goals and the Bank’s CAS objectives remained
relevant throughout the period o f the CAS. Given the difficult experience o f many countries
in managing resource booms, the emphasis on helping to fully realize the o i l potential while
promoting prudent management o f the revenue flows was highly relevant. Stimulating
development o f non-oil sectors, such as agriculture, agro-processing, manufacturing, transit
trade, and logistical services, i s also essential to create employment and ensure sustained
economic growth after oil reserves are depleted. Key elements o f improving the environment
for investment and growth in non-oil sectors are governance, removing impediments in the
regulatory and administrative environment, and improving infrastructure and utility services.
Azerbaijan inherited relatively good social indicators from the Soviet era, but these
deteriorated during the 1990’s. The challenge i s to turn this situation around and develop a
system that meets modem needs.

Bank Group Assistance Instruments

Bank assistance comprised intensive policy dialogue through adjustment lending and AAA,
complemented by investments in infrastructure, the social sectors, and rural development.
Recognizing that a window o f opportunity existed before major o i l and gas revenues would
come on stream, the Bank Group’s overall strategy has been to promote an intensive dialogue
to strengthen governance, help define and prioritize policy reforms, disseminate international
development experience, and provide high quality technical expertise and know-how in
designing and implementing public investment projects.

The CAS laid out a base case scenario in which the Bank would lend $163 million
($123 million in IDA and $40 million in IBRD funds) through nine projects. All nine projects
were delivered, and a smooth transition from IDA-only to IDNIBRD blend status was
achieved (table A3.1). The first IBRD loan went to the Board in FY05. The C A S also laid out
a high-case scenario, with enhanced PRSC lending and IBRD lending in infrastructure.
Azerbaijan f e l l short o f meeting the high-case triggers, mainly because o f inadequate progress
in restructuring the State Oil Company o f the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), as discussed
below. Country performance was sufficient to increase Azerbaijan’s performance-based IDA
62

allocation, and a 10th project for internally displaced people was approved. I F C committed
$66 million (3 percent equity and 97 percent loans) o f i t s o w n funds to nine projects and
arranged $61.43 million in syndications, mainly in the financial and o i l sectors. I F C also
supported a regional project that will benefit Azerbaijan, a $30 million leasing facility for
Central Asia, intended to make leasing a viable alternative to private sector.
There was a clear shift to a programmatic approach in both lending (via A p L s and
PRSCs) and AAA (such as the programmatic PER and Poverty Assessment). Adjustment
lending, closely integrated with individual sector loans and programmatic AAA, was used to
spearhead sectoral reforms. Bank investment lending was also used to leverage larger
investments by the government, the private sector, and other donors.
Projects funded during the CAS period benefited from a range o f AAA on non-oil
sector trade, investment, and trade facilitation; public expenditures; poverty; fiduciary and
procurement systems; education and health; energy and other infrastructure; and the financial
sector. M u c h o f IFC’s advisory work in Azerbaijan focused on creating opportunities in the
non-oil sectors, including through improved financial intermediation to support private sector
growth and growth o f small and medium-size enterprises. Other program highlights included
a leasing development project, a corporate governance program, a linkages program for small
and medium-size enterprises, and a FDI conference organized to focus global attention o n the
progress o f economic reforms and the future investment potential o f Azerbaijan in non-oil
sectors. FIAS has provided advisory services to Azerbaijan’s Investment Promotion and
Advisory Foundation and consulted on improving Azerbaijan’s investment legislation. As
noted in the CPS above, during FY06 the strategy was continued through an active AAA
program and four major new projects were approved.

Achievement o f CAS Objectives
Overall Poverty Reduction

At the national level, the proportion o f poor people declined from 44.6 percent in 2002 to 24
percent in 2005, a decline o f 46 percent (table A3.2). The proportion o f people living in
extreme poverty declined from 26.9 percent o f the population in 2002 to 9.2 percent in 2005.
These findings based o n comparable Household Budget Survey (HBS) data suggest that 1.9
million people lived in poverty in 2005, down considerably from almost 3.3 million in 2002.
Growth has been pro-poor, with consumption increases o f the poorest decile at twice the
average, see figure 2 in the CPS above. Wages and salaries have increased significantly, with
the minimum wage raised fivefold, albeit from a very l o w level. There has also been
significant surge in transfer incomes for the poorer households. In 2004 government social
transfers increased by over 35 percent among the poorest 20 percent o f the households from
their level in 2003. Pensions, which are the main component o f government social program,
have increased by about 44 percent for the poorest quintile during the same period.

Pillar I:Managing the Oil Boom
Macroeconomic management over the CAS period was commendable. The government was
highly successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability. Despite large and potentially

destabilizing capital inflows, a stable real exchange rate was maintained and inflation was
contained to single digits through most o f the CAS period (table A3.3). External debt fell
from 24 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 15 percent in 2005. Higher revenues and relatively
cautious increases in expenditure yielded an average fiscal surplus o f 0.6 percent o f GDP
between 2002 and 2005. The current account deficit rose sharply, from 1 percent o f GDP in
2001 to 30 percent o f GDP in 2004, due to higher o i l sector imports related to B T C
construction and upstream o i l platform development. However, this deficit was financed by
FDI and the overall balance o f payments recorded a surplus. In 2005 the current account
turned to a surplus o f 1.3 percent o f GDP. Given the increase in gross fixed investment, from
23 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 58 percent in 2004, macroeconomic management has been
remarkable. In late 2004/early 2005, inflation spiked, due in large part to insufficient
flexibility in the exchange rate in the face o f large capital inflows and higher public
expenditures. In the second quarter o f the year, the government, in consultation with the Bank
and the IMF, introduced greater exchange rate flexibility and increased interest rates to bring

64

about a reduction in inflation. An anti-inflation decree with a wide range o f structural
measures was adopted. End-period inflation for 2005 i s estimated at about 5.5 percent.

been published since 2003, in accordance with the new budget law. Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM) classification has been adopted. All SOFAZ expenditures, except
for operating expenditures, are incorporated as part o f the annual consolidated government
budget presented to the Parliament for approval. The Ministry o f Finance publishes quarterly
budget execution statements that include the use o f the Oil Fund. SOFAZ also publishes
quarterly financial statements as well as annual reports audited according to international
standards. Bank advice was provided to strengthen the fiduciary framework for governance in

While good progress has been made, a substantial agenda lies ahead in further
strengthening key institutions. Progress in creating capacity in government auditing has been
slower than expected. The Chamber o f Accounts has been established and staffed, but its

capacity and access to information are limited, restricting the scope o f its activities.
Transparency in procurement practices i s also not yet widespread. Line ministries do not
adequately participate in the MTEF process, and the capacity o f the Public Investment

Appraisal Division needs to be further strengthened. Technical assistance programs in these
areas by a range o f donors are continuing. The real test o f these institutions will come during
the next CPS period, when large-scale revenues begin to flow. Experience suggests the need
for gradual but consistent implementation along with extensive consensus building on reform
issues, many o f which represent substantial shifts from current practices. A long-term time
horizon i s essential, given the multilayered and compartmentalized structure o f government in
Azerbaijan and comparative weakness o f the media and civil society.
Pillar 11: GeneratingJobs and Sustainable Growth outside the Oil Sector
The non-oil sector grew 13 percent a year during 2002-04, far exceeding the benchmark of
5-7 percent a year (table A3.4). Non-oil exports rose from US$259 million in 2002 to
US$766 million in 2005, an average annual growth rate o f 43 percent. Such high non-oil
export growth, l o w inflation, l o w relative wages, and the most depreciated REER in the
region (see box 1 in the CPS), are all strong indications that Dutch disease was avoided during
the CAS period. The Bank and I F C worked closely with the government to support

interventions to improve the business environment, strengthen the financial sector, promote
agriculture, and diversify economic development to the regions beyond Baku. Employment
growth in the construction, transport, and communications sectors was 3-5 percent per year.
With a decline in agricultural employment (which accounts for 40 percent o f the workforce),
however, official data indicate that overall employment grew just 0.4 percent a year.25 A
better measure may be the growth in private consumption, which increased on average by 7-8
percent p.a., while the poorest decile enjoyed twice that growth, see figure 2 in the CPS on
Azerbaijan’s track record o f pro-poor growth. Minimum wages rose almost fourfold between
2002 and 2005 (from $7 to $25 a month), and average wages rose substantially as well. The
result o f these wage increases was to raise the real incomes o f the large majority o f the
population employed outside the energy sector, including teachers and health workers. The
Bank made substantial contributions to growth in the non-oil sector through analytical work,
close policy dialogue, and investments in the financial sector, rural sector, and infrastructure,
as discussed below.

IFC supported local companies by building the capacity of financial institutions and
small and medium-size enterprises. IFC’s advisory work focused on creating opportunities for
local suppliers to the major o i l and gas development projects active in the region. The
centerpiece o f this strategy i s the ACG/BTC Small and Medium-Size Enterprise Linkage
Program, which provides capacity building to local small and medium-size enterprises that do
business with international o i l companies. Other I F C technical assistance included a leasing
development project and a corporate governance program. These programs are working to
improve the country’s overall investment climate through policy dialogue, training and public
awareness campaigns, in addition to increasing investment attractiveness o f local joint-stock
companies and banks.

25

Information o n employment and the labor market in Azerbaijan i s weak. Although labor market issues are a
serious concern in Azerbaijan, where unemployment and underemployment are high, the Bank has had little
success in engaging the government o n these issues and agreeing o n a strategy and work plan.

Despite some progress, continuing efforts are needed to improve the business
environment. Azerbaijan scored better than the average E C A country on 15 o f the 21
“Problems Doing Business” indicators in the 2005 BEEPS. It scored below average on
corruption, business licensing, customs and trade regulations, tax administration, tax rates,
and electricity. At least 25 percent o f respondents identified these areas as problems (other
problem areas included the cost o f and access to finance). Perceptions in each o f these areas
except electricity have worsened since the 2002 survey. This deterioration may be related to
the transition in Presidential power in 2003-2004, and as such transitory. WBI Governance
Indicators show steady progress during the CAS period o n government Effectiveness and
Regulatory Quality, areas where the Bank has influence, while progress in areas where the
Bank has less leverage has been mixed.

At the beginning o f 2005, according to Doing Business, i t took 115 days to start a
business in Azerbaijan-three times as long as in the average country in the Europe and
Central Asia Region. This figure was reduced to 56 days in May 2005, when the regulations
for registering legal entities were streamlined. The cost o f dealing with licenses f e l l from
1,326 percent o f per capita income to 977 percent in 2005, but i s still almost twice the
regional average.

With Bank advisory assistance, the government has begun addressing these issues.26
Income tax on businesses was reduced from 27 percent in 2002 to 24 percent in 2004, taxexempt income was raised by 50 percent, and the three-tier tax system was consolidated into
two tiers. Azerbaijan has joined the Kyoto Convention on Simplification and Harmonization
o f Customs Procedures, and preparatory work has begun to adjust the country’s customs code.
A new anticorruption law has been enacted, and the President has decreed an elaborate State
Programme for Combating Corruption. However, progress has been slow. The FY06 Judicial
Reform project i s helping to strengthen governance in the court system and facilitate citizens
access.
Bank Group AAA included the benchmark annual Doing Business survey, INOTIS, the Trancaucasus Tourism
Initiative IDF (FYOS), and the Trade Facilitation T N p o l i c y notes (FY04). A B a M M F Financial Sector
Assessment Program was completed in 2004.

67

Prudential norms and increased competition have been introduced in the financial
sector. The Bank worked closely with the IMF to help the government encourage
consolidation as well as competition in the financial sector. During the C A S period there have
been significant improvements in the legal and regulatory framework for the banking sector,
as well as in supervisory practices. The new Banking Law and the new L a w in National Bank
o f Azerbaijan were enacted in 2005 and address the key issued identified by the FSAP. A
number o f new prudential regulations in line with B I S standards have been issued, a C A M E L based bank rating systems has been introduced, the prudential reporting systems improved
and there is now systematic off-site surveillance. The quality o f on-site supervision has also
improved. IFRS was implemented in all banks. National standards for banks governance were

established, internal controls and audits strengthened, and a credit reporting system became
operational in M a y 2005.

The Banking sector was characterized by very strong growth, from about U S D 994
million at end 2003 to U S D 3.12 billion in mid-2006. The competition in the banking sector
is increasing, but the dominance o f the state-owned International Bank o f Azerbaijan (IBA)
continues to be a problem (although the dominance has been reduced from 80 percent in 2000
to about 50 percent o f the total banking assets and about 20% o f the total capital as o f mid
2006). In 2003 the 44 private banks had 96 branch offices, while state-owned IBA and Kapital
Bank had 125 branch offices. At end 2005, the number o f branch offices o f private banks had
increased 2.8 times to 270. Efforts to expand access to financial services outside Baku are
moving forward under the new Bank-financed Financial Services Development Project. As
the smaller domestic banks continue to grow and become stronger, the market position o f IBA
i s expected to decline more quickly in the next couple o f years. Furthermore, I B A ’ s previous
monopoly on credit cards has now vanished through the IDA-supported introduction o f a
second card system owned by the association o f private banks. The issue o f the privatization
o f IBA and Kapital Bank remains open. One reason i s that i t has been difficult to find interest
from fit and proper investors.

IFC supported four financial sector projects designed to channel funds to the small
and medium-size enterprise sector. I F C assistance included follow-on credit lines to two local

banks that IFC support has helped transform into sustainable competitive financial institutions
with the capacity to support small businesses. I F C has also provided assistance to the banks to
reduce the risks associated with lending to smaller businesses by implementing credit review
and portfolio management tracking systems and by training branch managers, loan officers,
and credit analysts.
I F C was instrumental in establishing the first and only commercial microfinance bank
in the country, the Micro Finance Bank o f Azerbaijan. IFC’s initial $1.75 million equity
investment and recent additional $3 million loan to the bank has helped built confidence in the
banking sector and introduced commercial micro finance techniques to Azerbaijan. Nineteen
microfinance institutions now operate in the country, with an overall credit portfolio o f $52
million and more than 64,000 active clients, 39 percent o f them businesswomen. The total
amount o f microfinance loans, which range from $100 to $125,000, i s expected to reach $200
million by end-2005.

68

Farm privatization was completed, and rural credit systems are being developed.

Under the Farm Privatization Project, which closed at the end o f 2003, land titling and
registration models were piloted that were subsequently adopted countrywide. The farm
privatization o f the late 1990s i s considered among the most successful in the CIS. With
decentralization o f land transaction services under the Agricultural Development and
Credit Project (ADCP), the number o f registered land transactions reached 10,000 in 2004,
far exceeding the CAS target o f 3,000 transactions a year. The ADCP also supported access to
credit for more than 20,000 rural borrowers, far exceeding the CAS target o f 7,000. While the
credit unions are still young, most show signs o f operational viability. A follow-on ADCP-2
was approved in June 2006, while enlarging the real estate registration to country-wide
coverage was separated out as a self-standing project for FY07 due to its size.
Rehabilitation and construction o f irrigation and drainage infrastructure under two
Bank projects resulted in a significant increase in crop yields in the target areas. A Rural
Investment APL , focusing on community-based management o f infrastructure by rural
communities, municipalities, and water users associations, was also commenced during the
CAS period.
For Azerbaijan these are new concepts that are taking root slowly; the C A S period saw
progress in deepening and broadening recognition and acceptance o f the k e y role o f grassroots
organizations in the rural sector. To facilitate this process, the government adopted new
legislation that simplifies the process o f registering legal entities, including NGOs, and
established a legal registry. Notwithstanding these important achievements, the agenda in the
rural sector remains large, with much work remaining to be done to improve access to credit,
markets, and infrastructure.
Bank AAA in the rural sector included a study o f a marketing and agro-processing
issues and a study o f the rural impact o f utility price changes.
Several initiatives have been undertaken to reduce pollution and strengthen natural
resource management. Azerbaijan’s national environmental priorities were defined in the
1998 National Environmental Action Plan, which has since gained increasing attention from
both the public and the government. The Bank has placed emphasis o n building capacity in
the Ministry o f Environmental and Natural Resources. Although continuing institutional
weaknesses exist, the ministry i s gradually taking a leading role in national policymaking.

Under the regional Caspian Environment Program, a National Caspian Action Plan
was developed that has received strong donor support. The Urgent Environmental
Investment Project helped build a sturgeon fingerling hatchery to help restore the stock o f
sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Six million fingerlings were produced in its first year o f
operation, with an eventual target o f 15 million a year. The project also demonstrated several
onshore oilfield cleanup methodologies and mercury removal methods by cleaning up a
heavily contaminated area.
The Council o f Ministers approved a Hazardous Waste Management Strategy in 2004
to mitigate the environmental impacts o f o i l production. A National Monitoring Department

69

was established to track pollution emissions, and an Agency for Management o f Toxic Wastes
was created to coordinate waste disposal.
Further Bank support is being provided under the Rural Environment Project,
approved at the end o f the CAS period, which focuses on improving forest and pasture
management and biodiversity conservation. Work has also begun o n establishing a
mechanism to address legacy pollution and begin preparation o f a proposed Absheron
Peninsula Environmental Cleanup Project for the next CPS period.
Pillar 111: Improving Infrastructure and Social Services
Azerbaijan is on track to reach most of the MDGs. During the CAS period the MDGs were

largely integrated into the SPPRED (see annex 4). The Bank worked to improve the statistical
basis for benchmarks and monitoring progress in achieving them. A close partnership through
the Programmatic Poverty Assessment strengthened Azerbaijan’s capacity for poverty
analysis.
Notwithstanding this progress, analytical gaps remain, notably the absence o f regular
labor market surveys and insufficient understanding o f the economic status o f internally
displaced people. In health the discrepancy between government statistics and survey data
make i t difficult to determine whether progress i s being made in reducing under-five and
maternal mortality. To achieve the MDG o n ensuring environmental sustainability,
Azerbaijan needs to give higher priority to improving drinking water sources, especially in
rural areas.
Good progress was made in providing free textbooks and piloting student assessment
as steps toward improving access and quality in the education system. The gross primary
education enrollment ratio increased from 98.6 percent in 2001 to 102.4 percent in 2003; the
gross upper secondary enrollment rate rose from 43.2 percent in 2001 to 70.5 percent in 2003.
Higher education enrollment dropped slightly, from 13.4 percent in 2001 to 12.2 percent in

2003.

While CAS targets were broadly met, the education system continues to be plagued by
rigidities, inefficiency, and informal payments. The government has adopted a comprehensive
reform program and appointed an Education Commission to accelerate progress in
implementing the agenda.
The Bank i s continuing to help this process. It approved an Education Sector
Development APL during the CAS period, supported by an Education Sector Note (FY03).
To improve equality in opportunity in basic education, the Bank supported efforts to provide
children in grades 1-5 with free textbooks. (According to government data, this target was
achieved in both 2003 and 2004.) A Department for the Assessment o f Pupil’s Achievement
was established in 2004, and a pilot assessment in math and the Azeri language was
conducted for 1,900 children in grade 5. Under IBTA-2 a study on financing o f education,
public education expenditure, and education priorities was prepared and training in
expenditure analysis was provided.

Primary healthcare service delivery was improved in target areas, although
systemwide reforms are still required. Azerbaijan has taken steps toward reversing the spread
o f tuberculosis by expanding DOTS coverage, and i t s first H I V / A I D S grant funded by the
Global Fund has been approved.

Due to limited government commitment to the broader reform agenda and governance
issues, Bank objectives for the CAS period in the health sector were limited to improvements
in health service delivery in pilot districts.
The H e a l t h R e f o r m LIL was successful in improving access to healthcare services in
five pilot districts. The number o f patients at improved primary health care facilities in the
target districts rose by 65 percent and patient satisfaction rose from 34 percent to 61 percent.
The project was not, however, able to convince key stakeholders to adopt reforms on a wider
scale. Health expenditures rose from 5.3 percent to 5.8 percent o f public expenditures but
there was little rationalization o f expenditures, including right-sizing o f the number o f
hospitals. Although adequately endowed in terms o f facilities and staff, the healthcare system
continues to suffer from very l o w utilization rates, particularly among the poor. Experience in
the health sector to date indicates that little reform can take place without an adequate
governance framework, political will, and buy-in from key institutions involved. When the
leadership in the Ministry o f Health changed in 2005, the Bank was ready. The
comprehensive Health Sector Review (FY05) defined the main elements o f the comprehensive
reform program which are now being pursued through the FY06 Health Sector Reform
project.
Social protection transfer levels were increased and systemic reforms are imminent.
Dialogue on social protection reform advanced significantly during the CAS period,
supported by the Pension and Social Assistance Project, a PSIA o f the Impact of Utility
Price Changes, and intensive work o n poverty statistics and mapping. B o t h pensions and
social assistance payments are being paid o n time and there are no apparent arrears. The

President approved a pension reform agenda to address both policy and administrative
deficiencies. A computerized individual record system for pensioners is being developed and
effective January 1, 2005, the minimum pension amount was increased to AZM 125,000 per
month, equivalent to the minimum wage at the time. Social benefits were also increased. A
new targeted family/poverty benefit scheme was introduced on July 1, 2006. This will also
help compensate for the impact o f planned future utility price increases.

The government ’s strategy toward internally displaced people’s has been increasingly
oriented toward long-term sustainable improvement rather than “temporary” solutions. The

government is increasingly taking the initiative on programs to promote sustainable
livelihoods for internally displaced people . SOFAZ has significantly increased resources to
refigee settlement ($47 million in 2004). Average per capita income among internally
displaced people slightly exceeded the overall population average (table A3.6). Bank
assistance since 1995 was focused through the Pilot Reconstruction Project, which built
transport, energy transmission, and other infrastructure in war-affected areas, enabling about
36,000 internally displaced people to return to their places o f origin. I t also established a
targeted social fund, which has financed about 190 micro-projects, with an average cost o f
about $35,000, for a total o f about 160,000 beneficiaries. In light o f additional IDA resources
becoming available due to improving country performance, the Bank added an FY05 followon internally displaced people Economic Development Support Project, which is scaling
up the social find. There remains, however, a need to better integrate internally displaced
people issues into the overall poverty analysis and sectoral programs and improve data in this
area to gauge progress more clearly.

Transport sector management has been strengthened and rapid development of the
road network is underway. The government has embarked on an ambitious investment
strategy in the transport sector to address critical bottlenecks in developing the non-oil sector
and in improving economic opportunities and access to social services outside Baku.
Significant budgetary resources have been allocated to road development and are being
complemented by strong donor support. The Bank made contributions to institutional
strengthening in the Ministry o f Transport, Highways Administration, and other transport-

related institutions. Budget increases for road maintenance have exceeded the 10 percent a
year target and there has been increasing competition among suppliers and contractors. A
finctional classification o f the road network was completed and a Pavement Management
System to analyze and prioritize road projects has been operational since January 2005. Work
i s underway to rehabilitate sections o f the East-West highway and several rural road
maintenance contracts have been completed under the H i g h w a y Project. The program
provides a balanced approach to: upgrading major highways to 4 lanes; rehabilitating some
national and regional roads; and rehabilitating a part o f the secondary and local network. A
72

second Highway Project for the North-South transit corridor was approved in FY06. W h i l e
good progress i s being made in roads, significant additional investment and maintenance is
required, with 81 percent o f arterial roads still in poor/bad conditions. Moreover, considerable
work remains ahead in other transport sectors, including maritime transport, railroads,
aviation, as well as customs. The 2006 BEEPS reported that the percentage o f f i r m s seeing
transport as a problem doing business has increased since 2002. Through dialogue on trade
facilitation, the Bank helped achieve some progress in developing a publidprivate dialogue on
trade and transport issues and in improving cooperation o n these issues with neighboring
Georgia.27 Regional cooperation on a larger scale i s s t i l l constrained by political factors,
however.
Some steps were taken in reducing energy subsidies, increasing utility tariffs, and
improving water supply in Baku, although the reform agenda in the utility sector remains
large. In energy and other utility sectors, the Bank focused o n structural reform, improving

governance and financial performance, cutting subsidies, and improving the safety and
reliability o f services. According to the 2006 BEEPS, the percentage o f firms seeing
telecommunications and electricity as a problem doing business declined from 9 percent and
30 percent respectively in 2002 to 5 percent and 25 percent in 2005. Progress was made in
removing implicit energy subsidies, both through better collections and through making
indirect subsidies explicit through the budget process. The overall level o f energy-related
subsidies declined from 7.7 percent o f non-oil GDP in 2002 to 6.5 percent in 2004 and i s
projected to further decline to 4.7 percent in 2005. Gas tariffs were quadrupled in 2004 and
water tariffs doubled in order to move closer to cost-recovery. Survey data in Baku show
improvement in drinking water safety, although i t remains a serious concern in other parts o f
the country. Rehabilitation o f the main water treatment plant in Baku under the Baku Water
Supply project i s nearly complete, improving source quality.
Yet, low quality of utility services, lack of metering and inflated norms hampers bill
collections and the financial viability of the companies is questionable. The financial
condition o f the utility sector remains weak and increased metering and an improved
regulatory framework is needed for electricity, gas and water entities to become commercially
sound. Progress toward privatization or increased private sector involvement in utilities has
also been slower than anticipated. Limited data also prevents an accurate assessment o f
improvements in service delivery in the water or energy sectors. There have been no repeats

o f the nationwide electricity blackout o f 2002, but system reliability remains fragile with
frequent localized outages and occasional widespread system failures. The government has
now started very major investments in power generation and transmission. Further
commitment was shown in July 2006, when President Aliyev instructed the Cabinet o f
Ministers to increase collection rates for public utilities within three months at all cost.
September collection rates doubled to 83 percent for gas and 70 percent for water.28 Meters
are rapidly being installed. As mentioned, tariffs were raised significantly for gas and water.
The targeted social safety net started July 1, 2006, which eventually will allow for adjustment

K e y components o f this dialogue included Bank AAA o n Building Competitiveness: An Integrated Non-oil
Trade and Investment Strategy (INOTIS) (FY03) and the Trade and Transport Facilitation Study (FY03).

companies.
Pillar 4: Realizing the Oil Potential
The objective of Pillar 4 was to facilitate and finance oil and gas development, and ensuring
that the projects ’ social and environmental impact is mitigated. Development o f Azerbaijan’s
o i l sector has proceeded on schedule, fueled by some $8 billion in investments during 200205. The A C G Phase 1 upstream project achieved first o i l in February 2005 and i s now

producing approximately 136 thousand barrels o f crude o i l per day. Various factors led to a
delay in the completion o f the extremely complex construction o f the B T C pipeline by more
than a year. The B T C Company began filling the pipeline in Azerbaijan with crude o i l in May
2005. Oil reached Ceyhan by M a y 2006. The first phase development o f the Shah Deniz gas
field i s progressing on schedule and with construction o f the South Caucasus Pipeline gas
exports are expected to commence in 2006. With these developments, the o i l sector is
projected to grow at 60 percent a year during 2005-07. After 2007 growth is expected to
gradually slow and then start declining over the medium to longer term.
The Bank Group played a catalytic role in helping realize the oil potential. The Bank
Group played a key role in helping realize the o i l potential, not just in marshalling financing
for the o i l field project and B T C pipeline development, but also in taking the lead to ensure
maintenance o f the highest social, environmental and safety standards. IFC supported the
second stage o f development o f the A C G Phase 1 o i l field in Azerbaijan and the associated
B T C pipeline in FY04, with loans o f $61.43 million for i t s own accounts and syndicated loans
o f $31 million. IFC has also been instrumental in conducting multi-stakeholder meetings in
the country, convening local people, nongovernmental organizations, and others to hear
concerns about the B T C pipeline’s route and other issues. Regular monitoring o f the project
continues by multiple independent entities including NGO groups in Azerbaijan and IFC’s
environmental and social staff. During the B T C construction, I F C staff accompanied both the
environmental missions (which occurred four times per year) and the social missions (which
occurred twice a year). IFC also interacts o n a regular basis with engineering monitors, who
work on behalf o f the lenders group, and with the Caspian Development Advisory Panel,
which advises BP on their work in the region. A s discussed in the first pillar, IDA played a
major role in helping Azerbaijan put into place adequate institutions for transparency in
revenue tracking and utilization, centered o n the Oil Fund, budget systems, MTEF, and the
PIP. These institutional reforms played a critical role in creating the enabling governance
framework necessary for international o i l companies and banks to commit the long-term,
large-scale financing for the project.
The comprehensive monitoring framework has led to early identification of issues,
which the lenders and civil society have worked with the project to resolve. I F C has also
encouraged B T C to include civil society in the monitoring framework, which B T C has been
able to do so effectively in Azerbaijan. I F C sits on the Steering Committee that reviews
quarterly progress. Furthermore, I F C has dedicated a staff based in Baku identifying,

implementing and monitoring linkages projects under the ACG/BTC S M E Linkage Program.
To date, linkages have included supply chain technical assistance to improve the ability o f
74

potential suppliers to win long-term contracts and access to business services delivered
through the BP Enterprise Center, and the Energy Bus to disseminate information on energysaving and alternative energy technologies (4,486 households participated in the
demonstrations). The program illustrates IFC’s effort to create more opportunities for smaller
local businesses. IFC’s Corporate Citizenship facility has also dedicated $200 thousand in cofunding to help sponsors build the capacity o f civil society in the region.
Although not an explicit objective o f Pillar 4 o f the CAS, a substantial challenge
remains in restructuring SOCAR, which has an equity investment in all o i l and gas joint
ventures in the country, conducts its own production and refining operations, and dominates
the domestic o i l and gas markets. During the CAS period a major corporate restructuring
consolidated SOCAR into 8 divisions from previously 17 1 business units. Several non-core
assets were separated from SOCAR in view o f the preparation o f their privatization. There is
still a need to separate SOCAR’s commercial and regulatory functions and improve the
transparency o f its operational activities and financial reporting. A management company was
hired and has advised SOCAR on implementation o f the action plan. The 2004 Accounting
Law, enacted with the support of the PRSC, stipulates that SOCAR and all other state-owned
enterprises should file and disclose according to IFRS by 2008. While this deadline may be
optimistic, given the complexities involved, good progress i s being made according to
SOCAR’S action plan. T o begin implementation o f an action program on financial and
corporate restructuring o f SOCAR was a high-case trigger o f the CAS, but not a condition for
satisfactory im lementation o f the baseline. Supported by the PRSC, the agreed action plan
got underway.

5. Outcome Assessment and Contribution to Results
Outcome: Satisfactory
The CAS period saw substantial progress in all four strategic directions. Particularly strong
results were seen in the first and fourth pillars: managing the o i l boom and helping realize the
o i l potential. GDP grew an average o f 11 percent per year over the past four years with nono i l GDP growing nearly 13 percent a year; the B T C pipeline i s nearing completion;
development o f gas fields and other pipelines are on schedule; the Oil Fund i s firmly in place;
the budgetary framework i s being implemented; and the government’s commitment to
maintaining high standards o f governance and transparency in the utilization o f its energy
revenues was demonstrated by i t s groundbreaking participation in the EITI, as the first
country in the world to report for 2003,2004 and 2005. Good progress was also made toward
the second and third goals, although progress was slower in some important areas. Sustained
growth was seen in the non-oil sector and progress was made in most areas supported by the
Bank, including banking competition, land market, rural credit, irrigation, and environment.

29 The CAS high-case trigger on SOCAR was also a core conditionality o f the PRSC and was met as a prior
action. See the Azerbaijan PRSC Program Document, April 19, 2005, table 4 on p. 34, and pp.27-29.

Explanation
Commendable macroeconomic management;
substantial improvements in institutions required for
transparent o i l revenue management. The real test o f
these institutions, however, will be in the next CPS
period, when substantial o i l revenues come on
stream.
Sustained non-oil sector growth; good progress in
most areas supported by the Bank, including much
more banking competition and stronger enforcement
o f prudential regulations, as w e l l as progress o n land
market, rural credit, irrigation, and environment.
However, further progress i s needed t o improve the
small and medium-size enterprisehusiness
environment.
Azerbaijan i s on track to meet most o f the MDGs.
Good progress was seen with Bank interventions in
education, social protection reform, and targeted
health care. Systemwide reforms o f the health sector
are n o w underway supported by the Health Sector
Reform project, which was based o n the Health
Sector Study completed during the C A S period.
Road development i s proceeding rapidly; reforms in
energy and utilities are underway with rising tariffs
and collections, and renewed commitment from the
government.
High levels o f investment attracted into oil sector;
allmajor projects on track for completion; oil
growth projected at 60 percent a year over next few
years. Although not an objective o f the C A S
baseline, major SOCAR restructuring took place
and implementation o f IFRS i s underway.

However, considerable work remains t o be done to improve the business environment,
competition in the banking sector, and eliminating corruption in order to fully realize non-oil
growth and employment creation potential. In the social sectors, IDA had significant impact
through the dialogue o n health, pension and social assistance and comprehensive reforms are
underway. The government also strengthened its care t o internally displaced people and began
seeking sustainable solutions to improving their living conditions and economic opportunities.
In the education sector, progress was made in developing new curricula, provision o f free
textbooks, and monitoring education outcomes. Restructuring continued in the water and
energy sectors, although limited progress was made o n increasing private sector involvement.
The government has recently showed renewed commitment in these sectors.

76

Sustainability: Likely
Continued momentum on reforms, underpinned by rising oil revenues makes the sustainability
of these outcomes likely. Primary risks to the sustainability o f achievements to date include a

delay in implementing structural reforms due to non-reformers and vested interests; a
deterioration in financial management as o i l revenues increase dramatically; disruption o f
resource flows due to volatile o i l prices or delays in o i l pipeline construction; and a
deterioration in the political or security environment. Mitigating factors include an active
PRSP process; an emphasis on macroeconomic management, Oil Fund integrity, strategic
long-term o i l revenue management, sound budget preparation processes, and financial
accountability; a SPPREDKPS emphasis on diversifying the sources o f growth and
expanding participation in the economy; broadening dialogue with civil society; commitment
to furthering the democratic process; and a shift toward establishing stable relationships with
neighboring countries. All five projects that closed during the CAS period (Farm
Privatization, Gas Rehabilitation, IBTA, Education Reform and SAC 2) were judged to be
“likely” or “highly likely” to be sustainable by OED.
Bank Performance and Contribution
Strong policy dialogue and closely integrated sectoral lending made substantial contributions
toward advancing Azerbaijan ’s strategic objectives over the CAS period. IDA’S policy
dialogue has been a key facilitator o f change in the country’s transition to a growing market
economy. The Bank Group was able to maintain a constructive dialogue around the PRSCs
even in the absence o f urgent funding gaps. The Bank did not “push through” a financing
package without the government’s demonstrated credibility toward accelerating the reform

agenda. SAC-I1 and PRSC-I provided an integrating and consensus-building platform for a
wide range o f reform measures that would have been difficult to undertake individually.
Reforms were prepared in close collaboration with k e y implementing agencies and managed
to create a new vision and agenda for development as expressed in the SPPRED. Particularly
important was the Bank’s partnership with the IMF and other donors in formulating and
implementing a coherent set o f policies. Such a strategy required a high level o f coordination
among Bank team members in program content, E S W and mission timing. The formula for
success was a tightly knit country team creating synergy and leverage between the high-level
reform agenda and supporting sector projects. Supervision o f SAC-11, for example, was felt as
a responsibility by the whole country team. The Bank and I F C teams managed to build new
relationships and trust between Azerbaijan and the Bank. The Country Office played a crucial
role in the dialogue with the government.
Portfolio performance indicators remained satisfactory throughout the CAS period.

All nine new lending projects targeted for the CAS period were delivered and a tenth project
was made possible by higher performance-based IDA allocations. Altogether, twenty five
projects were active during the CAS period and a satisfactory portfolio status was maintained.
Currently, all projects in Azerbaijan under impiementation are rated satisfactory. The
portfolio disbursement rate was satisfactory, averaging 18-20 percent per year over the CAS
period. O f the six projects that closed during the CAS period, all were rated satisfactory o n
completion except one-the Gas Rehabilitation Project, which was judged successful in
rehabilitating infrastructure in a sustainable manner, but not in promoting the wider reform
77

agenda in the gas sector. Follow up reviews by IEG rated this and two others as
unsatisfactory. In the Education LIL, the project was successful in training in interactive
teaching, but IEG felt that the curriculum development and evaluation components were
unsuccessful. In the Urgent Environment Project, IEG noted that while some urgent physical
targets were met (like the hatcheries) other components were less successful, particularly on
the environmental clean-up. IEG rated Bank performance satisfactory in all projects, except
the Gas Project, in which Bank performance was rated as “unsatisfactory” because o f the
assumption that the project in itself would provide sufficient leverage to carry out gas sector
reforms. N o t until SAC-I1 leveraged high-level policy dialogue did gas sector reform take off.
In addition to the above, all four o f the projects closed in FY06 were rated satisfactory at the
time o f closing, though the IEG review has not yet taken place. All projects and ESW
reviewed by QAG were judged “satisfactory” with the exception o f the Education Sector
Note, in which formal dissemination was assessed as unsatisfactory. The general message o f
completion reviews was that it was important to have a sense o f realism about the pace o f
change and maintain flexibility in implementation. I t was also important to pay attention to
building institutional capacity and to clarify legal and fiduciary responsibilities early on.
A positive shift toward programmatic AAA was made. The C A S period saw a shift in
E S W away from long studies toward shorter programmatic policy notes, produced within a
longer t e r m phased schedule, to provide a basis for a focused and participatory policy
dialogueon key issues. The Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews and Poverty
Assessments are being carried out in the form o f individual modules, tailored with greater
flexibility to the interests and needs o f policy makers. Likewise, the 2004 Energy Study
“Issues and Options Associated with Energy Sector Reform” i s a compilation and synthesis o f
a series o f shorter studies on individual energy sectors and issues that formed the basis for
intensive dialogue with stakeholders in the energy sector. The World Bank Institute focused
on an on-going South Caucasus regional program o n fiscal decentralization and development
o f local government capacity over the past two years and o n PRSP dialogues among the CIS-7
countries.
The Bank collaborated closely with other partners, particularly in structural reform
areas. On the overall reform program there has been close coordination between the Bank’s

support through the SAC-I1 and PRSC and the IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). The fourth review o f the PRGF was completed satisfactorily in December
2004 and the program has come to conclusion in 2005. The ADB, the European Union, and
the IsDB for capacity building provided critical support. The EU TACIS also helped o n
modernizing the taxation system. The Bank worked as one team with U S A I D on Treasury
Systems, PIP and utility regulatory reform and teamed up with U S Treasury on budgetary
reform. The Bank worked closely with EBRD and U S T D A on SOCAR restructuring. The
Bank has also joined with ADB, Switzerland, and UNDP to support the formulation and
implementation o f the SPPRED. The latter has been particularly helpful in integrating the
monitoring o f the M D G s into the recent SPPRED progress report. An intensive three-way
dialogue between the Bank, IMF and the government, and close cooperation supported
achievements in the macro/financial management/governance environment with other donors,
especially the European Union and USAID. See annex 6 for highlights o f this collaboration.

78

Borrower Performance
Prudent macroeconomic management and commitment to implementing the SPPRED were
key factors behind successful outcomes, although reforms in some areas have been slow. The
government has chosen to work with the Bank on furthering reforms, strengthening
governance and accountability, and opening Azerbaijan up to the market economy not
because o f financing needs, but because it feels it benefits from the Bank’s advice. Strong
ownership o f the SPPRED has led to development o f comprehensive reform agendas in a

range o f areas that are being gradually implemented. Azerbaijan’s CPIA ratings rose
significantly over the CAS period. Borrower performance was judged by OED to be
satisfactory or highly satisfactory in all projects closed during the period except for the Gas
Rehabilitation Project. Relatively few problems were experienced with counterpart funding.
In some areas, the pace o f structural reform was somewhat slower than had been hoped for, in
part due to the political transition that took place early in the C A S period. A s a result,
Azerbaijan remained in the Base Case throughout the CAS period, rather than moving into the
High Case. The government and Bank team had hoped that a significant acceleration in the
pace o f structural reforms in the utilities sector and tradebusiness agenda would permit
disbursement o f PRSC-I and an IBRD Energy Infrastructure loan in FY04, and a second
PRSC in 2005. Instead, the reforms moved forward slowly, and the Energy Loan and PRSC-I
only went to the Board at the end o f the CAS period.
More needs to be done to improve project processing and effectiveness and civil
society participation. The government in Azerbaijan remains compartmentalized and
government decisionmaking procedures are complex. As a consequence, project preparation

and negotiations are delayed and there have been some long lags between project approval
and effectiveness, with the r i s k o f undermining timely implementation. The government has
also shown limited acceptance o f international TA, resulting in delays in implementation and
analytical gaps that hamper the monitoring o f performance. As a result, 6 out o f the 8 projects
that have closed or are scheduled to close during the CAS period required extensions. In
addition, implementation in several projects has been delayed by procurement issues and there
i s a need to carefully continue to ensure Bank standards o f transparency in all projects. C i v i l
society development and participation are also lower than in some countries at a comparable
level o f economic development and greater efforts to engage civil society groups in the
development and implementation o f reforms and investment projects are essential.
Exogenous Factors
There were no significant exogenous shocks over the period of the last CAS that affected the
achievement of outcomes. The country benefited from higher than expected o i l prices
throughout most o f the period. A political transition, when President Heidar Aliyev died in
2003 and his son Ilham Aliyev was elected as the new President period impacted the CAS.
The transition resulted in some delays in moving forward with economic reforms, but

President Aliyev’s November 24,2003, Decree and subsequent follow-up has since provided
important impetus to reforms. CAS implementation did not have any unintended negative
impacts that the team i s aware of.

Lessons and Implications for Future Partnership Strategies
Consistent Bank assistance over a considerable time period helped build a consensus and
advance policy and institutional change in Azerbaijan. Continuous and long-term Bank
engagement in policy dialogue combined with related investments and accompanying
technical assistance, helped produce improved governance and transparency in o i l
revenue management as well as significant policy and institutional reforms in a number o f
sectors. Adjustment lending combined with technical support and advisory services
proved particularly effective in helping the government formulate and implement policy
reforms as well as overcome vested interests.
Implications: Stay consistently and constantly engaged in the policy reform agenda over

the medium-term. Continued Bank engagement through policy dialogue can play a pivotal
role in advancing the remaining reform agenda needed for Azerbaijan to consolidate i t s
recent gains and ensure sustainable growth and poverty reduction.

The Bank’s policy dialogue, knowledge, and technical expertise continue to be in demand
in Azerbaijan. The government has recognized that the value o f Bank assistance goes well

beyond the financing involved and welcomes continued Bank support even as energy
revenues rise sharply and Azerbaijan enters Middle Income Country status.
Implications: Policy dialogue as well as technical and knowledge services will
increasingly comprise the Bank’s main value added in Azerbaijan and it should be ensured
that such support i s timely, relevant, and high quality.

The emerging challenge in Azerbaijan is to develop the means to stay fully engaged in the
policy dialogue in the absence of urgent balance of payment needs and PRSC lending.
With a reduced need for balance o f payment lending and the phasing out o f IDA
allocations for Azerbaijan, a key question i s h o w the Bank can continue to stay fully
engaged in the policy dialogue. Unlike some Middle Income Countries, Azerbaijan has a
continued need for structural reforms to accelerate improvements in the business
environment and further encourage growth in the non-oil sectors.
Implications: Develop alternate methods to remain engaged in critical policy issues in the

absence o f PRSC lending, including greater use o f knowledge work as an entry point.
Broad dissemination and greater involvement o f civil society in knowledge-generating
activities can help foster greater understanding and consensus around k e y reform areas.
Close integration of policy and investment lending and a closely knit country team
enhanced the Bank’s effectiveness. A key lesson learned from the Gas Rehabilitation
project was that the investment credit instrument in itself did not provide sufficient

leverage to bring about difficult restructuring and pricing reform. The conditions attached
to SAC-I1 were more effective in tackling such sector issues.
Implications: Ensure close integration o f policy dialogue and investment lending and an
intensive level o f coordination among Bank team members in program content, advice,
and project supervision.
The shqt toward “programmatic” ESW during the CAS period resulted in a series of
timelypolicy notes and workshops. The programmatic approach to E S W has enabled both

80

in-depth “core’ studies as well as shorter, themed or purpose-driven outputs and more
consistent policy dialogue than one-off studies are able to provide. This, for example, has

led to much improved poverty analysis.
Implications: Continue and expand programmatic analytical work to other sectors to
enhance policy dialogue and dissemination o f knowledge.

Complex administrative and decisionmaking procedures in Azerbaijan frequently cause
implementation delays. Projects in Azerbaijan continue t o suffer from undue delays in
project effectiveness and implementation.
Implications: Anticipate administrative and decisionmaking bottlenecks in all activities
and enhance efforts to engage high level facilitators and broad buy-in at all levels to speed
up implementation.
Continued areas of weak information undermine analysis and decisionmaking. In several
areas, such as the health sector and the labor market, the absence o f accurate data
undermines analysis and the establishment o f meaningful objectives and monitoring
indicators.
Implications: Enhance technical and advisory assistance in areas where information
capacity remains weak. A comprehensive review o f the labor market is an important
element o f better understanding and addressing the employment-generation goal.
While regional cooperation and integration has been politically difficult, it w i l l be
increasingly important for the region to sustain growth. Clear economic opportunities
exist in greater regional cooperation and integration, including in energy flows, trade and
transportation. While the region remains politically volatile and continued tensions exist
in some areas, there are signs o f progress toward more stable economic and political
relations among countries in the region, which i s likely to open up significant
opportunities for cross-border interventions.
Implications: Anticipate and prepare for increasing regional integration and at the
appropriate time, engage in regional-level assistance, such as development o f the transit
comdor.

Current status

Prospectsfor achieving Goal by 2015

About 50 percent o f the population o f
Azerbaijan lived in poverty in 2001. In
2005, it i s estimated that 24 percent o f the
population was poor.

Likely. The o i l sector boom, combined
with
broadening
of
employmentgenerating economic activities in non-oil
sectors together with safety nets policies,
would allow Azerbaijan to achieve this
target, probably sooner than 2015.
Likely. The country inherited an education
system that provides nearly universal basic
education. Sector issues relate more to
quality, than to access.

Enrollment rates in basic education
(grades 1-9) are well above 90 percent,
although drop-out rates are higher for the
poor than for nonpoor. Sector concerns
relate more to quality, including the need
to build the skills and knowledge
necessary to meet the challenges o f an
increasingly global economy.
Surveys show no significant gender
differences in enrollment rates for basic
education (grades 1-9). Concerns relate
more to girls’ access to upper secondary
and higher education, particularly in rural
areas.
According to official data, under-five
mortality rate was 23.1 and infant
mortality 12.8 per 1000 live births in
2002). O n the other hand, estimates based
o n surveys indicate that in 1990, the
baseline for the MDG goals, the U5MR
and IMR were 106 and 84 per 1,000 live
births, dropping to 96 and 76, respectively
in 2002. However, for the pilot districts
covered by the Health Reform Project,
UNICEF reports a 13 percent decline
from 73.2 per 1,000 births (2002) to 63.7
per 1000 (2004) in infant mortality, which
if sustained and generalized to the rest o f
the country, would put Azerbaijan back on
track to meet the goal o f 213 reduction by
2015.
M I C Survey (UNICEF) estimates place
maternal mortality at 79 deaths per
100,000 births in 1990, and 94 in 2000.
According to the State Statistical
Committee, the MMR was 19.9 deaths per
100,000 births in 2002, a 52 percent
reduction compared with 37.6 in 2000.

95

Likely. Although girls drop out o f
secondary school earlier than boys and
fewer attend post-secondary education,
especially in rural areas, there i s no
evidence o f gender inequality at the
primary level.
Unlikely.
Assessing
progress
is
complicated by data uncertainties. To
reduce under-five mortality by 213, a 4.4
percent annual reduction i s needed
between 1990 and 2015. Azerbaijan’s
progress has been at only about 0.9 percent
annually
during
1990-2000.
Thus
Azerbaijan i s at risk o f not meeting this
MDG without a concerted effort to
strengthen primary health care and make it
accessible to the poor.

Unlikely. There has been a disconcerting
rise in maternal mortality according to
independent surveys, but a reduction in
MMR according to official data. In the
absence o f comprehensive health sector
reform to improve access and quality in
primary healthcare delivery, it i s unlikely
that Azerbaijan w i l l meet this goal. For
health-related MDGs, problems o f data
collection and definitions have to be
resolved to enable realistic targets and
monitoring.

Current status

Prospects for achieving Goal by 2015

The prevalence rate o f Azerbaijani
citizens infected with HIV i s believed t o
be l o w by regional standards, although
n e w l y reported cases doubled between
1999 and 2000. The actual extent i s not
known because o f limited coverage o f
seroprevalence surveys and lack o f
behavioral surveys.

Likely. Although the prevalence rate i s
considered to b e very low, there are an
estimated 600,000 IDUs in the country
who account for 63 percent o f the cases.
There i s a need for b o t h sero and
behavioral surveillance and greater
attention t o H I V / A I D S prevention and
care. A s o f December 1, 2004 Ministry of
Health has launched the H I V / A I D S project
funded by the Global Fund t o fight
- AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Likely. According t o WHO Global
Tuberculosis Control Program, D O T S
population coverage was 48 percent in
2003. Political commitment and additional
resources are needed t o expand coverage
f r o m the current t o 100 percent in order t o
meet the MDG goal of reversing the
spread.

In 2003 tuberculosis prevalence and
mortality rates were 50 cases and 12
deaths
per
100,000
population,
respectively. Case fatality rate stands at a
high 14 percent. Case detection rate
remains at around 25 percent, m u c h lower
than the international standard o f 7 0
percent, with only a small fraction o f
cases detected through DOTS. The cure
rate was 84 percent, close t o the target o f
85 percent.
According t o available estimates, around
7 6 percent o f a l l households have access
t o an improved drinking water source - 93
percent in urban areas and 58 percent in
rural areas.

Unlikely. Achieving this MDG i s feasible
only if the government gives sufficient
priority to rural water in its public
investment program, consistent with the
SPPRED.

Annex 5
CPS Consultations with Civil Society and Non-Governmental Organizations
CPS priorities were discussed with a large and diversified set o f representatives o f
the c i v i l society during two rounds o f public consultations. Participants were invited to
share their views and visions o n the perspectives o f development processes in the country
as w e l l as ask questions if any.
Participants expressed their great interest in the meetings and raised questions and
concerns regarding Bank activities in Azerbaijan, as well as provided information o n their
o w n activities. Comments and feedback received during the meetings covered both general
and specific areas o f the Bank’s current and potential involvement in this country.

In view o f all participants, the W o r l d Bank plays an important role in helping the
development process move and i t s presence in Azerbaijan adds credibility to the reforms
carried out by the government.
I t was also mentioned that at this point, where the country i s at a crossroads given
the rapidly rising o i l revenues, Bank should continue to provide its expertise and technical
assistance o n the management o f revenues and expenditures since cooperation with the
Bank i s critical to ensure good practices in governance are put in place.

At the same time, the Bank should think o f a more effective way to work with NGOs.
Participants reiterated the importance o f increased involvement o f NGOs in design and
implementation o f Bank-funded projects as well as in assessment o f their results.

A general concern i s that projects should be w e l l monitored in order t o ensure
effective and efficient use o f funds. A general wish expressed was that the Bank improve
the quality and availability o f socio-economic data and information o n project results and
their assessment in the Azerbaijani language.
The representative o f the National NGO Coalition dealing with EITI raised the
fundamental question o f how to engage the c i v i l society as an essential party to policy
making.
Representatives o f the c i v i l society organizations generally expressed appreciation
o f their involvement in the preparation o f SPPRED but complained about little
involvement o f NGOs during its implementation. They also feel that the C i v i l Society
Organizations are not adequately involved in the implementation as well as impact
monitoring o f the Bank-fundedprojects in Azerbaijan. As meeting participants particularly
underlined, i t would be a valuable instrument for the development and capacity building o f
c i v i l society in the country. They were also wondering if there i s any independent review
o f the Bank funded projects in Azerbaijan to ensure the transparency and accountability for
the proper usage o f the credit funds.

97

Among the areas, which need attention o f the international organizations and
should be prioritized for their involvement, several participants particularly indicated the
health sector o f the country, which was identified as problematic, as health outcomes are
raising increased concern. The education sector was also mentioned as not very successful
and requiring additional attention. The participants recognized the difficulties o f working
with the relevant ministries and persuading them to involve NGOs more in their sectors.
Several participants also underlined the importance o f municipal development and
increasing cooperation between NGOs/municipalities and government structures to fight
poverty and ensure economic growth o f the country
One o f the NGOs working in ecological sector expressed concern with the lands
deterioration at the areas where B T C i s constructed and requested to forward their concern
to the IFC.
Participants suggested that the Bank should put a stronger emphasis o n addressing
governance issues by encouraging the government to put in place structural reforms such
as separation o f commercial and regulatory functions o f ministries, setting better
monitoring mechanisms, and promoting participatory approaches to decision making. The
latter would be facilitated by institutionalizing and including adequate budget allocations
for the government’s support to NGOs.
Domestic trade should be an area o f the Bank’s attention.
Development o f rural infrastructure, especially in remote and mountainous areas i s
vital for stimulating economic activity o f communities. Alternative sources o f energy, such
as windmills and bio-energy can be a solution when addressing energy efficiency. Access
to clean water and irrigation i s another area emphasized during the meeting.
Participants suggested that the Bank continues assistance to the financial sector by
promoting banking in rural areas, in particular by supporting those banks that have
branches in remote areas.
Other areas that were emphasized as deserving the Bank assistance were small and
medium-size enterprises. Local entrepreneurs see the Bank’s role as a supporter o f the
institutional development including legal framework, improved corporate governance and
promoter o f better business and economic education and R&D. The Bank i s expected to
advocate for a business environment free o f harassment, corruption and monopolies.
Notwithstanding the energy resources, Azerbaijan i s an agrarian country and
therefore, participants said, i t i s crucial to invest in this sector. The Bank could concentrate
o n supporting agro-processing and also provide assistance to Azerbaijani entrepreneurs in
their efforts to integrate with international markets

98

With large government spending and the Bank’s investments in the non-oil sector,
it i s vital that the Bank helps improve institutional management and build capacity, two

important elements o f a successhl change. Qualified professionals in the key sectors and
good management skills are already in high demand both by the public and the private
sector.
Several participants mentioned the importance o f a comprehensive approach to the
development o f particular sectors and the Bank’s investment operations.
The last but not the least comment was that all operations should be gender
sensitive and target women as important beneficiaries o f Bank-funded projects.

99

Annex 6
Collaboration with Development Partners

The Bank i s collaborating closely with other development partners, particularly in
structural reform areas. On the overall reform program there has been close coordination
between the Bank’s support through the SAC-I1 and PRSC and the IMF-supported Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The fourth review o f the PRGF was completed
satisfactorily in December 2004 and the program has come to conclusion in 2005. The
ADB, the European Union, and the IsDB for capacity building provided critical support.
The EU TACIS also helped on modernizing the taxation system. The Bank worked as one
team with U S A I D on Treasury Systems, PIP and utility regulatory reform and teamed up
with U S Treasury on budgetary reform. The Bank worked closely with EBRD and U S T D A
on SOCAR restructuring. The Bank has also joined with ADB, Switzerland, and UNDP to
support the formulation and implementation o f the SPPRED. The latter has been
particularly helpful in integrating the monitoring o f the M D G s into the recent SPPRED
progress report. An intensive three-way dialogue between the Bank, IMF and the
government, and close cooperation supported achievements in the macro/financial
management/governance environment with other donors, especially the European Union
and USAID. Highlights o f this collaboration over the CAS period include the following:
Macroeconomic management and public expenditure. The Bank will continue to work
closely together with the IMF. On Treasury modernization, the Bank i s financing
computerization together with USAID. The Bank i s also coordinating with U S A I D on
its Public Investment Policy and Efficiency (PIPE) project, which i s supporting
improvements o f capital budget formulation, investment project preparation, and longterm budget planning at the Ministry o f Economic Development and selected line
ministries. The U.S. Treasury i s supporting a long-term engagement with the Ministry

o f Finance on improving the budget preparation process and moving toward program
budgeting.

Financial sector. IDA and the IMF collaborated closely on the preparation o f the 2005
Financial Sector Assessment Report; this collaboration will continue with
implementation support o f the FSAP recommendations. U SAID i s providing support
for banking supervision. KfW i s playing an important role in supporting the Credit
Guarantee Fund and Deposit Insurance. It is expected that the European Union will
support the strengthening o f anti-money laundering legislation and institution building.
Accounting. The Bank and IFC have cooperated closely with the ADB and the
European Union in the context o f the recent Accounting and Auditing ROSC, which is
being finalized. The European Union, the Bank (including the IFC), the IsDB, and
USAID are working very closely in supporting accounting reforms and the
implementation o f the new accounting law. The Bank used Consultant Trust Funds

made available by Canada and Switzerland to extend assistance to policymakers,
regulators, and private sector stakeholders in enhancing financial reporting and internal
control systems in Azerbaijan.

100

3+ Anticorruption. The Bank will work closely with the European Commission on
corruption as i t s ENP Action Plan crystallizes. I t i s expected that the European
Commission will include specific actions to strengthen enforcement and assess the
impact and progress o f the Anticorruption L a w in force since January 2005 and the
state program on fighting corruption, which is closely related to the policy framework
supported by the CPS. The European Union i s expected to play a leading role in
simplifying and streamlining customs and tax legislation and procedures in line with
EU and international standards.

>

Judicial reform. Several donors are working with the Ministry o f Justice and the courts
in the areas o f law drafting, procedural reforms, and training o f judges. The Council o f
Europe and European U n i o n are working on law drafting, the selection and hiring o f

100 additional judges, and development o f supervision systems. U S A I D and GTZ are
working o n training. The American Bar Association Central European and Eurasian
L a w Institute (ABA CEELI) i s working on legal education and information, judicial
training on ethics and commercial law, and alternative dispute resolution (ADR).
Preliminary consultations indicate that donors are not fully satisfied with the
institutional capabilities or infrastructure o f judicial institutions to actually implement
many o f the law and human rights reforms that have been initiated and approved in
recent years with their assistance. IDA will collaborate closely with donors (including
the Netherlands, the International Committee o f the Red Cross, OSCE, the Eurasia
Foundation, and Soros Foundation) on the implementation o f judicial reform and
training activities.

>

Agriculture. IDA i s coordinating its agricultural program with USAID, the ADB, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and GTZ, which are
providing credit to agricultural producers, supporting small and medium-size
enterprises, and working to increase the competitiveness o f rural enterprises. U S A I D is
supporting three programs that provide support to small and medium-size enterprises
and farmers to improve linkages to markets. I t i s launching a program to strengthen
microfinance institutions in rural areas. The ADB i s planning a new project to support
micro-finance institutions (MFIs) in nonurban areas through the provision o f a credit
line. IDA i s working with the European Union Food Security program and TACIS o n
coordinating activities in the agricultural sector. The development o f rural areas and
collaboration, especially in the areas o f food safety, have been discussed. IDA i s
coordinating activities related to real estate and cadastre development with the ADB,
KfW, and SDC. The second phase o f the ADCP will coordinate closely with all

stakeholders on their areas o f involvement.

P Health. IDA is coordinating with UNDP and UNICEF on establishing family clinics

and district health programs. GTZ i s enhancing the national health monitoring system.
USAID/Caucasus-Azerbaijan has started a new $5 m i l l i o n project that focuses o n
redefining and restructuring primary health care with improved financing and resource
allocations in order to improve service quality. Other USAID-funded programs include
the Child Survival Program (Mercy Corps) and the Reproductive Health and Family
Planning (ACQUIRE). U S D A i s supporting primary health care (via ADRA) and a

101

HIV /AID program (via IRD). U N I C E F is planning to continue its activities in safe
motherhood, neonatal care, nutrition, and H I V / A I D S prevention and care. I t is also
supporting overall health sector reform within the SPPRSD framework. A United Aid
for Azerbaijan project i s supporting early intervention services, and the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) i s implementing a reproductive health program. The Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis has granted the Ministry o f Health $6
million for a HIV/AIDS project, and further fhnding i s being considered for malaria
and tuberculosis. G O P A K f W has been involved in implementing DOTS for
tuberculosis treatment in Azerbaijan. Further tuberculosis screening and follow-up i s
needed to strengthen integrated primary health care services and epidemiology and
sanitary control. The World Health Organization will be providing technical assistance
to the Ministry o f Health on primary health care, health policies and strategies, health
financing, tobacco, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis programs, and immunization.

P Education. The ADB has launched an early childhood development project. The Soros
Foundation i s complementing the IDA program in providing support for early

childhood development. The Open Society Institute and BTC/SCP are implementing a
rural inclusive education program to integrate children with special needs into
mainstream kindergarten and primary classes. The Japanese government has provided a
grant for building and rehabilitating primary schools. JBIC i s preparing a project on
secondary vocational education development. The Saudi Fund has financed the
construction o f five secondary schools in Baku. U S A I D i s considering a grant project
in secondary and tertiary education. UNICEF, U S A I D and SDC are involved in the
sector through civic education, voter education, and youth projects.

P Social protection. In close coordination with IDA, UNDP will maintain its support to
the Social Protection Fund for establishing the system o f individual accounts until the
end o f 2006. The EU TACIS and Food Security programs are planning to continue
their support to the ministry o f labor and social protection in implementing targeted
social assistance. These projects are s t i l l being developed.
P Internally displaced people. IDA and the ADB are working together to help improve
the economic opportunities o f internally displaced people and integrate them into
society. Their efforts partially complement the more immediate humanitarian support
provided by U N H C R (shelter) and the World Food Program (food security).
P Infrastructure. Several donors are currently supporting different parts o f the NorthSouth and East-West road corridor modernization including ADB, EBRD, IDB,
Kuwait Fund, OPEC Fund, and the Saudi Fund. In view o f its substantial involvement
in the sector, the Bank will provide overall leadership and coordination in the transport
area as recently agreed with ADB. EBRD and ADB technical assistance i s coordinated
with and continues the Bank’s technical assistance program started with the Azerbaijan
Highway Project. The Bank’s support for the water sector i s complemented by support
provided by ADB and KfW o n water supply in secondary towns and rural areas. ADB
i s working on an integrated and comprehensive urban planning approach in three
provincial cities. With regard to the energy sector the Bank i s working closely with

102

EBRD o n SOCAR restructuring and major upstream and pipeline investments. The
Bank i s taking the lead on donor coordination in this sector.

Recurrent cost financing i s expected to remain

aggregate fiscal position and prospects, and i t s
implications for recurrent cost financing. In
determining Bank financing o f recurrent costs
in individual projects, the Bank will take into
account sustainability issues at the sector and
project levels, including implied future
budgetary outlays.

Local costfinancing
Are the requirements for Bank financing:
financing requirements for the country’s
development program would exceed the
public sector’s own resources (for example,
from taxation and other revenues) and expected domestic borrowing; and the
financing o f foreign expenditures alone
would not enable the Bank to assist in the
financing o f individual projects.

Yes

The criteria for Bank financing o f local costs
are met. The Bank may finance local costs in
the proportions needed in individual projects.

Taxes and duties
Are there any taxes and duties that the Bank
would not finance?

None

There are no taxes and duties that are judged
to be unreasonable. At the project-level, the
Bank would consider whether taxes and duties
constitute an excessively high share o f
projects costs.
