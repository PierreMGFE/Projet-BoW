COUNTRY ASSISTANCESTRATEGY FOR
THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH

EXECUTIVE SUMMAFtY

i.
Bangladesh has recorded impressive economic and social gains since the 1990s. The country
has doubled per capita growth and taken large strides toward reaching some Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Values on key social indicators are much better than would be
predicted for a country at i t s income level. These gains have occurred despite widely held
perceptions o f poor governance. Bangladesh scores low on most global governance indicators, and
investors rank corruption among their most serious concerns.
ii.
How h a s Bangladesh done so well despite such poor governance? Explaining this
conundrum requires unbundling governance, recognizing both successes and failures. Bangladesh
has seen slow but steady gains in public accountability, with successive free elections, an
increasingly assertive Supreme Court, a rapidly growing and active civil society, and a relatively free
media. The state has encouraged the emergence o f a vigorous private sector through sound
macroeconomic management and trade liberalization. Financial sector governance i s improving, and
successive governments have allocated public resources wisely, emphasizing pro-poor expenditures.
Governments have made room for and forged strong partnerships with NGOs, which have
contributed to the impressive development gains. On the other side are the governance failures. The
increasingly unhealthy competition and lack o f trust between the two major political parties sours the
political climate and i s a major governance weakness. The high cost o f elections feeds public
corruption. An overly centralized state reduces public accountability in the delivery o f services. An
inadequate revenue effort and weak public financial management undermine the effectiveness o f
pro-poor spending policies and foster corruption. A weak civil service and justice sector compromise
the delivery o f essential services, including law and order.

THEGOVERNMENT’S
PRSP AND DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES
iii.
The Government’s recently completed Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
“Unlocking the Potential,” recognizes that despite past gains, a large unfinished agenda remains.
Some 63 million people live in deprivation, two-thirds o f these in extreme poverty. Inequality i s
rising. Adult illiteracy i s persistent. Malnutrition levels and maternal mortality ratios are among the
highest in the world. Attaining the MDGs calls for accelerating economic growth to 6-7 percent a
year. This will not be easy. Garment exports, three-quarters o f all exports, are vulnerable to
competition from low-cost producers now that the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) has come to an
end. The availability o f cultivable land i s declining. Accelerating growth w i l l require higher
investment levels-to
aid diversification into areas o f comparative advantage and to finance
infrastructure-and higher productivity. This in tum calls for a substantial improvement in the
investment climate, harmed by perceived high levels o f corruption and lack o f transparency.
Attaining the social development goals w i l l require accountable and responsive social service
delivery systems that reach the poor. Raising productivity and reaching the more difficult goals for
maternal mortality and malnutrition w i l l require improving the quality o f education and health
services. And this w i l l require improving institutional accountability and incentive structures, s t i l l
very weak as a result o f a poorly functioning and overly centralized bureaucracy operating within
one o f the most centralized countries in the world. These gains in quality w i l l also depend on
improvements in the quality o f local governance. Improvements in the investment climate and
service delivery also require stronger core governance. The modest revenue effort needs to be
enhanced, and public financial management, including procurement, strengthened to reduce
leakages. And greater public access to information will be needed if civil society and the public are

i

to hold government accountable for service delivery. As the PRSP puts it, “a major thrust o f the PRS
has to be on ensuring good governance”.’

THEWORLD BANKGROUP’S
ASSISTANCESTRATEGY
iv.
This assistance strategy i s aligned with the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, with
governance as the core focus across that strategy’s two pillars: improving the investment climate and
empowering the poor. T h e Bank Group’s program w i l l address sector governance issues in both
pillars, as well as core governance issues. This mainstreaming o f governance implies that all Bank
Group interventions w i l l be as much about governance as they w i l l be about improving sector
performance. While the focus on governance w i l l be broad, the Bank w i l l selectively support
meaninghl reforms in key high-priority areas, highlighted below, where progress i s both important
and possible.

Pillar 1: Improving the Investment Climate. The Government’s strategy as laid out in the PRSP
has two primary aims: First, to ensure a stable macroeconomy and enabling business environment by
improving trade policies, enhancing the legal and regulatory environment for the private sector,
developing an effective competition policy, establishing policies friendly to foreign direct
investment, and deepening financial sector reforms. Second, to strengthen sectors critical to pro-poor
growth, including agriculture, infiastructure, water resource management, and information and
communication technology. The Bank Group w i l l build on Bangladesh’s strengths by continuing to
help maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate i t s progress toward an open, market-based
economy. At the same time i t w i l l help the Government address weaknesses in the investment
climate by removing the significant policy and institutional constraints to infrastructure provision
and improving i t s weak regulatory quality. The principal focus will be to improve governance and
eJjciency in infrastructure by reducing opportunities for cormption and nontransparent
procurement practices. The Bank Group w i l l help improve the policy environment for energy
development by strengthening the institutional framework, addressing distorted pricing, and
encouraging accountable and transparent processes that reduce political interference in investment
decisions. The Bank Group w i l l also help address governance and institutional constraints facing the
transport sector while i t helps remove bottlenecks in the primary road network and supports
improvements in the main transport corridor.
Pillar 2: Empowering the Poor. The PRSP calls for improving the quality o f services while seeking
to attain and improve on the MDGs. The World Bank w i l l build on Bangladesh’s impressive social
gains by helping the Government meet the MDGs while also enhancing the quality and efficiency o f
social service provision to the poor by strengthening sector governance and accountability and
enhancing voice and participation. A principal new thrust o f the Bank’s strategy w i l l be in local
governance. The World Bank, working with i t s development partners, w i l l attempt to enhance
accountability by helping citizens participate in decisionmaking and hold service providers to
account. I t w i l l help clarify the assignment o f roles, responsibilities, and resources to local
governments to allow them to respond to community priorities, strengthen the capacity o f
communities to hold their governments to account, and support capacity development in core
functions aimed at strengthening accountability and transparency. It w i l l also enhance voice and
participation through additional community-driven development (CDD) operations.
Core Governance. The principal focus in core governance w i l l be to increase transparency
and accountability and reduce opportunities for corruption. Priority w i l l be given to improvingpublic
financial management and procurement. The Bank w i l l support a strategic development plan aimed
at modernizing and reengineering the National Board o f Revenue to reduce cormption and improve
tax collection. The Bank i s also working with the Government to develop and implement a
comprehensive, time-bound public financial management plan, including a deepening o f the

promising initial refonns o f public procurement. The Bank and i t s development partners w i l l support
the strengthening o f key institutions o f accountability, helping to create a transparent, fair, and
independent process for selecting the leadership and senior management o f these agencies, ensuring
their independence, and ensuring adequate compensation commensurate with their responsibilities
and special status. Active engagement with civil society and strategic partnerships are planned to
help strengthenthis focus on improving accountability.
vi.
The Bank’s interventions in core governance reflect i t s comparative advantage and mandate.
But the roots o f the governance crisis in Bangladesh l i e mainly in i t s political institutions. Thus
addressing this crisis requires reforming election finance, strengthening political parties (including
through intraparty democracy), improving the quality o f political competition, and increasing the
effectiveness o f Parliament as a key institution. The Bank Group intends to rely on i t s bilateral
development partners to help Bangladesh address these issues.

vii.

Longer-Term Strategic Issues. The potential fallow period as Bangladesh enters i t s
election cycle creates an opportunity to take an integrated view o f longer-term development
challenges, including environmental issues, spatial development, urbanization, institution building,
and regional integration in Asia. The Bank w i l l work with think tanks, civil society, and i t s
development partners on these issues to help shape policy priorities in the next PRSP.

DELIVERINGTHE WORLD BANKGROUPPROGRAM

viii. T h i s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared following extensive internal
reviews and external consultations. Drawing on the lessons learned, the Bank Group will do many
things differently in Bangladesh. It w i l l pay more attention to results. It w i l l make governance the
central focus o f i t s work and i t s guide in allocating resources. It w i l l systematically involve
beneficiaries and affected communities in i t s operations. I t w i l l build strong partnerships with
donors, academia, and civil society in support o f i t s development agenda. It w i l l operate in an open
and transparent way and try to be a reliable long-term development partner o f Bangladesh. And it
w i l l strengthen fiduciary safeguards and proactively manage i t s portfolio.
ix.
World Bank Lending Instruments. Bangladesh’s allocation o f International Development
Association (IDA) resources for FY06 i s $750 million, based on i t s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) rating, i t s portfolio performance, and the adjustment for the “governance factor”
integral to the performance-based allocation formula under the 14th replenishment o f IDA resources
(IDA14). Similar lending levels are assumed for h t u r e years. This level o f resources will allow the
Bank to follow a strategy o f strong engagement, including through annual development policy loans.
The Bank’s lending program w i l l be substantially influenced by the enhanced focus on governance.
Development Support Credits w i l l emphasize improvements in sector and core governance, and
access to these credits w i l l be conditioned on governance-relatedbenchmarks. Investment projects in
a particular sector w i l l focus on the key governance constraints in that sector, while others will
support improvements in local governance, financial management, and procurement. In addition, the
Bank w i l l increasingly rely on CDD operations that directly empower the poor. The Bank’s program
o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA) w i l l also be managed more strategically to support
governance reforms.
x.
I F C and MIGA Programs. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), with a current
portfolio o f $132.5 million in nine projects, expects to continue to provide direct support to the
private sector, with a special emphasis on infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing sector projects.
IFC will also support the development o f local capital markets and a competitive banking sector. The
South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) will continue to provide technical assistance to
financial intermediaries, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and professional service f i r m s
that support SMEs. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), with an exposure o f
$112 million in five contracts, plans to support foreign investors in telecommunications,

...

111

infrastructure, and natural resources and provide technical assistance to the Board o f Investment and
support to the Export Processing Zones Authority.
xi.
Managing the Bank’s Fiduciary Risk The Bank w i l l implement a rolling Operational Risk
Mitigation Plan now being developed for implementation. The plan w i l l comprise several key
building blocks: carrying out, through AAA and in project preparation, a systematic analysis o f
corruption risk in sectors o f potential engagement; designing smart projects that reduce corruption
risks; strengthening supervision efforts, including through a systematic annual review o f projects
assessed to be at high fiduciary risk; more rigorously pursuing the remedies open to the Bank when
corruption i s found; and enhancing the disclosure o f information that would facilitate oversight o f
project implementation by civil society and beneficiaries.

xii.
Partnerships, Aid Coordination, and Harmonization. The Bank Group has prepared this
CAS jointly with three o f Bangladesh’s largest development partners, the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), and Japan. This
joint CAS reflects agreement on the country context, the outcomes the four partners would
collectively like to support, and the strategies needed to attain these, and ensures that the partners’
separate business plans complement rather than compete with one another. This partnership i s
supportive o f current efforts to harmonize donor activities around a Government-led development
strategy and government systems. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Implementation Forum o f
November 2005 was chaired by the Government and i s now part o f an annual process to monitor
implementation o f the PRSP. The Government w i l l also undertake periodic progress reviews with
the Local Consultative Group. The Bank w i l l develop strong partnerships with civil society,
academic institutions, and the private sector, working with them to help forge consensus on difficult
issues relating to governance or other contentious policy matters and encouraging them to contribute
to the Bank’s AAA and lending activities as appropriate.
xiii.
Implementing the CAS. Doing business differently w i l l require changes in staffing,
institutional processes, and culture. Staffing adjustments w i l l start with strengthening the governance
focus and credentials o f core members o f the country team. To manage fiduciary and implementation
risks, the operations adviser in Dhaka w i l l chair an Operations R i s k Mitigation Team that w i l l help
implement the Operational Risk Mitigation Plan. Cultural change will prove the most difficult.
Implementing the CAS effectively w i l l require cross-sectoral work, stronger country team alignment
on acceptable risks, and a common understanding o f expectations relating to governance within
projects and AAA. The process o f change will require persistence and continuous effort, as well as
management attention to the incentives facing country team members.

RISKS AND MITIGATION

xiv.
Meeting the CAS objectives involves significant risks that the Bank Group w i l l need to
address. The most severe i s the risk o f a significant worsening in the political climate and in the lawand-order situation as the country enters i t s election cycle. The Bank Group w i l l proactively monitor
the situation and use the midterm review o f the CAS to adjust the assistance strategy. Moreover,
there may be little political appetite to address the reforms in governance that are central to the
success o f this strategy. The Bank Group will need to work with i t s partners to engage key reformers
on both sides o f the political divide to mitigate this risk. Other risks include weak implementation
capacity, a deceleration o f Bangladesh’s exports o f ready-made garments in a post-MFA world, and
natural disasters. The assistance strategy i s directed at addressing these risks. Finally, for the Bank
Group itself, the most serious risks are fiduciary and reputational r i s k s from the corrupt environment
in which the Bank’s operations must be implemented. As discussed, the Bank has prepared a strong
strategy to address t h i s risk, which w i l l require careful and dedicated implementation.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR
THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH

1.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bangladesh was discussed by the World
Bank’s Board o f Executive Directors on December 12, 2000, almost ten months before national
elections and in a CAS Progress Report in June 2003, after the new government completed the
country’s interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The new government, which came to
power in October 2001 after the third successive and largely peaceful elections since Bangladesh
reemerged as a democracy, successfully restarted reforms on critical fronts while ensuring sound
macroeconomic and fiscal management. This good performance enabled Bangladesh to move from
the CAS’S low case to the base-case lending scenario in FY03, and the Bank Group initiated a
strategic shift, reengaging in critical sectors and providing programmatic development policy lending
to support implementation o f the reform program. Accordingly, the first Development Support
Credit (DSC) was approved in June 2003. The three DSCs approved thus far have complemented a
four-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), also approved in June 2003.

2.

Deepening t h i s strategic shift, the FY06-09 CAS aims to align World Bank Group assistance
with the recently completed PRSP (discussed by the Board in January 2006 along with the Joint Staff
Advisory Note). The PRSP reflects the country’s vision for “unlocking the development potential” o f
Bangladesh, a potential amply demonstrated by the remarkable socioeconomic progress made in the
past two decades despite serious governance challenges. To accelerate poverty reduction, the PRSP
i s strategically built on a policy triangle o f pro-poor growth, humandevelopment, and governance. In
line with the goals and priorities o f the PRSP, this CAS aims to help Bangladesh improve i t s
investment climate and empower the poor while placing governance at center stage, simultaneously
addressing key sector governance issues in both CAS pillars and cross-cutting core governance
issues and institutions.

3.
To promote the coordination and harmonization o f aid and increase development
effectiveness, the World Bank Group has prepared t h i s CAS jointly with the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), and Japan.
The joint effort has been framed by a common understandingo f the PRSP and by agreement on both
a common set o f broad outcomes and the strategies needed to help Bangladesh achieve these
outcomes. Because o f institutional requirements, each partner has developed i t s own assistance
strategy document, including complementary country programs for analytical and advisory services,
technical assistance, and lending.
4.
Ths CAS puts a greater emphasis on results, and a common results framework has been
developed as part o f the joint effort, including indicators and milestones for outcomes consistent with
the PRSP. Implementation o f the PRSP faces several challenges, and the “joint results matrix”
recognizes these. Given the difficult political environment in Bangladesh, the Government has had to
pursue reforms opportunistically. The CAS takes into account the national elections expected to take
place in early 2007, recognizing that as this date approaches, implementation o f the reform agenda,
and o f development programs and projects, will become increasingly difficult, with a new window
for intensified reform emerging only after a new government takes office.

I.
A.

THE COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENTPOLITICALDEVELOPMENTS

5.
The period since the last Country Assistance Strategy has been an eventful one. A fourparty alliance led by the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) has been in office since October 2001.
After elections considered by international observers to be free and fair, the BNP-led alliance
replaced the incumbent government, coming to power with a two-thirds majority in a 300-seat

Parliament. BNP had a popular mandate to tackle corruption, improve law and order, and reenergize
the reform agenda. I t s tern1 in office, however, has been characterized by a further worsening in i t s
relations with the main opposition party, the Awami League, leading to prolonged opposition
boycotts o f Parliament, fi-equent hartals (work stoppages), and, more recently, political violence. All
this has contributed to the increased turbulence o f politics in this young democracy. Moreover, in
recent months a number o f ominous terrorist incidents have occurred, purportedly inspired by a
banned organization in support o f the imposition o f shariah (Islamic law) in secular Bangladesh.

6.
The political environment may become more difficult as the country approaches i t s fourth
consecutive democratic elections, which should take place in early 2007. The current govemment
completes i t s term in office in October 2006 and, as required by the Constitution, a caretaker
government should be appointed within 15 days o f the dissolution o f Parliament. The caretaker
government, headed by a chief adviser with all the powers o f the prime minister: should, together
with the Election Commission, ensure that the elections are free and fair.

B.

ECONOMICAND SOCIAL PROGRESS

7.
I n the context of such turbulent politics, along with poor initial conditions and
vulnerability to natural disasters, Bangladesh’s achievements in economic and social
development have been remarkable. The countq has achieved steady economic growth o f 4-5
percent annually, relatively low inflation, and fairly stable domestic debt, interest, and exchange
rates. This growth pedomance, coupled with an impressive decline in the population growth rate
from 2.5 percent in the 1980s to 1.7 percent in 1990-2004, has led to a doubling o f annual per capita
GDP growth, from 1.6 percent in the 1980s to 3.3 percent in 1990-2004 (t.able 1). In per capita GDP
growth Bangladesh outperformed both IDA-only countries (1.8 percent) and low-income countries
(3.0 percent) in the later period. This growth record was accompanied by lower volatility due in part
to the diminishing severity o f the impact o f natural di~asters.~

M o r e important, Bangladesh has taken large strides toward achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The country has outperformed most low-income countries on a range
o f social indicators. I t increased gross primary enrollment from 72 percent in 1980 to 98 percent in
2001 and has already attained the MDG o f eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary
enrollment. With the sharp decline in infant mortality from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 46 in
2003, and in child mortality from 239 per 1,000 to 69, Bangladesh i s set to achieve the targeted twothirds reduction from 1990 levels by 2015. Food security has improved markedly, even for the very
poor. There have also been steady gains in income poverty; the share o f the population in poverty
declined from 59 percent in 1990 to 50 percent in 2000, with the m a l sector accounting for nearly
four-fifchs o f this decline. Bangladesh’s actual values for fertility, infant and child mortality,
contraceptive prevalence, and crude birth and death rates are much better than would be predicted for
a country at i t s income level (table 2).

GOVERNANCE
CONUNDRUM

9.
Bangladesh’s remarkable economic and social gains have taken place despite widely
held perceptions of weak governance. Perceptions-based governance indicators prepared by staff at
the World Bank Institute, which aggregate data from a number o f survey-based indices, reveal low
ratings for Bangladesh on six key indicators, with particularly poor ratings on control of comption,
regulatory quality, and rule of law (box 1). In addition, a recent investment climate survey o f 1,001
manufacturing firms operating in Bangladesh showed that next to infrastructure, corruption was seen
as the next most serious constraint by nearly three o f every five companies. Two other governancerelated issues (tax administration and customs) rankedamong the top s i x constraints.

10.
How has Bangladesh done so well despite such poor governance? Recent analysis
suggests that understanding t h i s conundrum requires unbundling the broad concept o f governance,
recognizing that Bangladesh has had both successes and failure^.^

11.

Bangladesh has seen some impressive successes in governance since the 1980s:
The state has increased its accountability to citizens. The conduct o f three successive, relatively
peaceful elections with high tumouts and with the incumbents losing power twice in succession
i s evidence of the growing maturity o f the electorate. The rapid growth o f civil society and o f an
increasingly mature and critical media has amplified the voices o f the poor and o f citizens more

See W o r l d Bank, “Bangladesh Development Policy Review, Impressive Achievements but Continuing Challenges” (Report 26154-BD,
Washington, D.C., December 14,2003); and BinaM Sen, “Operationalizing Pro-Poor Growth: A Country Case Study o f Bangladesh”

generally. The Supreme Court has asserted i t s independence from the Government and held
successive governments to account through key verdicts in a series o f public interest litigations.
Box 1, A M i x e d Record of Governance

Sovernance in a country refers broadly to the exercise o f power through the country's economic, social, and
)olitical institutions. These include the processes by which governments are selected, held accountable,
nonitored, and replaced; the capacity o f the governments to formulate and implement policies and manage
'esources efficiently; and the respect o f citizens for the institutions that govern social and economic
nteractions among them. Good governance i s underpinned by a system o f checks and balances embedded in an
tccountability framework that i s based in the rule o f law and in transparent transactions and exchanges o f
nfonnation.
b e World Bank Institute has developed a set o f indicators aimed at capturing these broad dimensions o f
;ovemance. These perceptions-based indicators, which cover some 209 countries, have been used since 1998
o measure performance in six main dimensions o f governance: voice and accountability, political stability,
:oveJnment efectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.
3angladesh scored poorly on all s i x indicators for 2004. For control of corruption Bangladesh's percentile
anking was 10.3; forpolitical stability, 11.7; for regulatory quality, 13.3; and for rule of law, 22.2 (see figure).
3angladesh did somewhat better on government effectiveness (26.4) and voice and accountability (28.6).
3angladesh's performance compares poorly with that o f other low-income countries on political stability,
,egulatory quality, and control ofcorruption, whde i t outperforms other low-income countries on voice and
iccountability and rule of law.

comparison o f the point estimates for these indicators over time suggests that Bangladesh's performance
rorsened on all six indcators between 1998 and 2004. But because o f large (though declining) margins o f
mor, there i s not enough evidence to conclude that Bangladesh's governance improved or worsened except in
ie case o f regulatory quality-where it i s possible to say, at a 90 percent confidence interval, that there was a
erceived d e c l i n s a n d control of corruption-where i t i s possible to conclude that there was no improvement
nd probably a deterioration. But i t is also clear that on three o f the six indicators (political stability, regulatory
uality, and control of comption) Bangladesh ranks in the bottom quartile o f all countries, even allowing for
iargins o f error.

The state has increasingly created space for the development of the private sector, through
strong macroeconomic management’ and progress on trade liberalization. Trade in goods nearly
doubled as a share o f GDP between 1990 and 2004, to 30.8 percent, reflecting both a rapid
expansion in garment exports and a significant liberalization o f imports.6 More recently, the
Government has privatized or shut down some 55 state-owned manufacturing enterprises (from a
total o f around 121 in FYO1) and reduced employment levels in these enterprises, visibly
improving their fmances. The Government has also relied on the private sector to deliver
essential public services such as secondary education.
0

Sound macroeconomic policies and greater openness combined with the migration of
Bangladeshi labor abroad have led to a surge in overseas remittances, which reached about 5
percent o f GDP by the end o f the 1990s. Such remittances, together with the earnings from
peacekeeping operations, amount to $5-6 billion a year. These funds directly benefit rural
families, includmg the poor, by helping to finance land purchases, agricultural inputs, and
business start-ups as well as improvements in education and health. Much o f Bangladesh’s

growth has come from a booming private rural economy and private-enterprise-led industrial and
export growth.

Recent eforts to improve governance in the financial sector have had a noticeable impact in
improving the sector’s pefomance. Measures to enhance the capacity o f the Bangladesh Bank
(the central bank), one o f the key institutions o f accountability in the country, and changes in the
regulatory framework have led to improvements in the performance o f private commercial
banks. These banks have met the Basle capital adequacy ratios, seen a sharp decline in
nonperforming loans (from 16 percent in 1998 to 3 percent in 2004 on a net basis), and begunto

strengthen their corporate governance. Although the performance o f nationalized commercial
banks (NCBs) remains problematic, their nonperforming loans have also been reduced, from 27
percent in 1998 to 18 percent in 2004. New lending by NCBs has been capped, a ban on new
loans to defaulters has been strictly enforced, some 100 bank branches have been closed, and the
NCBs’ share o f loans has fallen from 70 percent in 2000 to 40 percent today. One o f the NCBs,
the Rupali Bank, i s being brought to the point o f sale, and management o f the others is being
strengthened prior to their possible sale.
Sustained allocations of public resources .for pro-poor activities have played a crucial role in
ensuring wise allocation of public expenditures and thus in contributing to the strong povertyreducing outcomes, such as by:

o

Containing militav spending at 1.1 percent o f GDP, much less than half the average for
the region, leaving fiscal space for pro-poor spending.

o

Financing rural inj?astructure, particularly roads connecting about 1,400 o f 2,100
growth centers and markets, and thus contributing to the significant increase in nonfarm

activity, employment, and income.

o

Providing a sustained injection of public finds for health and education combined with
progressive policies to ensure participation, inclusion, and empowerment and strong
partnerships with the private sector and NGOs, all o f which have contributed to
Bangladesh’s strong progress in social outcomes.

The state has made space for and forged partnerships with NGOs to deliver public services.
Unlike in many developing countries, where civil society i s either crowded out or co-opted by
the state, in Bangladesh successive governments have recognized the state’s inability to meet the
The fiscal deficit, containedat less than 5 percent o f GDP, was steadily reducedto around 4 percent in FY05 despite large flood-related
expenditures. Inflation averaged around 5 percent in 1990-2003.
The unweighted mean tariff was reduced from 106.5 percent in 1989 to 16.6 percent in2004, and many non-tariff barriers have been
removed.

high public expectations for service delivery and chosen to carve out strategic partnerships with
NGOs to deliver such services as microfinance, health, education, drinking water, and sanitation.
Microfinance reaches around 65 percent o f the coktry’s poor people. And NGOs account for 9
percent o f health care expenditures and 8 percent o f primary enrollment. While the state
continues to play the predominant role in health and education, these figures show that NGOs
provide a growing share. The leading Bangladeshi NGOs have evolved into social enterprises
with considerable capacity for nationwide service delivery, creating a sound foundation for
future social development and poverty reduction.

12.

The state has greatly improved its capacity for managing natural disasters. The macroeconomic
and social impact o f natural disasters has been greatly reduced, and the resilience o f the poor has
increased. The factors contributing to this improvement include greater nonfarm incomes,
policies that have reduced leakages in food distribution and allowed private sector imports, the
highly effective and well-targeted Voluntary Group Feeding system, the construction o f cyclone
shelters, and the establishment o f early waning ~ysterns.~
The response capability o f civil
administrations has markedly improved, and government campaigns to educate households on
food and water safety precautions during floods and cyclones have proved effective. NGOs play
a major role in disaster prevention, recovery, and relief, and vigorous domestic opposition and a
free press have motivated governments to respond promptly to disasters.

These successes are partially offset by some marked failures in governance:
The state of political competition is unhealthy. Political power i s concentrated in two major
parties, led by rival families that have dominated Bangladesh’s politics since i t s independence.
This has discouraged the emergence o f intraparty democracy. A first-past-the-post system o f
elections results in large stable majorities for governments, reducing the effectiveness o f
Parliament by lessening the importance of the opposition. The lack o f competition i s accentuated
by a highly centralized state. In the absence o f elected regional govements that exercise real
political power, a change in power at the center leaves virtually nothing for the losers. The
patron-client nature o f politics feeds the bitter relations and lack o f trust between the two
dominant political parties. Parliament has been ineffective in i t s role as a check on the executive,
and opposition parties o f different hues prefer to mobilize public support for their cause on the
streets and through hartals. The dependence o f political parties on muscle power leads to the
criminalization o f politics and increasing political violence. More recently, extremist religious
movements have taken advantage o f the discord in the secular political leadership through a
series o f violent incidents. Fractious politics are not unique to Bangladesh; there are many
s i m i l a r examples elsewhere in both the developing and the industrial world. But the fractiousness
i s proving costly by contributing to political uncertainty and the poor investment climate.
Theformal legal mechanisms that regulate campaign financing activities are ineffective. As in
many other democracies, developing and industrial alike, elections in Bangladesh cost far more
to contest than candidates are allowed to spend. Each candidate for Parliament i s permitted to
spend up to Tk 500,000 in contesting constituencies that represent around 250,000 voters. While
this amount is not particularly low in relative terms (16 U S cents on a PPP basis per voter)., it i s
only a fraction o f the true cost o f fighting an election. The need to finance campaigns i s
reportedly a major source o f the high levels o f comption in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the
region. Moreover, the illegality o f such funds reduces transparency and blurs the line between a
parliamentarian’s public and private funds. In the absence o f efforts to reduce the cost o f
contesting elections, curb campaign spending, or properly enforce rules relating to the
declaration o f a candidate’s assets and liabilities and make such declarations public, the risks o f
state capture by those who bankroll candidates become significant.

~

points out that although the 1998 flood was far more severe than that o f 1988, GDP p w t h only deceleratedto 3 percent in 1998,’99, while
GDP actually shrank in 1988/89.

6

Revenue mobilization is handicapped by poor governance. Bangladesh’s budgetary revenue
effort has been abysmally low: tax revenue amounts to less than 10 percent o f GDP and comes
from a very small share o f the population. T h i s situation reflects the serious governance
challenges facing the National Board o f Revenue (see paras. 103-05). The small tax base in turn
creates huge incentives for corruption as well as opportunities for rent seeking by forcing the
Government to pay abysmally low salaries to civil servants, reduce operations and maintenance
expenditures, and force a rationing o f essential public services.
Despite recent progress, public financial management needs further strengthening to become an
effective policymaking and accountability instrument for the Government. While public
expenditure policy has many positive aspects (see para. ll),
financial management systems
remain weak, underminingthe effectiveness o f the policy. The budget planning process lacks a
medium-term strategic orientation, allowing discretionary behavior in budget planning and
implementation. While efforts to introduce information technology in budget accounting and
reporting are under way, manual systems are s t i l l used for a11 budgetary transactions, reducing
the effectiveness and transparency o f expenditure management. Public financial accountability
systems inside and outside the executive are at a nascent stage, and consolidating these systems
w i l l require long, sustained efforts. Until recently procurement has been a major source o f
corruption. A modern and effective legal framework for procurement has been developed and
now needs to be implemented and i t s outcomes monitored.
Budgetary constraints and failure to create transparent and accountable processes for private
sector participation in infrastructure have contributed to the sector’s low levels of investment.
Inadequate revenues and weak financial management contribute to the Government’s inability to
fund infrastructure from the budget, while private provision has lacked transparency. There has
been progress in some areas, such as telecommunications, where cellular operators have quickly
overtaken landlines. But power shortages are cited by business enterprises as their most
important constraint, and port facilities are inefficient, corrupt, and failing to keep up with
demand, raising shipping costs and reducing competitiveness. Failure to create transparent and
accountable processes for private participation in infrastructure and to address pricing issues has
been a major constraint on investment in electricity, and powerful interests tend to resist reforms
in Chittagong port, the country’s largest.

As in many developing countries, politicization, low salaries, and poor human resource

management have contributed to a steady deterioration in the quality of the civil sewice as well
as other government services, such as the police and the judiciary. The civil service today, with
some important exceptions, i s increasingly poorly trained, highly hierarchical and secretive, and
open to political pressures. Moreover, the civil service sees itself as accountable to i t s higherleveI masters rather than to Bangladeshi citizens, whom it i s supposed to serve. T h i s situation
has eroded the quality o f public service delivery and regulation while undermining
accountability and increasing the fiduciary risks to public funds. While the wise decision to
develop strategic partnerships with the private sector and NGOs has mitigated the costs to the
country, civil service management and performance issues cloud prospects for the country’s

future.

The justice sector is dys@nctional. Despite an activist and vigilant Supreme Court, the justice
sector faces serious challenges o f inefficiency and corruption. Law and order i s weak, and crime
i s underreported and poorly investigated. The police, the citizens’ first point of contact with the
formal justice system, are held in little confidence. Bangladesh has the lowest ratio o f police to
citizens on the subcontinent. About 70 percent o f i t s police officers (around 80,000) are
constables, poorly trained and equipped and with limited authority, education, and skills. And
only 1.2 percent o f the police force i s female. The focus o f the criminal justice system appears to
be on maintaining public order and protecting the wealthy and powerful rather than preventing,
detecting, and investigating crime. The lower courts are particularly inefficient and corrupt. As

7

the PRSP notes, “an inherited colonial system of criminal and civil justice which ensures
‘certainty of expense but zmceytainty of results’ poses major barriers to the poor in terms o f
accessibility and affordability.”’ Moreover, enforcing a contract through a court costs three times
as much in Bangladesh as it does in China and requires half as many days on average. Similarly,
banks find it nearly impossible to collect collateral on defaulting loans. T h i s situation i s a major
impediment to attracting foreign direct investment. A credible justice system that enforces clear
laws in a just, transparent, and efficient manner i s essential to create the stable, predictable, and
secure environment necessary for investment and to ensure the human security that i s integral to
sustainable development and poverty reduction.

13.
How has Bangladesh’s relatively strong economic and social performance coexisted
with poor governance? Two factors need to be recognized. First, judgments about the quality o f
governance in Bangladesh need to take a sufficiently nuanced view. The analysis above shows that
governments o f differing political persuasions have pursued fairly sound economic policy stances
with respect to a commitment to nlacroeconomic stability and economic openness, adopted a privatesector-led development strategy, created space for NGOs to operate and complement government
efforts, and allocated public resources sensibly, particularly in terms o f pro-poor spending.
14.
Second, policymakers creating space for the private sector and NGOs would not be
remarkable in itself but for the fact that the private sector and NGOs have taken advantage o f this
space to deliver growth and services. By creating a duty-free environment through bonded
warehouses, for example, the Government enabled the ready-made garment sector to get around the
constraints o f a corrupt tax administration. Similarly, by encouraging provision o f social services by
the private sector and NGOs, the Government compensated for weak governance and poor public
service delivery and allowed itself to concentrate on i t s proper role as a regulator and provider o f
public health services.
15.
These steady but largely untnunpeted and insufficiently recognized gains are often
overshadowed by the much noisier failures o f the country’s political governance and the corrupt
elements in its elite. I t i s these failures that tend to be captured in the perceptions-based data on
governance, which have not yet been extended to broader dimensions o f govemance. Analysts
outside the country therefore seem to often overlook i t s strong economic and social outcomes and the
good policy governance that underpins these outcomes. The above and other reforms (attachment
10) taken by various governments have been instrumental in delivering the good social and
economic outcomes Bangladesh registers at present.
16.
But the price that Bangladesh pays for poor governance may be rising to the point where it
begins to seriously undermine the effectiveness o f the country’s development efforts. The
increasingly fractious politics and the political uncertainty they breed are a major factor in the poor
investment climate, particularly for foreign direct investment, offsetting the Government’s proprivate-sector stance. Foreign investors that might have been attracted by the Government’s ‘open
economy’ policies are put o f f by poor infrastructure, the inability o f the justice sector to enforce
contracts, the deteriorating law and order, and the high level o f corruption in regulatory agencies.
Moreover, while govemment policies have been sound, implementation has always been weak and i s
steadily deteriorating, reflecting the failure to address institutioiial weaknesses and reform the civil
service. The failure to control corruption and the deteriorating law and order are symptoms of a
larger failuse o f governance, reflecting the perverse incentives arising fi-om the high cost o f
contesting elections, the politicization o f the civil service, and the steady, long-term erosion in i t s
quality and in the quality o f law enforcement. In addition, govemment responses to weaknesses in
implementation, often compelled by pressure from the public due to the relatively free media a d
active civil society, have tended to be ad hoc. Experience in other countries shows that such
responses typically fail to systematically address institutional weaknesses. Innovations and

improvements often have proved unsustainable and rarely survive the departure o f inspired leadersand may even become problems themselves, as with the excesses committed by the Rapid Action
Battalion.

17.
Nor can the sustainability o f past social achievements be taken for granted. The early gains
took up the slack in the system. Further progress toward the ambitious MDGs w i l l prove difficult if
the Government fails to address underlying institutional weaknesses. Giving priority to pro-poor
resource allocations w i l l not be enough. Doctors and other health care providers must reach mothers
needing pre- and postnatal care. And teachers need to attend schools. Similarly, a pro-private-sector
stance w i l l not be enough to address the massive underinvestment in infrastructure-particularly the
underinvestment in energy, which accounts for the current energy crisis in Bangladesh. The solution
also requires tackling the growing lack o f transparency in deals reIating to private provision o f
infrastructure .

UNLOCKINGBANGLADESH'S P O T E N T L A STRATEGY FOR
ACCELERATED POVERTY REDUCTION

BANGLADESH'S
DEVELOPMENT
VISION AND THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

18.
Recognizing these challenges, the Government has outlined its vision in the 111 PRSP,
"Unlocking the Potential," released in October 2005. The PRSP appropriately stresses the l i n k s
between investment, growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. It identifies key areas where
reforms are needed, public investments are required, and public policies merit improvement. It does
not shy away from tackling difficult issues, according a prominent place to combating corruption,
restoring rule o f law, and making governance work for the poor. I t builds on past achievements, aims
to prevent slippages in areas where progress has been made, and addresses weaknesses in
implementation, emphasizes the centrality o f employment creation, and strengthens the focus on
women's empowerment.
19.
As the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN)" observes the PRSP vision appropriately builds on
the policy triangle o f growth, human development, and governance and argues for special attention
to goals and outcomes in the following areas:
0
0
0
0

0

Employment generation.
Nutrition.
Maternal health.
Quality o f education.
Sanitation and safe water.
Criminal justice system.
Local governance.

The PRSP emphasizes that progress toward these goals requires creating an open,
competitive environment conducive to private investment, with particular importance given to
exports and the rural sector, where 85 percent o f Bangladesh's poor people live." improving the
ability o f poor people to participate more fully in the growth process, through access to better-quality
education, health, water, and nutrition; and, most important, ensuring that the Government addresses
both sector governance concerns and core governance issues, such as by improving government
capacity, promoting local governance, tackling corruption, enhancing access to justice for the poor,

20.

This would be the case, for example, in the appointment of unusually effective individualsto headkey institutions, such as the
Bangladesh Bank, or the creation o f the Rapid Action Battalion to bolster a weak police force.

and improving security and public order. As the PRSP puts it, “a major thrust of the PRS has to be
on ensuring good governance ”. l2

21.
The JSAN, however, notes that the PRSP lacks a well-thought-out process o f growth
acceleration to justify the high growth projections, and that despite the focus on a private-sectordriven growth agenda, there i s too much reliance on public rather than private investments.
Moreover, a more comprehensive review should have been done o f the trade policy regime, which
impinges on growth. The omission o f a strategic vision for the development o f the fmancial sector
also weakens the pro-poor growth agenda presented in the PRSP. While the PRSP recognizes
infrastructure as an important impediment to growth and poverty reduction, it needs a greater focus
on improving governance in these sectors, especially power. The lack o f specificity on sectoral
governance reforms, despite the very welcome strong focus on overall governance, suggests a need
to broaden the ownership o f governance reforms within the Government. Finally, to be a credible
instrument, the PRSP requires a clear plan for implementation and monitoring--mainstreamed in the
Government’s processes for policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring-that
would
facilitate prioritization and achievement o f i t s goals.
B.

DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES

1. The Poverty Challenge
22.
The PRSP recognizes that Bangladesh’s progress in social and economic development
and the way forward should be seen in relation to the magnitude of the poverty ~ha1lenge.l~
While income poverty in both urban and rural areas declined by one percentage point a year in the
1990s-an impressive 9 percentage points over the decade-the absolute number o f people below
the poverty line has not changed. Some 63 million people live in deprivation, two-thirds o f them
caught in extreme poverty. Poverty has fallen unevenly across regions, with most o f the gains in the
Dhaka division and large pockets o f poverty remaining in Rajshahi, Chittagong, and Khulna.
Moreover, inequality i s rising, making the task o f reducing poverty even more difficult. Attaining the
key income poverty goals will require accelerating the rate o f income poverty reduction substantially
beyond the 1.5 percent a year achieved in 1990-2002. Adult illiteracy i s persistent and falling only
slowly, particularly among women. With malnutrition levels in South Asia s t i l l among the highest in
the world, Bangladesh’s relatively good perfonnance compared with India’s and Pakistan’s i s little
solace. More than half the children ages one to three are underweight, and more than 40 percent o f
women are severely malnourished. Maternal mortality i s high as a result o f inadequate access to
health services during pregnancy and childbirth and the poor nutritional status o f pregnant women.
2. Progress and Prospects on the Millennium Development Goals
23.
These challenges are reflected in Bangladesh’s progress and prospects on attaining
MDGs, where the picture i s mixed. As noted, the country has made remarkable progress toward
several MDGs. Several others are within reach, though attaining them w i l l require special attention
and concerted effort. And some w i l l challenge the country for some time (see attachment 2). A
mixed picture i s thus emerging, as two recent MDG assessments ~uggest:’~

Bangladesh has already attained the MDGs relating to gender parity in schooling opportunities
and universal primary education. I t is the only country in South Asia other than Sri Lanka to
have achieved parity in male and female enrollment at not just the primary but also the

secondary level. Attaining two other MDGs-reduction o f consumption poverty and under-five
mortality--is also feasible, through a mix o f sector-specific interventions (such as expanding
immunization coverage and reducing pupil-teacher ratios), economic growth, improved coverage
o f infrastnicture, and social safety net programs. Attaining the MDG relating to child
malnutrition and those in education relating to universal net primary enrollment and primary
completion remains challenging but within reach. For child malnutrition, the projections suggest
that Bangladesh could come very close-within 5 percentage points-to the MDG o f having no
more than 34 percent o f i t s children underweight by 2015. Whether Bangladesh i s likely to
achieve net primary enrollment and primary completion rates exceeding 83-86 percent by 2015
remains unclear.
Attaining the maternal mortality goal w i l l be challenging for Bangladesh. The country has the
lowest maternal mortality ratio in South Asia, but the region’s indicators are among the worst in
the world. In 2001 Bangladesh’s ratio was in the range o f 320-400 maternal deaths per 100,000
live births. To meet the target Bangladesh must reduce this figure to 143 per 100,000 live births,
which will require inducing m j o r behavioral changes in mothers, vastly expanding access to
quality reproductive health services, and broadly improving the socioeconomic situation.

Bangladesh had nearly achieved the safe water goal, with 97 percent o f i t s population having
access to pathogen-free water. But arsenic contamination posed a new round o f challenges, and
the population share with access to pathogen- and arsenic-free water i s now roughly 80 percent
in urban areas and 70 percent in rural areas. The Government’s “total sanitation” program has
been a real success in rural areas, achieving broad coverage. But new challenges to attaining the
MDG for sanitation are emerging, driven in part by urbanization: only 14 percent o f s l u m
dwellers in urban areas have access to sealed latrines, and the urban population i s projected to
nearly double-to 50 million people-by 20 15.
Reversing the trend o f deforestation and increasing energy efficiency weigh heavily on the MDG
agenda o f ensuring environmental sustainability. The financial and institutional resources needed
to accomplish these objectives pose significant challenges to attainment o f this MDG.
3. Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects
24.
In the face of these challenges, achieving the PRSP’s poverty reduction objectives and
related MDGs will require that Bangladesh not only maintain i t s current achievements in
good, stable growth-but, more important, move to a higher and more equitable growth path
of 6-7 percent a year (see attachment ). The country’s GDP growth performance has been good for
almost two decades, averaging 5.4 percent a year in FYO1-05, the highest five-year average since
independence. This growth was underpinned by a resurgence o f domestic private investment, which
grew at an average annual rate o f 10 percent, increasing i t s share in GDP from 16 percent in FYOl to
18.5 percent in FY05.15 While benefiting from continued strong export growth (about 8 percent a
year), with garment exports the mainstay, growth has also been relatively broad based. Construction
and services sectors have seen particularly strong growth, fueled by large inflows o f remittances.
25.
Strong growth in exports and remittances has also benefited the external sector. Exports
increased by 40 percent and remittances doubled in FY00-05, while imports rose by 50 percent. The
current account recorded small surpluses in FYO2-04 before slipping into a deficit equaling 0.9
percent o f GDP in FY05. The sharply rising cost o f o i l and other commodity imports added to the
current account deficit in the latest year. Benefiting from a pick-up in concessional and other longterm capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves increased from their precarious level o f $1 billion
(one month o f import cover) at the end o f 2001 to a more comfortable $3 billion by the end o f FY05.

l5Meanwhile, the share of public investment fell fmm 7 percent o f GDP to

11

6 percent

26.
The Government's medium-term macroeconomic framework in the PRSP commits to
accelerating GDP growth from 5.4 percent in FY05 to 6.0 percent in FY06 and 6.5 percent in
FYOS. Such an acceleration o f growth would require a substantial increase in investment and
productivity levels. Productivity growth in turn w i l l depend on improvements in infrastructure
provision and labor quality, which as the JSAN notes w i l l take time to bring about. Two major
sources o f growth are highly vulnerable, however, pointing to the need for diversification of the
economy. Garment exports, three-quarters o f the country's total exports o f goods, face greater
competition from low-cost producers such as China with the dismantling o f the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing since January 2005. The availability o f cultivable land, an important source o f
past agricultural growth, has been declining, in part because o f urbanization and iilfrastructure
development. While these potential threats call for efforts to enhance the competitiveness o f exports
and productivity o f agriculture, there i s also little alternative to policies encouraging the
diversification o f the economy beyond these sectors. Key to meeting the higher growth target w i l l be
attracting foreign investment - a priority whose urgency, the JSAN argues, i s not sufficiently
reflected in the PRSP. Attracting such investments w i l l require substantially improving the
investment climate. This in turn w i l l require addressing the main constraints confronting private
investors, such as infrastructure shortages (particularly power and ports), poor law and order, high
levels o f corruption, and the weak regulatory environment. And removing the infrastructure
constraints w i l l require better governance and more transparent private provision o f infrastructure.

27.
Accelerated growth and continued fiscal prudence are expected to improve prospects
for fiscal and debt sustainability, although, as the JSAN emphasizes, poor revenue efforts and
growing liabilities of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) remain a concern. The Government
lowered the fiscal deficit from around 5 percent o f GDP in FYOl to 3.5 percent in FYOS and
adopted more prudent financing patterns, with greater emphasis on concessional external financing.
As a result, public sector debt has been contained at less than 50 percent o f GDP and appears to be
on a sustainable path. Over the medium term the Government's program in the PRSP commits to
maintainingJiscaZ de$cits at or below 4 percent o f GDP and limiting domestic financing to about 2
percent o f GDP. This reflects an expected improvement in total revenue collection, projected to
reach 12 percent o f GDP by FY09 as a result o f modernizing the National Board o f Revenue and
containing expenditures at 15.5 percent o f GDP. Fiscal sustainability w i l l also depend, however, on
the Government's ability to contain the growing liabilities o f the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation
stemming from the recent increases in global oil prices, which have not yet been fully passed through
to consuniers-leading to losses equal to 0.7 percent o f GDP in FYO5." Continued monetary
prudence w i l l be necessary to contain inflation at the targeted rates o f 7 percent in FY06 and less
than 5 percent by FY08. Although external debt is relatively low, at about 33 percent o f GDP and
mostly on concessional tans, the country faces some medium-term liquidity risks because o f
modest export levels (14 percent o f GDP in FY05).17 The JSAN, therefore, encourages the
authorities to further improve the working o f the foreign exchange market and to allow the exchange
rate to operate flexibly in response to changes in economic fundamentals.
4. Service Delivery
28.
Further gains in human development will be difficult to achieve and sustain without
service delivery systems that are more accountable, more responsive, and able to reach the
very poor. Improvements are needed in the quality o f education, including higher education, to
provide skilled labor-and in health services, including maternal health and nutrition. With
l6Sensitivity anaIysis by Bank and IMF staff suggest that I3angladesh's debt-to-GDP ratio is more vulnerable to a shock to reformcontingent liabilities of stateowned enterprises and a potential large real depreciation of the exchange rate as compared to other factors,
including lower long-runGDP growth, would have an impact of up to 2 percentage points on the debt dynamics.
The ratio o f the net present value of fiiture debt service obligations to goods and nonfactor services exports stands at about 150 percent.

12

government highly centralized, the poor find it difficult to hold public service providers accountable
for delivering services and responding to their needs. Recent efforts to enhance local democracy and
make more resources available to local governments provide an opportunity to strengthen local
governance and increase the voice o f the poor in identifymg, designing, and implementing programs
for rural infrastructure and social services.

5. Core Governance Institutions
29.
Improvements in service delivery will also require improvements in core governance
institutions. The JSAN welcomes the strong focus on governance in the PRSP but also commends
the emphasis on a prioritized, selective approach. A key priority w i l l be public financial
management. The rather modest revenue effort will need to be eihanced, and public financial
management, including public procurement, w i l l need to be strengthened to ensure that scarce public
funds reach their intended beneficiaries. This in turn calls for improvements in civil service
management. Access o f the poor to justice w i l l be a high priority, as w i l l broader improvements in
the justice sector to ensure the rule o f law and reduce investor uncertainty about enforcement o f
contracts. Public access to information w i l l be key to such improvements in governance and to the
ability o f civil society to intermediate public oversight o f the Government’s budget and development
programs.

. THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S ASSISTANCE S T R A T E G Y
A. THESTRATEGIC FOCUS-GOVERNANCE
AT CENTER STAGE
30.
The World Bank Group will align i t s Country Assistance Strategy with the
Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. It w i l l make governance the core focus, cutting across
the two pillars o f the Government’s strategy-improving the investment climate and empowering the
poor-while also addressing the core governance issues common to these two pillars (figure 1).
Under pillar 1, improving the investment climate, the Bank Group w i l l build on Bangladesh’s
strengths by continuing to help maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate i t s progress toward
an open, market-based economy. At the same time it w i l l help the Government address weaknesses
in the investment climate by removing policy and institutional constraints to infiastructure provision
and improving i t s weak regulatory quality. Under pillar 2, empowering the poor, the Bank Group
will attempt to build on Bangladesh’s impressive social gains by helping the Government meet the
MDGs relating to human development while also enhancing the quality and efficiency o f service
provision to the poor by strengthening sector governance and accountability and enhancing voice and
participation. The Bank Group w i l l also respond to the policy opening in local governance by
launching i t s first direct efforts to strengthen service delivery by local governments and enhance
their accountability to local communities.
31.
Progress under both pillars w i l l depend on successful reforms in Bangladesh’s core
governance. The Bank Group w i l l therefore assist in strengthening public financial management to
help increase budgetary revenues and ensure better use o f public funds, and in revitalizing
institutions that enhance public accountability. The Bank Group w i l l also j o i n i t s partners in helping
to strengthen civil society and provide access to information, both critical if citizens are to hold their
government to account.
32.
This approach o f mainstreaming governance in the Bank Group’s program w i l l mean that i t s
operations, whether in infrastructure, health, education, financial services, or any other sector, w i l l be
as much about improving governance as they are about improving sector performance and service
delivery. A special focus on involving communities in program delivery and monitoring, through
support for local governance and community-driven development (CDD) approaches, aims to ensure
that the onus o f enforcing accountability for results and management o f resources increasingly shifts
fiom the Bank Group and i t s development partners to beneficiaries, improving chances for success
and sustainability.

13

33.
Recognizing the interdependence o f the governance challenges facing Bangladesh, the Bank
Group strategy covers a broad spectrum o f issues. However, heeding the sensible advice in the
Government’s PRSP to avoid dissipating donor resources for governance across too wide a front, the
Bank Group w i l l pragmatically focus i t s energies and resources on four key areas that are sufficiently
important to use i t s political capital with the Government to pursue results and where it i s believed
that results can be achieved: improving governance and efficiency in infrastructure, especially
power; supporting local governance and community-driven development initiatives that empower the
poor by bringing governments closer to the people or involve beneficiaries in the design and
implementation o f programs; improving the Government’s public financial management, including
making procurement more competitive and transparent; and strengthening the Government’s tax and
revenue effort. These areas w i l l be important avenues for delivering results in the Bank Group’s
program (see attachment 1). At the same time the Bank Group w i l l maintain a modest level o f policy
dialogue and lending engagement across a broader front, enabling it to respond quickly to
opportunities for reform that may arise in other areas and to support the work o f i t s development
partners. The following sections outline the proposed program in more detail.
Figure 1. The CAS Framework

B. PILLAR 1: IMPROVING THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE
34.
A healthy investment climate i s essential to generate the higher levels o f investment and
productivity needed to sustain higher growth and absorb the new entrants to Bangladesh’s growing
labor force. It i s especidly needed to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), with i t s technology
transfer and other productivity-enhancing spillover effects. Although Bangladesh has, on paper, the
most liberal FDI regime in South Asia, FDI remains low (estinmted at 1 percent o f GDP in FY05).
Investors clearly are deterred by perceptions o f high.political risk and by weaknesses in the
implementation o f the liberal FDI regime, including nontransparent tendering and contracting
processes for private infrastructure investors, severe infrastructure shortages, high levels o f
corruption that raise the cost o f doing business, and other investment climate problems identified in
the 2003 Investment Climate Assessment. While the recent investor interest in natural-resourcebased projects i s promising, these projects have not yet materialized, and the investment climate

14

remains problematic for large and small investors alike. Moreover, the investment climate in rural
the development o f agribusiness
areas-where
most o f Bangladesh’s poor live-undermines
activities that could be the main driver o f broad-based employment.

35.
The Government’s strategy as laid out in the PRSP has two primary aims: First, to ensure a
stable macroeconomy and enabling business environment by improving trade policies, improving the
legal and regulatory environment for the private sector, developing a n effective competition policy,
establishing FDI-friendly policies, and deepening financial sector reforms. Second, to strengthen
sectors critical to pro-poor growth, including agriculture, infrastructure, water resource management,
and information and communication technology (ICT).
The Bank Group together with several development partners w i l l focus onfour investment
climate priorities: maintaining macroeconomic stability; improving governance and efficiency in
infi-astructure, especially power and ports; reducing trade restrictions and administrative barriers; and
providing private-sector-friendly finance, land, and labor markets (table 3). Weak governance
remains the main challenge in each o f these areas. As a n integral part o f i t s strategy the Bank Group
w i l l therefore seek to address the underlying institutional incentives that create opportunities for poor
governance and corrupt behavior, undermining sector performance and better development
outcomes. To support private sector growth and boost the competitiveness o f industry, the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) w i l l focus on technical assistance and investments in
financial institutions to support the development o f small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs);
investments to support financial market development and growth o f the telecommunications and
manufacturing sectors; and energy sector and infrastructure investments, subject to progress on
governance and sector reforms and appropriate environmental and social safeguards. IFC w i l l focus
in particular on supporting competitive manufacturing and services. Special emphasis w i l l be given
to encouraging FDI and regional integration through IFC investments and technical assistance from
the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) and Foreign Investment Advisory Service
(FIAS). The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) w i l l provide support to foreign
investors through political risk insurance, and support to the wider efforts to improve the investment
climate through technical assistance to build the capacity o f key government agencies focusing on
private sector development. In addition, IFC’s SEDF w i l l continue to partner with FIAS on a
program to reduce administrative barriers, promote special economic zones, and build government
capacity to promote private investment.

1. Maintain Macroeconomic Stability
37.
Bangladesh has a good record o f maintaining macroeconomic stability. But recent changes
in the external environment have revealed possible fiscal and balance o f payment vulnerabilities (see
attachment 3). The budget has recently come under pressure because o f stagnating revenues, growing
losses o f the state-owned energy enterprises (totaling about 0.8 percent of GDP in FY05), public
sector wage increases, and higher explicit and implicit budgetary subsidies. Meanwhile, the capacity
to absorb concessional external financing remains weak as a result of weak implementation capacity.
Improving Jiscal sustainability is therefore essential, with the priority being to reduce the losses of
state-owned energy entelyrises and strengthen revenue administration (see paras. 103-05).
38.
The Bank w i l l continue to support fiscal adjustment through i t s policy dialogue and
development policy lending, including progressive alignment o f energy prices to international levels
to lower the losses o f the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, loss reduction programs and rollback
o f state ownership in remaining state-owned enterprises (where the Bank i s supporting voluntary
retirement schemes and retrenchment costs for closed or privatized enterprises), and modernization
and strengthening o f tax administration to improve revenue performance (see paras. 103-05). To help
address quasi-fiscal deficits and contingent liabilities, the Bank w i l l support lending caps on the
nationalized commercial banks to contain their losses and improve their performance and assist the
Government with their restructuring and privatization.

2. Improve Governance and Efficiency in Infrastructure
39.
In the infrastructure sector the World Bank Group w i l l focus on improving governance and
transparency in large-scale investments and infrastructure asset management; and supporting
investments in small-scale, decentralized infrastructure services. It will also try to support the
leveraging o f information and communication technology for growth and good governance.
Improving governance in infrastructure sectors and expanding infiastructurefor growth

40.
Ineffective and poorly managed infrastructure, particularly power and ports, has been
reported as the main constraint to businesses and households in Bangladesh. The main causes o f
the poor performance are the institutional and governance structures for organizing, managing, and
financing infrastructure sectors; a distorted pricing framework; and the excessive political
interference in investment decisions. All these limit the much-needed private sector participation in
these crucial sectors and consequently the resources available to upgrade them. The World Bank
Group and i t s development partners w i l l focus on improving sector governance and supporting
reforms for the efficient provision o f infrastructure services in the public axid private sectors. Priority
w i l l be given to appropriate and transparent processes for identifying, procuring, and managing
infrastructure projects, essential to attract private sector participation. Specific areas for World Bank
Group support, conditioned on monitorable progress on governance, include providing energy for
growth and empowerment and improving national transport and communication systems.
41.
Providing energyfor growth and empowerment. Only a third o f households in Bangladesh
have access to electricity. In rural areas, where grid-supplied power i s largely absent, access i s
limited to a few households and enterprises. The lack o f reliable power supply imposes big costs on
businesses+aptive
power generation, widely used, increases electricity costs by 50 percent
compared with grid-supplied power-and load-shedding has major adverse effects on industry and
daily life. Power shortages are likely to become an important constraint on growth if not addressed in
the near term.

42.
In addition, the sector suffers from major inefficiencies, and the losses accumulated by stateowned energy enterprises are a big drain on the budget. Sector performance i s characterized by
growing load-shedding (up to 800 megawatts a day in 2005), large financial and technical losses,

16

uncertainties surrounding future natural gas supplies for the sector and development o f new
generation capacity, and a new and still-weak regulatory agency.
43.
Governance issues affecting the development o f Bangladesh’s power sector demand
coordinated action by key donors. The World Bank Group, in collaboration with the ADB,18 w i l l
focus first on expanding power generation capacity in the short run, to address the load-shedding and
supply constraints that have become acute as a result o f political interference in the procurement o f
new generation capacity (box 2). Helping the Government address these procurement constraints i s a
Bank Group priority; the Bank Group w i l l also support rehabilitation o f existing generation plants as
the most cost-effective means o f bringing additional power on line in the short run.
44.
The World B a n k Group will focus on improving the policy environment for power
development through technical assistance and policy-based lending @SCs). It will assist the
Government with the development o f a least-cost generation plan and a generation fmancing strategy
that would enable mobilization o f private sector funds, with the support o f IFC, MIGA, the ADB,
and others. Investments in peak power capacity expansion and complementary transmission facilities
are planned, jointly with the ADB, subject to the Government’s committing to a fully open and
competitive procurement process. Support for the Government’s “small-scale power program” i s
also envisaged, subject to the same condition. Also planned are investments in urban power
distribution systems to strengthen their performance through corporatization, and in rural
transmission, distribution, and electrification, following on from the current rural electricity project.
Cross-border infrastructure i s not yet firmly planned, but the Bank expects to support this as and
when it emerges. On the policy side the Bank’s main objective in the sector i s to improve i t s
governance and commercial viability; satisfactory implementation o f an appropriate energy pricing
formula, the strengthening o f the Energy Regulatory Commission, and completion and
implementation o f a financial restructuring plan for the power sector w i l l be pursued in parallel.
45.
In the gas sector further policy and regulatory reform i s required for private investment to
materialize and meet rapidly growing domestic gas demand from industry and the power sector over
the coming years. Petrobangla coordinates oil, gas, and mineral exploration, production, and
marketing, and also controls the activities o f gas sector entities, although they are nominally
independent corporate bodies under the Companies Act. The largest o f these, Titas Gas Transmission
and Distribution Company, which controls more than 60 percent o f the gas market, suffers from very
high system losses and poor bill collection. The Bank w i l l support the development o f an enabling
environment for the domestic gas sector through policy dialogue and policy-based lending. The Bank
w i l l consider key gas transport investments (pipelines) for financing, in coordination with the ADB,
while IFC w i l l consider direct investments, should suitable opportunities arise. Similarly, the World
Bank Group w i l l work toward supporting government and private sector efforts aimed at
environmentally and socially sustainable exploration o f the large coal deposits identified in the
country.

l8
The U.S.Agency for International Development i s focusing on rural electrificationwithin the common framework above. Until recently
the ADB had been the lead donor in the sector.

17

Box 2. Issues in the Power Sector
In 2005 Bangladesh’s power sector generated 160 lulowatt-hours o f electricity per capita, among the lowest
levels in the world. W h i l e installed generating capacity i s 5,025 megawatts (MW), secure capacity i s only
about 3,950 MW. In 2005 load-shedding o f up to 800 M W was necessary on 287 days, for a total o f 1,433
hours (equivalent to 60 full days). Major industries have responded by sharply expanding captive power
generation. But the load-shedding badly affects growth, especially for small and medium-scale industries
and others that cannot afford captive generation. With electricity consumption growing an average 8.2
percent a year in 1994-2005, Bangladesh faces an expected shortfall o f about 2,500 M W o f generating
capacity over the next five years. The reasons behind the shortfall are complex, but one i s apparent
government interference in procuring power generation plants. Contracts are subject to frequent
retenderings without bids being awarded, substantially delaying project implementation.

Besides the limits in physical infrastructure, the power sector faces critical financial challenges. Major
power sector entities are financially insolvent. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) owes
the Government Tk 56 billion in debt service liabilities. The power sector has poor accounting practices,
resulting in delays in finalizing accounts and completing audits, overvaluation o f assets, underestimation o f
expenses, and inadequate provision for bad debts. Poor governance, reflected in l o w bill collection rates and
high system losses (technical and nontechnical), continue to hamper the sector’s development and financial
sustainability .
In addition to support for capacity expansion, development partners have been providing support to BPDB
and the Dhaka Electsic Supply Authority (DESA) to improve their financial management capacity and
upgrade their financial management systems. The Asian Development Bank has provided support for
corporatizing Ashuganj Power Station, several distribution companies, and ultimately BPDB itself.

46.
Improving national transport and communication systems. The private sector has taken on a
growing role in transport, bringing improvements in sector performance. Today state-owned
transport companies carry less than 5 percent o f passenger traffic and about 1 percent o f fkeight. The
private sector i s also engaged in road construction and maintenance. Competition i s similarly strong
in inland water transport, where services are provided mainly by small private operators. But
Bangladesh Railways faces strong competition only from the road sector, not from private rail
operators. And in the port sector private participation i s limited to cargo services.

47.
Despite progress in the sector, several issues remain. There are critical physical and policy
barriers to passenger and freight flows, and the continuing low productivity o f the remaining statemn activities strains the national budget. The Chittagong port, which handles 85 percent o f the
country’s trade, suffers from labor problems, poor management, and lack o f equipment, all o f which
create opportunities for corr~ption.’~
Domestic financing o f road maintenance i s inadequate, and
regulatory procedures remain complex. All t h i s l i m i t s the ability o f the nation’s transport system to
respond to user needs.
48.
The World Bank Group will support the Government’s transport sector strategy, aimed at
gradually establishing an integrated multimodal transport system and promoting subregional
cooperation by developing transit links and cross-border facilities. This strategy requires
strengthening policies and institutions that govern road, rail, inland water, and port services to
improve efficiency and quality. The ultimate objective i s to facilitate private sector participation in
financing large infrastructure projects and particularly in securing appropriate financing for
maintenance, which has emerged as a serious problem for the & m e viability of the transport sector.
Through policy dialogue and investment projects, the World Bank Group, in cooperation with
several development partners, including ADB and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC),
w i l l focus on removing bottlenecks in the prinlary road network and establishing a sustainable road

maintenance funding mechanism; supporting improvements in the main transport corridors,
including the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor as a major export corridor and the Padma Bridge; providing
support to the rail sector, contingent upon reforms o f Bangladesh Railways to increase i t s financial
sustainability and commercial orientation; and supporting regional cooperation in railways and
harmonization o f policies, technical standards, and operating procedures to encourage international
freight and passenger rail traffic.
Supporting investments in community and small-scale infrastructure

49.
The Bank, together with Japan and other development partners, w i l l support small-scale
infrastructure projects that give the poor in rural areas access to such services as piped water, farmto-market roads, rural transport, and power. In addition, the Bank w i l l continue to support rural grid
electrification through the Rural Electrification Board, focusing also on transforming the rural
electrification cooperative sector, with corporatization or consolidation as possibilities. Such projects
w i l l provide power for m a l development until the national grid reaches these areas. Special attention
w i l l be given to improving rural livelihoods through small-scale investments supported by a followon project, the second Social Investment Program Project with the Social Development Fund. Smallscale infrastructure projects also w i l l be supported through the program to strengthen local
governance (see paras. 85-92).
Leveraging information and communication technologyfor growth and governance

50.

Although Bangladesh has not yet seized the opportunity to use information and
communication technology for development and governance, the Government’s PRSP recognizes i t s
role in socioeconomic development. With around four phones for every hundred people in
Bangladesh, reliable access to telecommunications and the Internet remains limited. Growth in the
sector has been driven mainly by private investments in the mobile market. Delays in restructuring
the govexmnent-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) have continued to
hamper sector growth. Attracting further investments in the sector w i l l require a stronger regulator
and a predictable and transparent regulatory framework.

51.
The World Bank i s using technical assistance and policy dialogue to support the
Government’s reform agenda. Policy-based lending (DSCs) will play a role in the future, most
immediately to support the corporatization o f the BTTB. A key objective i s to improve I C T sector
performance by fully separating the policy and operational functions in telecommunications,
improving the regulatory environment for telecommunications, and encouraging development o f
nationwide broadband infrastructure through public-private partnerships.A second aim i s to use I C T
in government to improve service delivery and governance, including through e-procurement and
through e-government initiatives for providing citizen services. IFC has supported the rapid growth
o f mobile capacity in Bangladesh and w i l l continue to look for opportunities to invest in private
telecommunications and other ICT service providers. MIGA w i l l support foreign investors interested
inthe ICT sector through the provision o f political risk insurance.

3. Reduce Trade Restrictions and Administrative Barriers
Removing trade restrictions to enhance competitiveness

52.
Trade regulations, a proliferation of paratariffs, and arbitrary and cumbersome
customs procedures create opportunities for corruption, reduce competitiveness, and raise the
cost of doing business. Bangladesh remains the most highly protected economy on the subcontinent,
with tariff rates well above the regional average. In addition, many nontariff barriers add to the cost
o f doing business and lower competitiveness, including revenue administration, tax and custom, and
infrastructure-related trade logistics such as ports and other forms o f transport. The duty drawback
system i s inefficient and impedes export diversification because o f the complexity o f the import duty
regime and lengthy administrative procedures.

Institute w i l l develop a multiyear capacity development program aimed at building negotiation s k i l l s
for handlingbilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements and related trade negotiations.
Reducing administrative barriers

54.
While Bangladesh typically requires fewer formal procedures over fewer days to
establish a business than other countries in the region, the red tape i s more formidable than
these legal requirements suggest, according to the World Bank’s Doing Business database.
Moreover, once f i r m s are operational, government agencies make frequent visits.2o Not surprisingly,
Bangladesh has received low and deteriorating scores on the World Bank Institute’s indicator o f
regulatory quality (see box 1). High regulatory costs are particularly worrying in the post-MFA
environment, where Bangladesh’s garment manufacturers need to compete with low-cost producers
in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. Adding fiuther to the cost o f doing business i s the limited
availability o f industrial and agricultural land combined with the significant government ownership

deregulation and strengthening institutions. In close cooperation with development partners, the
Bank Group w i l l pursue a program o f interventions to help streamline regulatory processes and
establish regulatory policy capacities in the Government; facilitate the provision o f land and
infrastructure services through an industrial zoning program and other initiatives; build capacity in
the Government to diagnose, formulate, and implement private sector development policies and
promotional programs (such as in the Board o f Investment, Bangladesh Export Processing Zones
Authority, Registrar o f Joint Stock Companies, and related institutions); and review labor and
environmental clearances for starting and operating businesses with a view to strengthening national
systems o f environmental and social safeguards to meet international norms. Through parallel
analytical work, the Bank plans to support the formulation o f a national strategy for land
administration and records.

4. Provide Private-Sector-Friendly Finance, Land, and Labor Markets
Enhancingfinancial intermediation

56.
Enhancing financial intermediation i s essential to support economic growth and the
private sector. The financial sector remains shallow, with bank credit to the private sector j u s t 29
percent o f GDP and very limited fmancial market penetration. Deep-rooted institutional weaknesses
hamper the intermediary role o f the banking sector: weak management, political interference, and
directed lending have resulted in a state-owned banking sector with serious performance problems.
Recent government measures have significantly strengthened the Bangladesh Bank (the central bank)
and reduced the nonperforming loans o f the four nationalized commercial banks from 34 percent to
25 percent. A relatively free licensing policy has permitted the emergence of 30 private banks and
reduced the NCBs’ share o f banking assets to 40 percent. And one o f the NCBs, Rupali Bank, i s
being brought to the point o f sale. But the financial system i s far from meeting the demands o f the
market. Microfmance institutions serve an estimated 14 million households, with a total asset base o f
1.4 percent o f GDP. These provide a welcome alternative to moneylenders, providing credit to poor
households and the possibility o f exit from poverty. For established enterprises, however, the
underdeveloped capital market l i m i t s the availability o f longer-term finance. And between these two
groups i s the “missing middle,” small entrepreneurs, rural and urban, who remain underserved by the
formal credit markets.
57.
The World Bank Group’s strategy will focus on further strengthening governance in
banking and financial sectors. Technical assistance will support strengthening o f the Bangladesh
Bank and restructuring o f the remaining nationalized commercia1 banks, with support from Bankfinanced external management teams. Partial or full divestment over the medium term i s the goal,
and the Bank may play a further role in assisting the restructuring and privatization, in cooperation
with the IMF, through investment projects and policy-based lending. The World Bank Institute w i l l
support this work by strengthening Bangladesh Bank’s capacity for research and policy analysis as
well as its capacity for combating money laundering. As the need and opportunity arise, IFC andor
the ADB may play a role as an investor in some o f the privatized NCBs. To support trade promotion
in Bangladesh, IFC w i l l provide local banks with risk coverage that extends and complements their
capacity to deliver trade fmance to their clients. In addition, IFC w i l l provide fmancing and technical
assistance to strengthen private banks and nonbank financial institutions, and w i l l continue to work
to increase access to fmance, particularly for SMEs, through SEDF’s technical assistance program,
which includes training for partner financial institutions and the Bangladesh Bank. It has been
estimated that thanks to the technical assistance provided by SEDF, partner financial institutions
have facilitated an additional $177 million in financing to SMEs over the past three years.
58.
The World B a n k Group will continue to support improvements in the regulatory
framework for microfinance activities through policy dialogue and policy-based lending.
Through analytical work and lending (as appropriate), the Bank Group w i l l support access to
microfinance for the poorest and to m e s o f m c e for SMEs. A rural finance study w i l l examine gaps

21

in financial services to fanners and small rural enterprises, and a follow-on rural finance project i s
being considered. To improve access to long-term finance, an investment promotion and finance
facility i s being developed to support public-private partnerships. To help deepen capital markets,
technical assistance i s being provided to the Government in securitizing the revenue streams o f key
revenue-earning infrastructure projects such as the Jamuna Bridge.

Strengtheningpolicies for rural growth

59.
Strengthening policies for rural growth i s key in Bangladesh’s land-constrained
environment. With nearly all available agricultural land already under cultivation, future income
and employment growth in the rural economy, where 85 percent o f Bangladesh’s 63 million poor
people live, w i l l depend almost entirely on diversification into high-value agriculture and growth in
the rural nonfarm sector. Greater backward and forward linkages and a denser rural-urban continuum
appear critical for creating more and higher-paid employment; contract farming for high-value
agriculture (given land fragmentation and very small farm size), processing o f agricultural
commodities into semifinished and finished products, and packaging, storage, and transport to urban
and export markets would all be part o f the picture. With land a scarce commodity and land
administration weak, “land grab” by powerful persons and criminal elements i s quite common, and it
i s affecting agricultural and rural growth and land use for other sectors.

60.
The Government has identified agricultural and rural development as a top priority
for generating employment and reducing poverty. The Government’s policy fi-amework has four
priorities: intensification o f mjor crops, diversification into high-value crops (horticulture),
development o f noncrop agriculture (fisheries, poultry, and livestock), and promotion o f rural
nonfarm activities (rural micro, small, and medium-size enterprises). Achieving these priorities w i l l
require addressing a number o f challenges, in particular, strengthening research and extension
systems, improving formal rural institutions, increasing the efficiency o f agricultural input and
output markets, improving the investment climate, and increasing the availability o f and access to
rural finance for SMEs. It w i l l also require addressing issues o f land management and a d n ~ s t r a t i o n
(see above), which are becoming an impediment to urban planning and development as well.
61.
The World Bank Group and i t s development partners will complement the
Government’s efforts to achieve strategic goals in agriculture and rural development. They are
providing support to improve agricultural productivity by strengthening capacities for research and
technology, improving the functioning o f agricultural markets, and promoting diversification into
such subsectors as fisheries, an important emerging export sector. Through analytical work, the Bank
also plans to support the formulation o f a national strategy for land administration, with follow-on
support for improving land administration and records. In addition, IFC’s SEDF w i l l continue a
program o f technical assistance to develop market opportunities for agribusiness SMEs.
Upgrading business-related skills and capacity for technology absorption

62.
Every survey of business emphasizes the need to upgrade labor s k i l l s and ensure that
the education system prepares graduates with skills needed by business. Also essential i s to
increase the limited ability o f enterprises to absorb technology. These are special challenges for
Bangladesh as it attempts to diversify i t s exports and compete in global markets. The Bank w i l l
support the Government in assessing the public vocational education and training system,
characterized by outdated modes o f delivering learning aid ineffective l i n k s to industry and the labor
market. The Bank also plans to provide support for vocational education and training through a
sectorwide program for secondary education. The objective would be to find ways o f improving
efficiency and developing l i n k s between the public system and industry. The Bank will also assess
the incentive regimes for absorption o f technology by enterprises, with a focus on commercializing
pro-poor innovations.

63.
I n higher education, recent policies and legislation have set some new directions, but
there i s a need to develop a clear overall strategy for the future o f the system, which includes both

22

public and private universities. A strategy for the long-term public and private funding o f the sector
i s also needed. Without these, the rapid growth in the number o f private universities i s taking place
in a policy vacuum.

64.
The Bank i s providing technical support through i t s analytical work and policy dialogue for
the development o f a strategic, long-term plan. In t h i s work it i s assisting the Government’s recently
established Strategic Planning Committee, comprising representatives from key stakeholder groups.
The strategic plan would suggest options for resolving policy concerns, such as improving the
governance and management o f the sector, including revisions to the legal framework if necessary.
The Bank also plans to provide support through a higher education project.

c.

PILLAR 2: EMPOWERING
THE POOR

65.
For all groups in Bangladesh to benefit from higher growth requires empowering poor
people, especially women, through better education, health, and nutrition and through safe water
and sanitation and clean living environments. More important, it requires poor people’s effective
participation in the country7s governing process through social inclusion and transparent and
accountable government, including at the local level.
66.
Despite Bangladesh’s progress in delivering basic public services to the poor, often through
innovative partnerships with NGOs and local communities, the unfinished agenda i s more
challenging as the country seeks to improve the quality o f these services while attaining the
ambitious Millennium Development Goals it has set itself. Improving quality requires improving
institutional accountability and incentive structures, s t i l l very weak in Bangladesh.

67.
A key reason for weak accountability i s the country’s poorly functioning, overly
centralized bureaucracy, operating within a very centralized state structure, which
undermines the accountability o f service providers to service users. Bangladesh i s regarded as
one o f the world’s most centralized countries in terms o f functional and fiscal assignments, political
decisionmaking, and the limited discretion granted to lower-level organs o f govemient in service
delivery. This centralized structure l i m i t s the ability o f citizens to participate in decisions on local
service priorities, prevents citizens from holding service providers accountable for their performance,
and leads to higher operational costs for delivering basic services to communities.
68.
A second reason for weak accountability i s that systematic mechanisms to ensure some
degree of community voice and participation and bring service users closer to service providers
are largely missing. NGOs and community-based providers, however, have been effective in
amplifymg the voice o f the poor and creating parallel channels o f service delivery.
69.
Strengthening accountability for better services i s made even more difficult by the
deteriorating quality o f the civil service and the inability o f the existing deconcentrated system to
formulate policy, follow up on implementation, and monitor outputs and performance.

70.
Further improvements in the quality of service delivery will not b e possible without
improvements in local governance structures. The recent move to strengthen lower-level local
governments deserves attention as a promising avenue-not only for improving the accountability
framework for service delivery but ultimately for a potential diffusion o f political power that may
build effective checks and balances in Bangladesh’s governing process.
71.
Assistance by the World Bank and i t s development partners will focus on improving
relations of accountability for better service delivery and local governance while also
emphasizing issues o f human security and risk management. Table 4 summarizes the results that the
World Bank aims to influence in this area during the CAS period.

23

1. Improve Access to Quality Services for the Poor through Better Accountability
Improving service delivery in health

72.
Despite Bangladesh’s progress toward health-related MDGs, challenges in the health
sector remain enormous. In child malnutrition and maternal mortality Bangladesh i s a “good
performer” compared with India or Pakistan, but the region as a whole ranks among the weakest in
the world. While polio has been eradicated in Bangladesh, tuberculosis remains problematic. The
gap in health conditions between rich and poor remains large, with children in the poorest
households, for example, twice as likely to be moderately malnourished and four times as likely to
be severely malnourished as children in the richest households. Finding cost-effective ways o f
delivering essential health services to the poor i s critical.

73.

The Government i s only partially prepared to respond to these critical challenges.
Public health service providers depend entirely on a centralized ministry in Dhaka for their career
development, and there i s no accountability to service users. Absenteeism i s rampant (almost 45
percent according to a World Bank study, similar to rates found in India and Pakistan). Facility
managers lack professionalism and independence in decision-making. Support services such as drug
supply are managed by a centralized bureaucracy that has little interface with service users. And
overlapping h c t i o n s and lack o f coordination inthe health administration result in the deterioration
o f services.

74.
The Government’s Health, Nutrition, and Population Strategic Investment Plan (200310) confvms i t s commitment to pro-poor health service provision, including reappraisal of core
functions o f the public sector. The PRSP gives special importance to reducing maternal mortality,
highlighting it as one o f the key objectives relating to the MDGs. The PRSP also emphasizes
improving equity by better targeting resources to the neediest; and restructuring service provision to
ensure efficiency by guaranteeing free provision o f emergency services and expanding health,
nutrition, and population services in urban areas.

75,
The W o r l d Bank and i t s development partners support a sectorwide program, the
Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Program, which finances an important part of the
Government’s heaith budget and focuses assistance on making service providers more
accountable to service users. The package o f essential health services i s to be revised and nutrition
made an integral part, helping poor women and children. Measures to improve service delivery w i l l
introduce a variety o f instruments, such as vouchers (for maternal health and prenatal care) and the
contracting out o f health services, with women and children expected to be major beneficiaries. The

24

contracting approach w i l l reinforce accountability through a greater reliance on communities and
union parishads (see section below on strengthening local governance) for monitoring. To
complement the sectonvide program, the World Bank Institute i s developing capacity in health
sector reform, focusing on health financing and collaboration between the public and private sectors.
A dedicated component o f the sectonvide program focuses on emerging problems o f HIV/AIDS. IFC
w i l l look for opportunities to support investments in innovative health sector projects sponsored by
the private sector.
Improving sewice delivery in primary and secondary education

76.
While Bangladesh has made impressive gains in access to education, especially
primary education, quality remains a difficult challenge. The gross enrollment ratio i s about 97
percent at the primary level, but only 43.7 percent at the secondary level and even lower at the
college and university level. The quality has deteriorated at all levels, leading to a substantial waste
o f resources through low pass rates. It i s estimated that only about 5 percent o f primary school
entrants pass the primary school examination at grade 5, the end o f the primary school cycle.
77.

Several factors account for the problems in quality, including poor teaching quality, high
student-teacher ratios, high teacher absenteeism, lack o f adequate learning materials, and
overcrowded classrooms, often operating in two shifts. Above all, weak management and
supervision impede efforts to improve quality. The primary education system remains highly
centralized, and school management committees and parent-teacher associations have not yet
become effective. Management also remains weak at the secondary level, particularly in the
nongovernment institutions that make up the majority o f secondary schools.

78.

The PRSP emphasizes the importance of education and learning for poverty reduction.

I t also emphasizes the significant improvements needed in quality and in access by the very poor.
Among i t s objectives are to make available early childhood development and preschool, not

currently part o f publicly provided education; ensure 100 percent completion in primary education;
extend education coverage; support modernization o f and quality improvements in madrassah
curricula and effectively implement quality standards; and expand secondary education by improving
access and increasing i t s relevance to the needs o f society. The PRSP also proposes actions to
improve the effectiveness and reduce the politicization o f technical and vocational education and
higher education.

79.
The World Bank’s support for education reform i s strongly focused on improving
sector governance and accountability. Inprimary education the World Bank i s part o f an ADB-led
donor group that, through the Primary Education Development Project 11, supports the Ministry o f
Primary and Mass Education’s six-year program to expand access to education and strengthen i t s
quality and effectiveness. In secondary education the Bank i s supporting improvements championed
by the Ministry o f Education through dialogue and a series o f policy-based loans. The objectives are
to increase the accountability o f secondary schools to government and to the c o m u n i t y by linking
school subsidies to objective criteria and measures o f school performance; build capacity in the
ministry to monitor performance through expenditure tracking surveys and program evaluation and
monitoring so as to guide policy; improve teacher quality by establishing an independent teacher
accreditation authority to certify eligible applicants; and enhance transparency in textbook
production through privatization. The Bank plans to follow up in these areas with a sectorwide
program on secondary education, which, as noted, w i l l include support for the vocational education
and training programs. In addition, IFC w i l l explore opportunities to support investments in
education projects sponsored by the private sector, including universities.

Improving water and sanitation

80.
Bangladesh has made good progress in improving access to safe water, moving toward
the Millennium Development Goals. The country stands out in the developing world for having
access to pathogen-free drinking water sources in some 97 percent o f i t s villages, thanks to earlier

25

govemment programs partnering with NGOs. But the recent discovery o f arsenic contamination in
some aquifers indicates that this impressive achievement i s at risk. Arsenic contamination o f
groundwater has affected an estimated 25 percent o f the shallow tube-wells in rural areas, reducing
safe water coverage to around 76 percent o f the rural population. In urban areas deterioration in solid
waste management similarly poses a serious problem for water quality. Lack o f access to safe
drinking water in both rural and urban areas, particularly for the poor, has thus become a major
emerging issue in water and sanitation services. Others are institutional inefficiency due to lack o f
clarity on the roles and responsibilities o f government and the service providing agencies;
inequitable service distribution; financing and cost recovery; and poor sector coordination.

81.
The World Bank will continue to help address rural water supply delivery through the
Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project. T h i s project focuses not only on increasing access to
safe water but also on developing an innovative service delivery mechanism by involving NGOs and
privati entities in rural piped water supply schemes. In addition, the project i s piloting a new
approach to pourashava water supply. Only about half o f all pourashavas have piped water supply
systems, leaving the rest to supply their urban population through private hand pumps. Other
development partners also are developing municipal water supply projects. Efforts by the World
Bank and i t s development partners in water supply and sanitation are geared toward supporting the
Government’s agenda o f strengthening decentralized service delivery and empowering lower-tier
levels o f govenunent. By putting service delivery in the hands o f communities, union parishads, and
pourashavas, the Government i s effectively shifting decisionmaking, responsibility, and
accountability for investments to these levels, increasing transparency and incentives to improve
service delivery and expanding options for scaling up.
82.
The major emerging issues in urban water and sanitation will be addressed during the
CAS period through a variety of approaches. These will include program to increase the quality
and quantity o f water resources around Dhaka; improve the water supply, sanitation, and drainage
systems in Dhaka and Chittagong; improve solid waste collection in selected towns; develop a model
to provide carbon finance support for urban solid waste management; and support conditions for
private sector investment in solid waste management in selected towns.

2. Improve the Effectiveness of Safety Nets
83.
The large number of poor people and the depth of poverty in Bangladesh call for
exploring how to mitigate poverty and vulnerability through safety net systems. Bangladesh h a s
a range o f formal and informal instruments to mitigate and cope with poverty, but only about 8
percent (4-5 million) o f its 63 million poor people receive some form o f social assistance. The
country’s patchwork of safety net program, all with large administrative overheads-cash transfers
and food and in-kind safety nets-target different risk groups, from the disadvantagedto the elderly
poor. Consistent with Bangladesh’s low income level, however, these programs are limited in scale
and coverage. Coupled with inefficiencies, their limited size means that these programs are not
adequate for addressing poverty or mitigating vulnerability to poverty. Moreover, the programs are
administered by a number o f ministries, with gaps, overlaps, and inadequate coordination. And the
country’s pension system i s likely to face fiscal constraints as the base pay and the average age o f the
workforce rise.21
84.
There i s a need for short- and long-term safety nets, and community-based approaches offer
special attractions. These w i l l require an integrated approach, rationalizing programs and developing
uniform targeting mechanisms. One such mechanism is proxy means testing, which scores
households on easily observed poverty characteristics-such as location, quality o f the house,
ownership o f durable goods, and the education and livelihood o f household members-to detemine
In recent years the Government has introduced a pay-as-you-go, means-testedold age payment scheme that supports more than a million
beneficiaries. The scheme seems to be well targeted but because o f limits on the number o f beneficiaries, many who qualify are excluded.

26

eligibility. The World Bank, working with the DFID, w i l l initiate studies on safety nets and pensions,
with follow-on support for social protection assistance programs as an integral component o f
development policy lending, education based lending (e.g. in the areas o f training and conditional
cash transfers) and stand alone support as appropriate.

3. Strengthen Local Governance

85.
Efforts to build accountability and improve service delivery are unlikely to succeed
without significant improvements in local governance. These would entail clarifying
intergovernmental relationships while strengthening the institutions o f community accountability to
allow citizen voice and participation in development decisions and building the capacity o f local
government structures to ensure the provision o f basic local services.
86.
Rather than a formal tier o f government, Bangladesh’s local government structures at the
district level (upazilas) are little more than the s u m o f individual central line ministries and other
service delivery structures. The lower elected levels o f government (union parishads and
pourashavas) have limited resources and little authority to raise revenues and are dominated by
higher tiers. More important, there i s a continued lack o f clarity in the assignment o f political and
administrative accountability in local governance and service provision. Local governments also
have no meaningful financial accountability: they have very limited financial and budget authority
and are not audited regularly or comprehensively.
87.
The centralized arrangements o f governance restrict the formal avenues for community
participation in local decisionmaking and for citizen oversight o f local service delivery systems.
There are also limited opportunities for participation in and oversight o f local government activities.
Seats are reserved for women in local government bodies, but female members are elected from a
larger constituency than male members and do not have a clear mandate and role. While the mere
election o f women may not in itself improve governance, it does allow for enhanced voice and
participation o f a group formerly left out o f decision-making structures.
88.
Operational accountability for local service delivery i s undermined not only by unclear
allocation o f responsibility between levels o f government. I t i s also unde-ed
by unclear division
o f roles between elected local policymakers and service providers. This leads to extensive political
interference and the fragmentation o f responsibilities for actual delivery o f services across agencies
outside a clear contracting framework. Local government structures have little strategic and technical
capacity to ensure the delivery o f basic local infrastructure and services, further undermining their
accountability to communities.
89.
The Government’s PRSP focuses on expanding the scope for pro-poor economic growth by
expanding income and employment opportunities for the poor and supporting participatory
governance by strengthening accountable and inclusive institutions o f local governance. The
Government and development partners agreed at the recent Poverty Reduction Strategy
Implementation Forum to take concrete steps to strengthen local governance, including by ensuring
that reasonable untied resources are available at the local level to respond to community priorities.
90.
The World Bank’s strategy will focus on strengthening the accountability of the lowest
tiers of government to the citizens who elect them by institutionalizing the interface between
communities and elected local governments. T h i s requires redefining the intergovernmental
compact between central and local government, strengthening the voice and client power o f citizens
so that they can hold local governments accountable for their performance, and enhancing the
technical capacity both o f local governments to ensure the delivery o f basic local services and o f
provider organizations to actually deliver them.
91.
Over the joint CAS period the Bank w i l l support the strengthening o f local governance
through dialogue and project lending by helping to clarifL the assignment o f roles, responsibilities,

27

and resources to local governments to allow them to respond to community priorities; strengthening
the capacity o f communities to hold local governments to account, through institutions and forums o f
citizen accountability at the ward level, community monitoring, and awareness building; supporting
the development o f local governments’ core technical, financial, and administrative capacities to
expand and enhance the delivery o f basic local services; and providing policy advice on strategies
and approaches to strengthen accountable local governance and service delivery systems.
92.
On the basis o f t h i s strategy, the World Bank w i l l work with development partners to
develop a common platform o f support to local governance through the CAS period. The joint CAS
partners are well placed to assist the Government intaking practical steps to redefine the assignment
of accountabilities for service delivery, to strengthen the technical capacity o f local governments and
service delivery agencies to provide services, and to support communities in engaging local
government structures to enhance their accountability. The potential for using future initiatives in
different sectors to support the strengthening o f local governance also w i l l be explored.

4. Enhance Voice and Participation through Community-Driven Development and
Other Initiatives

93.
Enhancing voice and participation as a way of strengthening accountability and
governance will be an important underlying theme of the World Bank Group’s strategy during
the CAS period. T h i s theme w i l l be reflected not only in the initiatives to enhance the role o f
communities in making formal structures o f local government more accountable (as described in the
previous section) but also initiatives to support communities directly. The design o f selected projects
throughout the portfolio w i l l also reflect this approach o f using community participation to shift and
institutionalize the responsibility for delivering and monitoring services from an external party such
as the Bank to the beneficiaries (examples include community fisheries, rural water and sanitation,
and education, health, and social protection).
94.
Bangladesh i s well known for i t s success in using NGOs and other forms o f community
organization to deliver services to poor people. But the lack o f people’s institutions at the village
level n&es i t difficult for citizens at the grassroots to ensure that their development priorities are
reflected in national policies and plans. Poverty and social assessment studies show that many
nationally implemented poverty reduction programs (for example, microcredit and safety net
programs such as food for work and development programs for vulnerable groups) have achieved
little sustained success in reducing poverty among the poorest and most vulnerable. The Social
Development Foundation, established by the Government as a nonprofit organization in 200 1, i s
designed to promote and institutionalize community-driven development initiatives.22
95.
The World Bank will expand i t s support to the Social Development Foundation as one
of the channels for enhancing voice and accountability and reducing vulnerability among the
excluded poor. The ongoing Social Investment Program Project i s using new ways o f delivering
critical small-scale infrastructure services, providing social assistance, and promoting incomegenerating activities for the rural poor while also addressing institution and capacity building at the
village level. An important objective i s to enhance poor people’s voice and participation in
development issues at the local level. The project has focused on direct financing at the village level,
to support inclusive community organizations and build downward accountability. I t s scope has
recently been expanded to address poverty in districts affected by “Monga” (famine). The Monga
pilot, to be implemented in partnership with PKSF (the apex funding organization for nlicrofmce),
w i l l be aimed at improving the immediate income o f Monga-affected families during the Monga
season.

Modeled on PKSF, Bangladesh’s renowned microfinance wholesaler, the Social Development Foundation is an autonomous
organization designed to support community-driven development, local infrastructure, and livelihoods.

Further strengthening community-driven development in Bangladesh requires
ensuring the sustainability of the participatory and service delivery approaches that have been
implemented. That means building and broadening the scope o f local governance by improving the
capacities o f local governments and institutionalizing relations between local communities and local
governments, which in tum would improve accountability and empowerment. The next phase o f the
Social Investment Program Project w i l l therefore use the CDD approach more comprehensively,
focusing on strengthening village institutions, improving the livelihoods o f marginalized and
vulnerable people, and building trust and accountability between community groups and local
govements. Results have already shown that the CDD approach can improve service delivery and
give voice to poor women and the most marginalized. These initiatives, along with the direct funding
to communities, will ensure decentralized management o f development programs at the village level
and enable poor people to expand their role in local governance.

D. CORE GOVERNANCE
97.
Much o f the agenda addressed in the two pillars i s about improving sector governance.
Improving the investment climate involves, for example, strengthening the regulatory environment
for industry and finance and removing governance impediments to investments in infrastructure.
Similarly, empowering the poor involves making government more accountable for service delivery
or infrastructure provision and strengthening local governance to bring government closer to the
people. The Bank, through i t s various instruments and in collaboration with development partners,
w i l l attempt to strengthen key institutions responsible for ensuring good governance under these two
pillars. It w i l l also attempt to strengthen demand for good governance by encouraging public
participation in policymaking and policy and program monitoring across different levels o f
government. This agenda w i l l be advanced through all Bank activities in Bangladesh, including
analytical and advisory activities (AAA), projects, and strategic partnerships with the private sector,
academia, and civil society. This mainstreamed approach means that Bank operations, whatever the
sector, w i l l be as much about governance as they w i l l be about infi-astructure provision or service
delivery.
98.
But there are clear l i m i t s to the gains from improved sector governance without
corresponding improvement in key core governance functions. Development outcomes depend as
much on addressing a set of governance issues that cut across all sectors as they do on improving
governance at the sector level. Unless revenue administration i s improved, the Government’s
revenues w i l l not increase as projected in i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy to fund pro-poor
expenditures. As noted, the low revenue effort also prevents the Government from paying civil
servants a living wage and allocating adequate resources for operations and maintenance, creating
huge incentives for corruption and poor service delivery. Similarly, a failure to address weaknesses
in public financial management systems erodes the effectiveness o f the rather modest resources
Bangladesh deploys through public expenditures (some 13.3 percent o f 2004 GDP) to fight poverty,
by encouraging waste and corruption. Equally important i s the need for better oversight and
transparency and improvements in the way public administration i s managed so as to ensure an
efficient, clean, and accountable civil service.
99.
Strengthening key institutions of accountability-including
the legal and judicial
sector, which provides a check on the executive-will also help restrain abuse of office and
reduce the risk of corruption. Reform o f the justice sector-the courts, public prosecutors, and the
police-will
be crucial in improving the investment climate, by providing predictability in the
enforcement o f contracts, supplyingthe means to settle disputes in an orderly and timely fashion, and
maintaining law and order. Such reform i s equally important to ensure access to justice for the poor
and to protect the poor, especially women, and the weak from human rights abuse and other
violations o f their personal dignity. Finally, success in improving the investment climate and
improving service delivery will depend on whether citizens and investors can hold government

29

accountable for the services it provides. As stated in the PRSP, “freeing up information itself can act
as a p o w e r l l driver for building accountability pressures and improving the governance

100. The Bank, together with i t s development partners, will help the Government o f Bangladesh
address these core governance issues. Reforms in these areas w i l l take considerable time to have an
impact. But the Bank w i l l support some clear, measurable steps, explicit and implicit in the PRSP,
that w i l l send a strong signal on the direction o f change and create a momentum for further
governance reforms in public financial management and procurement and the legal and judicial
sector (table 5).
1. Improve Public Financial Management and Procurement
101. Bangladesh has developed a reasonable track record in managing i t s fiscal balances.
The overall fiscal deficit has been steadily reduced, with the FY04 level o f 3.2 percent o f GDP
representing a big improvement on the peak o f 5 percent in FYOO and FYOl. With revenue efforts at
a low 10 percent o f GDP, the decline in the fiscal deficit primarily reflects a successll containment
o f public expenditures, particularly on the annual development plan. The decline in the fiscal deficit
has been accompanied by a secular decline in concessional foreign financing over the years, from 4.8
percent o f GDP in FY90 to 1.1 percent in FY04; it has also permitted a substantial reduction in net
domestic financing, particularly bank financing, which fell from 1.6 percent o f GDP to 0.4 percent in
FY04.
102. Without a strategic budget planning process, however, this strong performance in
maintaining aggregate fiscal discipline has come at the cost o f undermining the effectiveness and
efficiency o f public expenditure. Expenditure reductions have often been ad hoc and arbitrary, driven
by unforeseen revenue shortages and by the poor ability o f the public expenditure management
systems to properly manage such adjustments. Heavily populated countries tend to have less
government spending as a share o f GDP, reflecting economies o f scale in lower per capita costs o f
providing services. But coverage o f public services in Bangladesh i s low in many areas, and despite
the relatively modest size o f the civil service, the wage bill (broadly defined to include subventions)
tends to crowd out other expenditures, such as operations and maintenance and other nonwage public
spending.
Modernizing the National Board of Revenue

103. The revenue effort o f Bangladesh has been weak and, for the past several years,
stagnating. With a population o f 140 million, the country has only 1.4 million registered income tax
payers and 300,000 businesses registered for the value added tax (VAT). Total tax revenue amounts
to 7.4 percent o f GDP. T h i s low level reflects in part the low elasticity o f revenues with respect to
income growth due to a heavy dependence on import taxes (27 percent of total tax collections) and
numerous exemptions, tax holidays, and preferences. It i s also due in part to poor tax administration.
The revenue authority and customs have a reputation for corruption, reflecting the lack o f
accountability and weak incentives characterizing the rest o f the civil service (see para. 113). While
some progress was made in customs, taxpayers s t i l l face cumbersome processes, such as a large
number o f approvals required for customs clearance, and n ~ opportunities
y
for face-to-face contact
with revenue officials, which lead to the extraction of rents.24 The management structure i s weak,
reflecting a lack o f clear organizational direction and leadership. I t also reflects an organizational
structure based on type o f tax, which tends to duplicate functions (such as audits and collection) and
undermine the exchange o f information. More important, this structure i s inconvenient and
burdensome for taxpayers, who must deal with different units on similar issues.

The establishment o f the ASYCUDA ++ system reduced clearance times and opportunities for face-to-face interactions between customs
officials and traders.

30

The Bank i s engaged in an effort to reform the National Board of Revenue. The
Government has taken measures to improve tax collection in the short term by establishing Large
Taxpayer Units for Income Tax and VAT. I t has recently approved a strategic development plan
aimed at increasing revenue collection, developing a more effective organizational structure along
functional lines, developing legal and regulatory systems to facilitate rather than hamper trade flows,
fostering a culture o f taxpayer service, and ensuring that all businesses are treated uniformly and
equitably. The initial stages o f the plan have been supported by a DFID grant and IDA, through the
Economic Management Technical Assistance Project. The plan w i l l also be supported through
policy-based lending (DSCs) and IMF programs. A fully fledged tax administration modernization
project i s also being planned.

105. The modernization o f the National Board o f Revenue w i l l include developing new functional

including through reengineering processes supported by automation. The composition o f the

that the quality o f service improves. Surveys o f taxpayers, exporters, and the general public w i l l
monitor perceptions o f the board’s progress in improving i t s performance.
Strengtheningpublic financial management and accountability

106.
The World Bank’s recent Review of Institutional Arrangements for Public Expenditure,
Financial Management and Procurement revealed that Bangladesh’s public expenditure
institutions need to be significantly strengthened Key links in the chain o f public financial
accountability are weak. One o f the most serious weaknesses i s the lack o f a strategic planning
process, reflected in the overprogramming o f the annual development plan. T h i s lack facilitates
discretionary behavior, creates opportunities for rent seeking, and leads to too many underfunded
projects, delays in implementation, and chronic underexpenditure. Budget planning is fiagmented
between revenue (recurrent) and development (investment) budgets and preoccupied with the inputs
rather than outputs and outcomes, undermining any performance orientation. Moreover, weaknesses
in budget execution related to accounting, reconciliation with the Bank, and reporting delays hinder
transparency and create opportunities for mismanagement o f public funds. Failure to use
international accounting standards in state-owned enterprises conceals the real value o f contingent
liabilities in the budget. Internal and external controls remain weak, as reflected in the lack o f
accounting information in line ministries, delays in the publication o f audited reports, unsatisfactory
quality o f the external audits function, and ineffective parliamentary oversight o f the entire budget
process.

107. The Government has begun to address these weaknesses systematically as part of a
program of reforms supported by the DFID, World Bank, and IMF. The PRSP calls for
strengthening planning processes to avoid overprogramming, including through better project
preparation and approval processes. The Government has taken solid steps toward introducing a
Medium-Term BudgetaryFramework, piloting it in four ministries in FY06 and planning to extend it
to six additional ministries in FY07. Expenditure tracking surveys are being carried out in three
ministries to study the extent to which the amounts allocated in budgets reach the spending
authorities and beneficiaries. The Government has also rolled out a custom computerized accounting
system to 20 o f 58 district accounts offices and 7 o f 49 chief accounts offices. While the introduction
o f this system was not preceded by a redesign o f business processes, it has considerably increased
the speed with which accounts are generated and allowed the Government to produce monthly fiscal
reports. In addition, the Government has eliminated a major conflict o f interest by separating the
external audit and internal accounting functions. It now needs to make the Comptroller and Auditor
General a truly independent body, with no reliance on the Government for i t s budgetary allocations
and administrative decisions. The Public Accounts Committee o f Parliament, reestablished with IDA
support in DSC I
I
,
has begun to reduce the backlog o f audited accounts for discussion, and i t s
deliberations are beginningto be followed by the press in Dhaka.

108. Progress in improving the quality of public financial management and accountability
will be crucial for Bangladesh to meet the goals set out in i t s PRSP. The PRSP sees such progress
as a critical element in i t s anticorruption agenda. The Bank i s working with the Government to
develop a detailed action plan for raising many o f the C ratings it has received on Public Financial
Management (PFM) indicators to B ratings by the end o f the CAS period (see attachment 4). The
focus will be especially on improving performance on the indicators with a direct bearing on
transparency, financial accountability, and performance. These include indicators relating to
comprehensiveness and transparency o f the budget, such as provision o f information on budgetary
allocations and p e r f o m c e standards to enable project and program beneficiaries to monitor the
delivery o f resources and services; the effectiveness o f internal control and audit functions; payroll
controls; improvement in the quality and relevance o f external audit reports; systematic follow-up o f
key audit fmdings; and enforcement o f public sector ethics codes and asset declarations.

32

109. Progress in implementing the agreed financial management and accountability action plan
aimed at improving PFM ratings w i l l be a key indicator in judging the appropriateness of the use of
Development Policy Credits as an instrument in the Bank’s program. The Bank w i l l work with its
development partners to assist the Government in meeting the PFM standards. A Public Expenditure
and Institutional Review i s planned for FY07. Technical advice i s being planned for integrating the
PRSP into the budget through the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework and for finalizing the system
requirements o f an Integrated Financial Management Information System. And potential project
investments in Treasury computerization are being explored. Finally, the World Bank Institute w i l l
provide targeted training interventions on fiscal sustainability analysis and debt management for the
Ministry o f Finance and support to the Ministry o f Planning in poverty data analysis and MDG
monitoring to better align with the PRSP goals and indicators.
Achieving transparent and competitiveprocurement

110.
Public procurement i s a key source of corruption in many countries, and Bangladesh
has been no exception. Before reforms in recent years, procurement was subject to considerable
delays, lacked transparency, was poorly managed, and was seen as the single most important source
o f leakage o f public funds. But the Government has made good progress through these initial
reforms. For the first time it issued uniform procurement regulations that apply to all public sector
entities across the country, consistent with international procurement practices. It has introduced new
standard bidding documents and significantly reduced the layers in the procurement approval
processes. I t has put into place a unique procurement tracking and monitoring system through an
integrated management information system (MIS) now being piloted in a few agencies. The
Government i s committed to placing soon before Parliament for enactment a new procurement law
satisfactory to IDA, which covers infrastructure concessions and build-operate-transfer arrangements
(BOTS). This progress has enabled Bangladesh to secure B ratings in three o f the four PFM
indicators on procurement. Further progress cannot be taken for ganted, however, since there i s
considerable resistance to these reforms from powerful vested interests.
111. The Bank will, therefore, support a deepening of these initial procurement reforms,
including through policy-based lending @SCs) and a second Procurement Reform Project that w i l l
support implementation o f the new law once it has been passed by Parliament. The project w i l l also
support an e-procurement system aimed at enhancing transparency and efficiency for both
government and bidders. An e-procurement readiness survey will be launched shortly to help prepare
an implementation program.

112. Key to successful implementation o f a satisfactory new procurement law and full realization
o f its intent w i l l be strong compliance monitoring, not just by the Central Procurement Technical
Unit but also by civil society and NGOs through procurement watch activities. The approach to
procurement reforms w i l l include efforts to encourage behavioral change and social accountability;
mechanisms to better manage complaints from bidders, civil society, or beneficiaries; extension o f
the MIS beyond the pilot agencies to the entire government; and systematic publication and tracking
o f procurement performance indicators. Systematic outreach to the business community, including
contractors, suppliers, and consultants, w i l l be crucial to explain the new regulations and encourage
i t s full participation in and support for these reforms. The Bank w i l l support capacity building in the
Central Procurement Technical Unit and in line ministries to address t h i s large agenda and provide
training in managing government procurement and encouraging behavioral change and social
accountability.
Reforming public administration

113. An underperforming, inefficient, and weak civil service remains a constraint on service
delivery and implementation of reforms. Numerous commissions and reviews have been
undertaken, and a fairly comprehensive agenda awaits implementation. Yet progress has been slow.
As a 1996 World Bank report states,

33

there are many individuals in the Civil Service who are highly competent, but cannot
render their best because o f the Government’s compensation policies, working
environment, restrictive cadre practices and i t s practice o f deploying the available
personnel without trying to match their skills to the requirements o f the job. The pay
i s too flat, with severe below market salaries at the top and above market salaries at
the bottom, scarcity o f skills at the top, and redundant staff at the bottom. Any
reform o f the civil service has to address these anomalies?6
114.
Several factors explain the lack o f political w i l l to address these issues. The unhealthy
competition between the major political parties leads to a highly politicized civil service and means
that reforms are unsustainable when power shifts from one party to the other. The systemic
corruption i s self-reinforcing, even to the point where political parties become partly dependent on
fiinding from routine corruption in the civil service. Moreover, there are p o w e f i l internal vested
interests: the cadre system creates vertical stovepipes o f competing interests that distort departmental
and ministerial structures and restrict staff movements. Class 4 employees, at the bottom o f the rung,
are a powerful political lobby strongly resistant to more ambitious reforms.
115.
Even so, a number of public administration reforms have been implemented in recent
years. The size o f the public service and the growth o f the wage bill have been successfully
contained. A Career Planning Wing was created in the Ministry o f Establishment to focus on career
planning and effective deployment o f class 1 officers. A training policy has been issued, and training
i s now one o f the criteria for promotion o f officers. There i s greater emphasis on merit in promotion
and career development. And the Government i s considering the reestablishment o f a senior civil
service or management pool?’ These gains are laudable, though much more needs to be done to
improve the civil service. I t would nevertheless be unwise to expect much in the way o f civil service
reform until the forthcoming elections are over.
116.
The Bank will support the Government’s efforts to build on these recent modest but
important steps. The PRSP calls for improving incentives, motivation, and capacity within the
administration, particularly through a strengthened process o f recruitment (including from outside
the administration for senior-level positions), a stronger system o f rewards and punishment, and
oversight and monitoring mechanisms. Through i t s analytical and advisory services, the Bank w i l l
work with the Government to improve the caliber, effectiveness, and efficiency o f the civil service.
The Bank w i l l help establish a senior civil service.” While developing such a senior service may
take time, in the interim the Bank w i l l undertake preparatory work with the Government and i t s
partners and help strengthen the Government’s personnel management system, including through
merit- and performance-based promotions, improved postings and transfers, revised compensation,
and enhanced training. In addition, the Bank w i l l help the Government manage i t s wage bill through
analytical work to review civil service pay and compensation policy.

2. Strengthen Institutions of Accountability to Strengthen Restraints on the Executive
117.
Strengthening the key guardians o f accountability in Bangladesh, with a view to
enhancing their quality, efficiency, and independence, i s a W o r l d Bank priority. IDA has been
supporting the Bangladesh Bank through technical assistance and policy-based lending,
mWorld Bank, “Government that W W ~ V ” ,Reforming the Public Sector, Dhaka, 1996.
27 The Senior Service Pool was created in 1979 to “permit the best and the brightest” from all occupational groups to rise to the top o f the
civil service. It comprised all civil service grades above the deputy secretary level (grade 5). The pool was abolished in 1989, but a quota
system remains for entry into posts at the deputy secretary level and above.

Notwithstanding some recent relaxation o f controls on recruitment at the support staff level, the Government has been able to contain
growth o f support staff employment at class 3 and 4 levels by maintainmg a freeze on the creation o f new posts and control over the filling
o f vacant positions. In addition, inMay 2005 the Government announced a revised compensationpackage for public sector employees.
The Government has done well to award a smaller pay increase than was recommendedby the Sixth Pay Commission, containing the
budgetary impact to a level consistent with fiscal sustainability.
28

34

strengthening i t s ability to hold financial institutions accountable. I t i s also providing assistance to
the Securities and Exchange Commission to enhance i t s enforcement and regulatory capabilities in
fmancial markets. And it w i l l continue support to the Supreme Court through a follow-on project
planned for legal and judicial reform. The World Bank has also supported the establishment and
operationalization o f an Anti-Conuption Commission through policy-based lending (DSCs), while
the Asian Development Bank i s providing support to help the commission start i t s work. In addition,
the Bank i s providing support to strengthen the office o f the Comptroller and Auditor General and
may support the Public Accounts Committee. And it has been requested to support the Public
Service Commission as part o f i t s work on civil service reform.

3. Support Legal and Judicial Reform
118.
An effective legal and judicial system i s critical not only to create effective checks and
balances but also to help enforce contracts and settle disputes. Bangladesh’s justice sector suffers
from many o f the weaknesses common in developing countries. While the Constitution and laws are
generally sound, the justice system i s seen as corrupt and subject to excessive delays. There i s no
code o f conduct governing the judiciary, and court staff allegedly indulge actively in rent seeking.
The higher courts perform better, however, and the Supreme Court has remained a relative island o f
integrity, showing i t s willingness to stand up to governments. The delays in the justice system
seriously compromise i t s ability to enforce contracts and property rights: resolving a civil case takes
five years on average, from filing to the decision o f a district court. These delays lead to a huge
backlog o f pending cases. Among other things, the delays reflect a lack o f modem case management,
weak court administration, and deliberate delays by litigants, tolerated by cooperative judges, to
avoid resolution when their cases are weak. The system often lacks transparency and accountability
and encourages impunity. Access to justice for women i s particularly weak and there i s a growing
perception that violence against women i s on the rise.

119. The police are also at the heart o f the poor administration o f justice. They have been
described as a reactive force with a philosophy o f public control rather than community service. The
police are seen by average Bangladeshis as corrupt and brutal and are a source o f internal and
external concern about human rights abuses. They are also one reason for the deterioration in law
and order that has contributed to the weak investment climate.
120.
The Government has made formal commitments to reform i t s legal and judicial
system. In 2000 the Government developed a long-term strategy for legal and judicial capacity
buildingthat has guided the Bank’s initial support to the justice sector. The PRSP identifies criminal
justice reform and affordable justice for the poor as high priorities. In addition, the Government
commits itself in the PRSP to “meaningful progress on the separation o f the judiciary from the
executive” to implement a Supreme Court judgment o f 200 1, which calls for such a separation in line
with the Constitution o f Bangladesh. T h i s separation requires removing the judicial functions o f
local magistrates, who now cany out both executive and judicial functions, and developing a cadre
o f judges to take on these judicial functions.29 With support from the Bank, the Government has
initiated a pilot program to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability o f the civil
justice system and to increase access to justice for the poor.30 Elements o f the reform include
Separation of the executive and judiciary i s not an issue for the higher courts or lower courts, both of which are administratively under
the Supreme Court, not the executive branch. By contrast, the local magistrates, who carry judicial as well as executive responsibilities,
report to the executive branch. It i s estimated that some 600 judges need to be identified, hired, and trained to replace the current
magistracy, a task that will take some time. A judicial service commissionwas recently established as a first step.
29

30 A $30.6 million Legal and Judicial Capacity Building Project financed by IDA was approved by the Board on March 29, 2001.
Amendments to the Civil Procedure Code relating to court-facilitated mediation and others aimed at reducing delays in case processing by
imposing sanctions for dilatory tactics and modernizing and expediting service of summons have done much to help reduce the number of
cases going to trial and shorten case processing times. A limited computer management system intmduced in the pilot courts has helped to
increase transparency and improve court administration. The project also supported implementation of the New Money Loan Court Act
2003, which has vastly improved loan recovery mechanism by providing for summaty procedures, empowering banks to sell the collated
o f defaulters in public auctions, and e m p o w e g courts to enforce judgments. The Canadian International Development Agency i s

35

strengthening court administration and reducing delays by improving case management through an
automated management information system, strengthening judicial training, and upgrading facilities
and other human resource needs in five pilot districts and the Supreme Court. The Government also
aims to improve access to justice through a newly institutionalized alternative dispute resolution
mechanism, which allows quicker resolution o f cases outside the courts by improving access to legal
aid and promoting legal literacy and public awareness at the grassroots level. A midterm review o f
this project i s under way and will be used to help evaluate ways o f making faster progress injudicial
reform.

121. Given the lack o f public demand for reforms, however, progress on this front w i l l prove
difficult. While pilot reform programs to improve judicial administration are important initial steps,
they are not enough to address the weak incentive structure at the root o f many dyshctionalities o f
the justice system. The rule o f law i s not in the interests o f clientelist politics because it reduces the
need for clients to seek the help o f patrons in resolving disputes or enforcing contracts. The Bank,
with i t s development partners-particularly the Canadian International Development Agency,
Danida, and the European Community-will work on ways to strengthen the demand for legal and
judicial reforms and help build a broad national consensus on the need for such reforms and on
priorities for justice sector reforms. This effort w i l l center on encouraging and facilitating a dialogue
within the justice sector and between the justice sector and civil society, academia, and politicians.
One o f its aims w i l l be to develop a road map o f concrete technical steps required to extract the
executive branch at the local level from i t s judicial responsibilities. This exercise w i l l complement
the work o f development partners in the broader criminal justice sector. This includes work by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), DFID and Japan to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency o f the Bangladesh police by supporting key areas o f access to justice, human resource
management and training, and prevention, investigation, and prosecution o f crime.
4. Strengthen Demand for Reform and Enhance Access to Information

122. Experience in other countries suggests that governance reforms best succeed when
society demands them, not when the reforms are imposed by external actors. A central focus o f
the Bank’s energies (and those o f i t s development partners) w i l l be to help further strengthen voice,
empowerment, and participation in a country where civil society has made huge strides in a very
short time. The Bank w i l l increasingly work with civil society, academia, and think tanks to help
build consensus around governance reforms and to monitor progress in governance. It w i l l
increasingly partner with civil society and academia in analytical work on issues o f governance and
in the production and dissemination o f high-quality information on the extent, incidence, and
consequences o f corruption. Over time this engagement w i l l help strengthen the public’s perception
o f the need for governance reforms and increase the pressure on govements to undertake such
reforms.
For civil society to engage with government on the quality and efficiency o f public
institutions, it w i l l be important to address the relatively limited formal access to information held by
public authorities in what i s otherwise a very open society. This access remains limited because there
are few institutional mechanisms through which citizens can obtain such information. The PRSP sees
addressing this issue as “the most important entry point” for enhancing accountability and
transparency. It sees a freedom o f dormation law as an important long-term goal. Such a law would
provide citizens with a legally enforceable right to obtain, through clearly defined procedures,
information held by government on matters o f public concern. It would also encourage government
to publish information about i t s activities. As in other jurisdictions, a freedom o f information law
should explicitly supersede the Official Secrets Act where there are any inconsistencies. The work o f

supporting legdative drafting and legal reform. By 2006 i t i s expected that there wll be a database contaung all of Bangladesh’s primary
legslation of general application, accessible to the public from the Ministry of Law’s Web site.

36

the National Law Commission on the proposed Right to Information Act 2002 was a first step
toward such a law.
124. The Bank’s analytical work will explore how the public’s access to information can be
enhanced and how greater transparency can be brought to the budget, public procurement,
and the public policymaking process as a means o f stimulating demand for reforms in governance,
including through watchdog NGOs. The Bank w i l l support g o v e m e n t efforts to strengthen ICT and
apply e-governance initiatives in key sectors. The Bank w i l l also work with i t s partners to help bring
about attitudinal changes among civil servants so that they see themselves as “servants o f the people”
and are encouraged to be open and transparent in their work. Participatory analytical work in this
area, undertaken with development partners, w i l l feed a national debate on the role o f information in
development, contribute to a national information policy, and potentially lead to a freedom o f
information act. The World Bank Institute, through i t s Media, Information, and Governance
Program, seeks to build the capacity o f Bangladesh’s Public Information Department to manage and
disseminate information and the capacity o f the media to access government information, with a
focus on excluded groups such as rural women, indigenous populations and char-land dwellers. This
work, in conjunction with the work o f development partners active in governance and transparency,
w i l l help strengthen the capacity o f the media and civil society to access and analyze greater
information flows, enabling them to better educate the public. The work w i l l also help beneficiaries
at the local level monitor access to budgetary information on resources available and service
delivery. The World Bank Institute also plans to strengthen the capacity o f the Government’s
National Institute o f Mass Communications to continue training and capacity development activities
in governance and transparency over the long term.

125. The roots of many of Bangladesh’s current problems of governance lie in areas outside
the Bank’s m a n d a t e t h a t is, in political governance. The cost o f getting elected in Bangladesh i s
said to be among the highest,inthe world relative to income, and campaign fmancing i s thus thought
to be a major source o f corruption. One contributing factor i s the limited enforcement o f laws and
regulations relating to the declaration o f assets and liabilities o f high public officials and the failure
to make such declarations public. Recognizing this, the G o v e m e n t has agreed to review the
implementation o f the relevant legislation and policies, recommend necessary actions, and make the
review public. There are also major issues o f intraparty democracy, which l i e at the root o f the
present confkontational politics. Unless and until these issues are addressed, other reforms cannot
fully succeed. I t i s in these areas o f political governance reform, including strengthening political
competition and ensuring free and fair elections that the Bank intends to rely on i t s bilateral
development partners to engage the Government in dialogue and provide support. With t h i s in mind,
the Bank i s in active dialogue with these partners on strengthening their efforts to support such
governance reforms.

E. LONGER-TERM
STRATEGIC ISSUES
126. The CAS touches on a number o f longer-term issues. Upgrading agricultural research,
evaluating future directions for higher education, strengthening local governance, and strengthening
institutions o f accountability are among the issues with long-term implications for Bangladesh’s
development. As Bangladesh enters i t s election cycle, there i s a significant risk that many such
important policy issues now at the top o f the development agenda w i l l take a back seat.
127. This potential fallow period for the Bank’s policy dialogue also creates an opportunity to
take an integrated view o f some o f the development challenges that Bangladesh’s economy will face
over the next several decades. High among these will be environmental issues. Natural resources
have provided the platform for much o f Bangladesh’s economic development and growth. The
wetlands sustain abundant fisheries that provide 60 percent o f the country’s protein consumption,
while forests and natural vegetation remain the primary source o f cooking fuel for the bulk o f the
country’s population. But there are growing signs o f declining natural resource and ecosystem

37

productivity, threatening the country’s poverty reduction efforts and longer-term growth prospects.
In addition, rapid urbanization-including the high population concentration in Dhaka, likely to
become one o f the world’s most populous cities-has generated a litany o f environmental problems
that accentuate poverty through environmental health risks associated with deteriorating air and
water quality and sanitation problems. Indiscriminate discharge o f industrial effluents to ground and
surface water and weak enforcement o f environmental regulations pose a significant threat to
ecological balance as well as serious health risks, particularly among the vulnerable and the urban
poor. Developing a strategy to deal with environmental problems (including the eastern rivers) and
an understanding o f the drivers o f urban growth would enable Bangladesh to better cope with i t s
projected population o f 250 million in 2050.

128. Diversification o f Bangladesh’s economy from i t s current export dependence on garments
w i l l also be a major issue and i s the subject o f an ongoing Bank study on constraints to long-term
growth. On the social side maintaining progress toward the MDGs and looking beyond 2015 to
progress over the next 25 years w i l l determine the policy priorities over the next decade. And above
all, building the institutions that w i l l guide and shape the politics and economy o f Bangladesh in the
21st century w i l l be at the heart o f any long-term development perspective.
129. The Bank w i l l work with i t s development partners and with leading academic and policy
research institutions in Bangladesh to revisit the challenges o f longer-term development in the
country. I t will use the inevitable interregnum imposed by the political calendar to encourage a
debate in Bangladesh society on key long-term development issues and help shape directions for
future work that would influence the policy and development directions in future PRSPs. The Bank
also plans to prepare policy notes for the incoming government-an agenda for i t s future support.

IV.

DELIVERY OF THE WORLD BANK PROGRAM: LEARNING FROM RECENT
EXPERIENCE
A. LESSONS
LEARNED31

130. The strategy during the last CAS (F‘YO1-03) was one of a graduated response to
Bangladesh’s development challenges, operating mainly in a low case and shifting into the base
case as the pace o f reforms accelerated with the new government that came to power in 2001. A
strategic shift began in FY03, when the f i r s t development policy loan-after several years o f lowlevel engagement-was approved by the Board o f Executive Directors following significant progress
on public expenditure, financial management and procurement, banking, and state-owned enterprise
reforms. Good policy performance has continued and has been supported through follow-up
Development Support Credits. The Bank has pursued a more strategic, policy-level engagement
since then, and i t s relations and level o f dialogue with the country have improved as a result.
131.
On the outcomes outlined in the F Y O l CAS, the Bank effectively supported human
development and economic growth but was less successful in helping to promote governance
improvements and r u r a l development. Delivery o f the Bank’s assistance was affected by i t s
limited engagement in several key sectors, including infrastructure. Moreover, poor understanding o f
country conditions and the political economy o f refonns constrained the Bank in developing a
responsive country program, with the result that a disconnect emerged between the lending program
and analytical work. The Quality Assurance Group viewed the lending program as not sufficiently
broad based, while at the project level the Operations Evaluation Department found that outcomes
had been mostly satisfactory.
132. Indeed, disengaging from such critical sectors as banking, power, and water hindered
achievement of CAS outcomes and development of the country program. And despite the focus
31 T h i s sechon summarizes findings from the last CAS Completion Report presented in attachment 6 (pages 86-123)

38

on governance, the Bank was unable to support the country in key areas o f public administration
reform, decentralization, and anticorruption. The Bank’s strategy might have appeared appropriate at
the time, given governance challenges and the policy stance in some sectors. In retrospect, however,
the extent o f disengagement envisaged during the last CAS appears excessive considering
Bangladesh’s overall economic and social performance.
133. Lessons were also learned for the Bank’s analytical work. The Quality Assurance Group
found the quality o f individual tasks to be consistently good, a conclusion confirmed by the 2004
Client Survey, whose respondents said that the Bank was effective in producing knowledge.
Respondents were less positive about the Bank’s ability to adapt i t s knowledge to Bangladesh’s
needs, however. On this aspect the Quality Assurance Group found that the AAA program lacked
client input on i t s scope and that preparation o f reports lacked client participation. It also faulted the
AAA program for poor dissemination.

134.
Similar messages consistently emerged from the Bank’s extensive CAS consultations with
different segments o f Bangladesh society, the Government, the private sector, academia, civil
society, and the donor community (see attachment 5). All emphasized the need to pay attention to the
political economy o f reforms and country-specific circumstances to support the design o f more
effective interventions.‘ They also strongly expressed the need for the Bank to strengthen i t s own
fiduciary requirements and to minimize possibilities for corruption in i t s own projects.
135.
Going forward, the country strategy will incorporate the lessons learned from the last
CAS and more recent experience (box 4). The Bank Group w i l l need to operate differently in the
face o f the challenges it confronts. First, it w i l l need to pay better attention to local conditions and
realities, avoiding routine solutions to country-specific challenges and helping to promote a common
view and approach around critical policy issues, especially on goveniance. Second, a particularly
difficult challenge in Bangladesh, the Bank Group w i l l need to recognize the fiduciary r i s k
environment in which it operates and take adequate measures to mitigate the risk.
Box 4. Lessons from the Last CAS and Recent Experience
To enhance the development impact, it is important to remain engaged and able to respond as opportunities arise
even when the refoms appear dzficult to achieve. A more positive and constructive level o f engagement has
proved more effective in pushing reforms. Moreover, reengaging in a sector after years without dialogue and
lending i s usually more difficult and costly.
Development policy lending has effectively supported the Government’s rejopm agenda and helped to deepen
po Iicy dialogue across several critical sectors.
There is a need to pay close attention to the political economy of reforms and develop realistic expectations about
their scope and pace. CAS implementation showed that, given country conditions, reforms cannot always be
advanced comprehensively and at an even pace. Nevertheless, the Government’s commitment to reform resulted in
measurable progress in key areas even though the reform agenda could not be pursued equally across all sectors.
Governance is an area where a positive and constructive approach-moving from rhetoric to concrete, practical
support-would
likely yield better results. In practical terms, this means unbundling governance issues to
implementable levels, gaining more in-depth understanding o f these issues, and going beyond traditional areas of
past engagement.
The country program supporting CAS outcomes should be especially responsive to client capabilities and
institutional capacities. Simultaneously, the program needs to be selective while maximizing partnerships with
development partners. “Good local fit” based on a thorough institutional analysis should be particularly
emphasized.
The Bank needs to develop a more strategic and, when relevant, progpammatic view of analytical and advisory
activities (MA), linking the AAA program clearly to the CAS outcomes and focusing on governance in everything
it does. Sector work should be better aligned with lending development, while analytical work should be developed
in parallel to support the reform agenda, focusing particularly on how to implement specific, difficult reforms.
Involvement o f the client should be enhanced, and opportunities for partnerships with other donors actively sought.

39

B. WHAT THE WORLD BANK WILL DO DIFFERENTLYAND BOW
136. The key lessons from recent experience and the results of the CAS consultations call for
the Bank Group to do a number o f things differently:

First, the Bank w i l l ensure that the results focus o f the CAS i s reflected in everything it does
in Bangladesh, from lending and AAA to the way it manages fiduciary risks.
Second, the Bank w i l l make governance a central focus o f i t s work, influencing decisions
about sectoral priorities, the composition o f Bank lending and AAA, and the type o f
instruments deployed.

Third, the Bank w i l l attempt to systematically involve beneficiaries and affected
communities inthe design and implementation o f all its activities.
Fourth, the Bank w i l l seek to build strong partnerships with academia, civil society, and the
international donor community.

Fifth, the Bank w i l l become increasingly open and transparent in the way it does business,
enhancing disclosure and reaching out to all sections o f Bangladesh society and thus
positioning itself to become a reliable long-term development partner o f Bangladesh.
Finally, the Bank will step up i t s efforts to strengthen fiduciary safeguards in the projects
and programs it funds and reduce fiduciary risk even as it continues to proactively manage
the portfolio and improve implementation (see section IV.E).

A governance-oriented CAS will require new ways of doing business to ensure effective
implementation, with shifts in staffing, institutional processes, and culture (see following sections).
Staffing adjustments w i l l start with key members o f the Bangladesh country team. A governance
adviser w i l l be hired in FY06; a Dhaka-based legal and judicial reform adviser has been hired; and
Dhaka-based positions for an operations adviser and lead economist with a strong focus on
governance w i l l be advertised in FY06/07. New sector team members with strong governance
experience w i l l also be sought.
138.
Institutional processes will be reoriented to ensure a governance dialogue throughout
project and AAA preparation. Following good practice in other Bank Regions, an operations risk
management team i s being established to provide peer advisory services on core and sector
governance issues, allow greater knowledge sharing across teams, and institute early warning
systems for high-risk projects (see section IV.E). Country-specific policies already in place require
early inception notes for all projects and AAA before formal allocation o f budgets. The inception
notes require teams to outline governance risk issues early in the concept stage. A series o f sectorspecific political economy and govemance studies have been initiated, such as the one for the
Chittagong port and an upcoming study o f the power sector.
139. Feedback from clients and from other donors points to the need for more transparent
business practices in Bangladesh to ensure effective partnerships, reduce perceptions of
corruption, and encourage voice and participation. The Bank’s program has recently benefited
fiom a more strategic external affairs engagement. A new external affairs manager has been hired,
and outreach efforts are being scaled up. A new “Bangladesh Development Series” capturing all
Bangladesh-related analytical work i s being provided to a broad distribution l i s t o f donors,
government, and civil society. Similarly, the Bank i s expanding i t s program-specific dialogue with
civil society, academia, parliamentary bodies, and the private sector through an enhanced World
Bank Institute program. And to ensure maximum voice and participation, many o f the Bank’s new
programs have a strong focus on community involvement. These include local governance, urban
development, and social protection.

40

140.
The most difficult change will be cultural. The country team w i l l hold a retreat soon after
approval o f the CAS to internalize the priorities and governance orientation. This CAS w i l l require
greater cross-sectoral work, stronger country team alignment on acceptable risks, and a clear
understanding o f expectations relating to governance within projects and AAA. The process o f
cultural change will be continuous, with follow-on activities including workshops with other
development partners and the Government. The country team w i l l discuss incentives for promoting
good governance in project design and best-practice monitoring during supervision. Similarly, an
effort i s being undertaken to forge team synergies among key governance sectors, such as between
urban development and local governance or between legal and judicial reform and work on growth
and economic management.

e.

LENDING
AND WORLD BANKGROUP INSTRUMENTS-A

STRATEGY OF ENGAGEMENT

1. World Bank Lending and Analytical and Advisory Activities
141.
Under the 14th replenishment o f IDA resources (DA14) Bangladesh’s performance-based
allocation for FY06 i s $750 million. A s i m i l a r annual average has been assumed for the CAS
period.32This volume o f lending takes into account the governance ratings for Bangladesh built into
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) as well as portfolio performance. It also
reflects the “governance factor” integral to the performance-based allocation formula, so that
governance factors weigh heavily in Bangladesh’s IDA allocation. This level o f lending w i l l allow
the Bank Group sufficient resources to follow a strategy o f strong engagement to address
Bangladesh’s key development constraints through a range o f instruments. These w i l l include
development policy lending, investment lending, and interventions that transfer resources directly to
the poor, including CDD-based or local government capacity building operations, positioning the
Bank as a long-term partner in supporting Bangladesh’s poverty reduction agenda.
142.
The strong governance filter on the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy w i l l have significant
implications for the lending program (see attachment 9 and Annex B3). The Bank w i l l continue to
engage the Government on policy and institutional reforms supported by Development Support
Credits and Poverty Reduction Support Credits, planned to comprise around 30-40 percent o f total
lending. These instruments have proved highly effective in supporting strategic reforms across a
range o f sectors and institutions and have given the Bank access to the highest levels o f decision
making (attachment 10). But it w i l l increasingly focus these budgetary support operations on
improving sector and core governance. Moreover, access to these credits and to any sector policy
operation w i l l be conditioned on four economic management and governance-related benchmarks
that are key to creating an enabling environment for more effective use o f the Government’s
budgetary resources and Bank-fianced budgetary support:

.
.
.

Maintaining macroeconomic stability, including adhering to the targets establishedunder
the agreed macroeconomic framework supported under IMF programs.
Meeting the revenue targets established under the PRSP’s macroeconomic framework,
as revised under the Government’s agreements with the IMF.
Achieving satisfactory progress on the annual benchmarks to be established under the
agreed Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework, which
would be aimed at improving Bangladesh’s P F M ratings over the medium term?
Enacting a new procurement act satisfactory to IDA and satisfactorily implementing
procurement reforms as agreed in the PEFA framework and past development policy
lending operations.

The Bank’s support for Bangladesh’s investment operations w i l l also have a strong governance filter.
All support to investments in a sector will address the key governance and institutional constraints to
IDA allocations for the outer years are indicative and will be subject to Bangladesh’s performance every year as well as to overall IDA
resources.
32

41

that sector. In particular, infrastructure operations w i l l attempt to enhance the transparency and
accountability o f private provision o f infrastructure.
143. All new projects and programs will attempt to systematically involve beneficiaries and local
communities in their design and implementation. Beneficiary monitoring o f outcomes w i l l be key in
ensuring a strong focus on results in the Bank’s program. In addition, as noted, the Bank w i l l
increasingly rely on CDD-type operations or projects with CDD components to deliver rural
infrastructure and social services, relying on communities to prioritize needs. To reduce the risks o f
leakage o f funds, Bank-funded programs will institutionalize a s h i f t in the responsibility for holding
public officials accountable from external third parties such as the Bank to local communities, which
stand to lose the most from a failure to deliver on program and project objectives.
144. If a deterioration in policy performance or governance failures should make it difficult to
reach agreement on the policy program underlying Development Support Credits or, througli lower
CPIA ratings, lead to a reduction in resources available to Bangladesh, the Bank will rely
increasingly on CDD-type projects to reach poor communities in Bangladesh to ensure that lower
resource transfers do not adversely affect i t s poor.
145. The Bank’s analytical and advisory activities will also be managed more strategically,
to support and inform policy and governance reforms, feed into Bank lending operations, and reach
out to key constituencies in Bangladesh by widely disseminating major analytical products translated
into Bengali. In its AAA the Bank w i l l attempt to focus systematically on the political economy o f
reforms, address governance constraints in the sectors and thematic areas covered, carry out
governance assessments o f key institutions that it may wish to support, position itself on key
development and governance issues, and help build consensus for reforms. The Bank w i l l also use
AAA to provide technical and advisory support through focused policy notes, particularly to the new
government. In addition, the Bank will increasingly use AAA to work with local policy think tanks
and academic institutions to foster debate and dialogue in Bangladesh, particularly on sensitive
governance issues, and to build local capacity for policy analysis. Given the cross-cutting nature o f
the development agenda, the Bangladesh country team w i l l establish cross-sectoral thematic groups
that collectively prioritize and manage AAA work and take accountability for delivering genuinely
cross-sectoral work (see annex B4).
146.
The Bank’s AAA i s expected to play an especially important role in FY07, when the policy
dialogue with the Government could slow as the country heads toward an election and the related
political uncertainty and policy vacuum. The Bank intends to use this period to undertake joint
studies with local institutions aimed at developing a better understanding o f longer-term issues in
danger o f being neglected by policymakers-issues in such areas as the environment (including the
impact o f global warming), governance, higher education, urbanization, and cross-border regional
integration (see section III.E).

2. IFC Program
147. On December 31, 2005, IFC’s held portfolio in Bangladesh stood at $132.5 million in nine
projects. O f this, $102.9 million i s for IFC’s own account and $29.6 million for B-loan participants.
The projects span a range o f sectors, including power, telecommunications, cement, and financial
markets. IFC w i l l continue to provide equity, long-term debt, and guarantees in support o f local and
foreign private investment. IFC will also continue substantial programs o f technical assistance
through SEDF and FIAS, focusing on developing SMEs, improving the investment climate, and
promoting foreign direct investment.

42

3. MIGA Program
148. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Bangladesh consists o f five contracts o f guarantee in the
manufacturing and telecommunications sectors with a gross exposure o f $112.1 million (around 2.3
percent o f MIGA’s total exposure). MIGA recently underwrote an investment by an Egyptian
investor in the telecommunications sector totaling $79.2 million. During the CAS period MIGA
plans to support foreign investors in the telecommunications, infrastructure (power), and natural
resources sectors. It will focus i t s technical assistance program on helping to build the capacity o f the
main government institutions focusing on private sector development, principally the Board o f
Investment. MIGA w i l l deliver a range o f technical assistance services designed to enhance the
board’s capacity to promote Bangladesh as a location for foreign direct investment, to address
investors’ needs during the investment process, and to develop effective investor aftercare and policy
advocacy functions. MIGA will also work with the World Bank and IFC to build the capacity o f the
Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority.

4. Expenditure Eligibility under the Country Assistance Strategy
149.
Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) for Bangladesh were approved on May 13,2005 (see
attachment 8). Under the CFPs IDA may finance up to 100 percent o f the costs o f individual
operations, but counterpart funds w i l l be encouraged. Cost sharing arrangements w i l l be determined
case by case, taking into account several factors. These include the Government’s program and
budget for the relevant sector, alignment with PRSP and CAS priorities, project context and impact
o f the cost sharing arrangements on project implementation and achievement o f development
objectives, implications for the CAS envelope, and other potential sources o f financing. The
application o f the CFPs i s based on the grounds that the Government has followed prudent fiscal and
debt management policies and has shown i t s commitment to implementing the country’s PRSP.
Nevertheless, the increased flexibility i s expected to be used in well-justified cases and with careful
consideration o f sustainability risks. Moreover, in applying the proposed financing parameters, the
Bank w i l l continue to ensure that all Bank-supported projects include adequate fiduciary
management and oversight arrangements consistent with the governance strategy o f the CAS.

D. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
AND PERFORMANCE
150. Bangladesh’s portfolio performance, much weaker in the recent past, i s now broadly in
line with the average for South Asia and for all IDA-only countries. In FY05 the disbursement
ratio for Bangladesh’s portfolio, at 23 percent, was s i m i l a r to the IDA average and substantially
higher than the 10 percent disbursement ratio for the ADB’s broadly s i m i l a r portfolio. The share o f
projects at risk i s lower than the IDA average, and project outcomes are broadly satisfactory (table 6;
for recent trends, see annex B2).
151. Despite recent progress, however, project implementation continues to be slow, and the
country portfolio continues to have a large undisbursed amount, totaling $1.5 billion at the end o f
FY05. The average project implementation period has continued to increase, growing from 2.8 years
in FY02 to 3.6 in FY05.33This increase i s to some extent a result o f the growing number o f project
extensions. InFY05, for example, Bangladesh had 10 project extensions, out o f a total o f 35 in South
Asia.

33

The average implementationperiod i s measuredby the Bank as the average age o f projects in the country portfolio (see annex B2).

e. Represents the difference betweenthe Development Objective ratings in the final Project Summary Report or Implementation Summaxy
Report and those in the OED evaluation of the project.

152.
The main factors influencing portfolio performance, as noted in the CAS Completion Report
(see attachment 6), have been inadequate government ownership o f and commitment to project
objectives and project design, which have often been overambitious and thus difficult to achieve;
delays in project start-up due to, among other things, weak preparatory work, particularly on the
recruitment o f project consultants and government approval o f projects; weak implementation
capacity; poor procurement management and inadequate public sector accountability; insufficient
attention to the political and institutional context o f projects; lack o f realism and weak quality o f
reporting in supervision; and poor monitoring and evaluation systems.

153.
Portfolio performance has also been affected by decisions to extend several at-risk projects
(some o f them actual problem projects), or to postpone partial credit cancellations, in order to
support program development objectives. For example, $200 million in emergency financing for
2004 post-flood rehabilitation was reallocated from three at-risk or problem projects whose
remaining balances would otherwise have been canceled.
154. On the Bank’s human resource side, the departure o f key staff from the Dhaka office, and
the consequent loss o f mentoring and senior expertise, may have weakened the ability o f the Country
Office to play i t s expected role in project implementation and supervision. Reconstituting the
staffing pattern, including posting to the Country Office senior international staff with responsibility
for key sectors o f engagement, w i l l be an important human resource feature o f the strategy.

155. The Government and the Bank have responded to these issues, achieving some initial
positive results, Besides the overall efforts to improve procurement and financial management, as
agreed aRer the FY04 Joint Country Portfolio Performance Review, the Government, supported by
development partners including the Bank, has taken several initiatives to improve project
iniplementation. These include establishing a more streamlined project approval process, including
the new “Development Project Proposal”; ensuring better recruitment o f consultants by introducing a
consultant recruitment monitoring system, adopting an action plan to expedite recruitment o f
consultants in two key line ministries, and requiring early preparation o f complete consultant
invitation documents; and strengthening monitoring and evaluation, with a special focus on the
Internal Monitoring and Evaluation Department, the agency responsible for implementing
monitoring and evaluation o f development projects. While progress has been made on each o f these

44

fronts, critical issues remain, largely due to the limited delegation o f authority to line ministries and
implementing agencies that s t i l l prevails.34
156. At the same time the World Bank has been working with line ministries and implementing
agencies in developing and maintaining systems for monitoring and evaluation o f project
performance and in using the available data to identify areas o f lagging performance. In addition, the
Bank has been closely monitoring project and portfolio progress and regularly providing the
Government with a consolidated l i s t o f upcoming due dates and deadlines.
157. Fiduciary issues have also been prominent concerns across the portfolio. Indeed, with
governance weak and corruption levels high, there are considerable r i s k s to the Bank’s portfolio in
Bangladesh. Delays occur in implementation as documents and decisions are reviewed and rereviewed at various levels within government, since government budget and human resource
management systems include layers o f formal sign-offs and other types of protection against
malfeasance but relatively few incentives to achieve real results. Tracking studies suggest evidence
o f leakage, generally, from the social sector programs financed by the Bank and other donors.
Procurement post-reviews, a recently completed independent procurement review o f selected
projects and INT investigations have indicated irregularities under some Bank operations. In
addition, the Bank has undertaken assessments o f the country’s financial management and
procurement systems through various studies (see para 159) and paid particular attention during the
last CAS period to strengthening the Government’s own systems.
158. Learning from these efforts and cognizant o f recent cases under investigation or scrutiny, the
Bank w i l l again give this area particular attention during the upcoming CAS, as described in the
following section.

E. MANAGING THE WORLD BANK’SFIDUCIARY
AND IMPLEMENTATION RISK
159. The Bank’s efforts during the last CAS period to help strengthen the Government’s fiduciary
risk management began with a Country Financial Accountability Assessment c*ed out in 2001 and
a Country Procurement Assessment in 2002. These led to Bank support for government procurement
and financial management reforms, resulting in considerable progress on procurement and modest
but systematic progress on financial management. As discussed (see section III.D), the CAS w i l l
further strengthen the Bank’s support for these reforms. These institution building efforts w i l l take
time to have an impact, however, and in the meantime the Bank needs to significantly deepen i t s own
fiduciary risk management.
160. Recognizing this, the Bank recently completed a retrospective review o f independent audits
o f procurement under eight projects undertaken for the Bank by external consulting fums over the
past four years and a sample of external audit reports o f Bank-financed projects. The review revealed
frequent instances o f probable collusion in bidding, made possible by poor procurement practicesincluding insufficient time allowed for bidding, delays in tender evaluation, lack o f transparency in
bidding, inadequate bid securities, and the like. Other findings included poor record keeping and
documentation by project entities, including inadequate documentation to support variation from the
contract amount during implementation or to support claims against statements o f expenditures. The
Bank responded by declaring misprocurement in some cases and by taking other actions that were
mainly project specific.
161.
While the Government has a set o f sound regulations that w i l l soon be reflected in
procurement law, implementation o f the intent o f the new law w i l l be key. The Bank, through i t s
lending and dialogue, w i l l support such implementation, but achieving progress on t h i s and on
34 Project approval remains highly centralized, and there are strict limits on deviations from approved plans. Moreover, changing or
replacing consultants financed by external resources i s still beyond the authority o f line ministries and agencies.

45

financial management i s likely to remain a challenge for some time. Under the new CAS the Bank i s
developing and will begin the implementation o f a rolling Operational Risk Mitigation Plan that w i l l
strengthen i t s capacity to manage risk systematically throughout i t s portfolio, including through
retrofitting ongoing operations as feasible. This strategy w i l l comprise the following key building
blocks:

.

.

.

.
.

Systematic analysis of comption risk through AAA and in project preparation. The Bank
w i l l integrate a corruption focus in assessing the capacity o f the country and project
authorities to manage procurement and financial management, including agency information
and documentation management practices; the quality o f governance in key institutions in
the sector or program being supported; the Bank’s past experience with these agencies; and
the incentives and disincentives for corrupt behavior among the key stakeholders. This
enhanced knowledge should assist the Bank in better addressing corruption risks (see
below). I t w i l l also result in the Bank staying away from institutions unwilling to address the
issues raised in such diagnostic work. Diagnostics in other countries suggest that
community-driven programs bolstered by social accountability measures may be less
susceptible to corruption. The Bank accordingly plans to direct an increasing share o f new
lending to such programs, where the onus o f responsibility for holding public officials
accountable i s institutionalized in local communities and the beneficiaries o f such programs,
facilitated by Bangladesh’s strong NGO sector.
Smart project design. If the corruption risk assessment shows that the m i n i s t r y or agency
managing a project would, with some help in addressing i t s weaknesses, be an appropriate
partner for the Bank, the next step would be to design the Bank-supported intervention so as
to reduce corruption risks. Supply-side measures that address institutional weaknesses and
ensure implementation o f the Government’s new procurement policies-including making
systematic use o f e-procurement, improving procurement planning, and ensuring that the
outside members on bid evaluation committees hold the process to appropriate standards o f
integrity-will need to accompany demand-side measures that allow adequate oversight o f
procurement, financial management, and project outcomes by beneficiaries, NGOs, and civil
society in general. The Bank w i l l work to systematically improve procurement practices by
promoting the use o f e-procurement and improved procurement planning. And whenever
appropriate, it w i l l use the dynamic Procurement R i s k Model in project preparation.
Stronger supervision. Beyond the regular project supervision that addresses policy and
institutional issues, the Bank w i l l undertake each year, beginning in FY06, an integrated, indepth technical, procurement, and financial management review o f projects with high
fiduciary risk. This review can include sampling contracts, visually inspecting the actual
delivery o f work, following up on audit findings and recommendations, and reviewing
interim financial management reviews. The Country Portfolio Performance Review w i l l
sharpen i t s focus on comption issues. The country team w i l l work with the Department o f
Institutional Integrity to develop a procedure for more effectively addressing complaints
relating to corruption.
More systematicpursuit of remedies. The Bank will be more rigorous in identifying red flags
indicating corruption and pursue misprocuremerit and other remedies when appropriate. I t
w i l l agree with the Government that the Government w i l l take firm action against officials
who should be held accountable and w i l l build greater awareness o f the consequences o f
corruption among government staff. The Bank w i l l enhance the follow-up on audit
objections, including remedies in the case o f material, systemic issues.
Enhanced information disclosure. The Bank w i l l agree with the Government to the release
o f certain documents that w i l l help enhance the transparency and accountability o f Bankfinanced projects. These would include aide-memoire o f implementation review missions,

46

audit reports and the Government’s formal responses to these reports, procurement plans and
schedules, bidding documents and requests for proposals, shortlists o f consultants, and
summaries o f bid evaluations that do not reveal confidential commercial information
provided by bidders. The Bank w i l l work with civil society to help monitor project
implementation.
162. Managing a risk mitigation program o f this intensity w i l l require that the Bank organizes
itself better to do so. The operations adviser in Dhaka w i l l be empowered to guide the entire process
on behalf o f the country management team. A cross-sectoral Operations Risk Mitigation team has
been established, to be chaired by the operations adviser, with a mandate to implement the
Operational Risk Mitigation Plan and advise task teams in the design and preparation o f projects,
share and disseminate information on risks, advise the country management team on strategy for
mitigating governance risks, and interface with the Department o f Institutional Integrity on
complaints received about corruption in Bank-fmanced operations.

F. PARTNERSHIPS,An, COORDINATION, AND HARMONIZATION

163. To maximize the effectiveness o f i t s programs, the Bank Group i s developing a strong
partnership with key development partners in Bangladesh. As a first step the Bank Group prepared
this CAS jointly with the Asian Development

The objectives in having a joint CAS
include ensuring better coordination and greater
complementarity across the project pipelines o f I
the four donors, giving consistent messages to the Government, and reinforcing one another’s efforts
in supporting specific sector reforms. The joint CAS i s thus expected to also facilitate the
development o f sectorwide approaches beyond those in health and education, for example, in one or
more infrastructure sectors.

I

165.
The joint CAS implies a common assessment o f the PRSP, agreement on a common set o f
broad outcomes, and a common understanding o f the strategies needed to deliver these outcomes.
The joint work has led to broad agreement on areas o f relative emphasis for both analytical work and

Thirty-two countries, bilateral agencies, and multilateral organizations are members o f the Local Consultative Group. Inaddition, there
are 24 technical subgroups on sectors ranging from agriculture to governance to HNIAIDs. Most subpups serve as a channel for
coordination and dialogue among donors, to forge common understandingsand integration o f policies, approaches, and efforts. The
subgroups are generally chaired by the agency with a primary progratn in the sector.

investments (box 5). Under the joint approach each institution maintains i t s own business plans and
project and AAA pipelines, and each has i t s own documentation, consistent with i t s requirements.
However, a joint results matrix shows outcomes and benchmarks for the CAS period, together with
all the interventions by the four CAS partners supporting a given outcome (see attachment 1).
Implementing a joint approach implies higher transaction costs for all parties, and the need to
achieve the desired complementarity or collective approach may impose additional constraints on the
composition and delivery o f a partner’s program.
166. Partnerships with other donors w i l l continue. The Bank i s involved in sectonvide approaches
in health and education. I t has initiated sector-specific consultations in the context o f the CAS with
the aim o f bringing in the larger donor community, and joint work and cofmancing are expected in
sectors o f mutual interest.
167. In other partnerships the Bank’s program w i l l build on Bangladesh’s strengths o f a vibrant
civil society, strong intellectual and research tradition, and dynamic private sector to maximize
impact. Partnerships with local communities, for example, can help shift the onus o f enforcing
accountability from the Bank to the beneficiaries. They can also strengthen checks and balances and
encourage diffbsion and decentralization o f power and decisionmaking. The Bank w i l l also build
strong partnerships with civil society, academic institutions, and the private sector, inviting them, as
appropriate, to contribute to and participate in project design, implementation, and monitoring as
well as the Bank’s analytical work and consensus building on policy reforms.
168. All four CAS partners are committed to supporting harmonization around government
systems in their interventions to the extent possible. Through the Local Consultative Group, donors
are working on a Harmonization Action Plan, which follows on the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness, where governments and development institutions committed to far-reaching and
monitorable actions to increase aid effectiveness.
169. An important first step in the Bangladesh Harmonization Action Plan took place recently, as
the Government took the lead in coordinating the annual donor forum. The Poverty Reduction
Strategy Implementation Forum in November 2005, chaired by the Government, i s now part o f an
annual high-level process to monitor implementation o f the PRSP. At the forum the Government
announced i t s intention to also chair sector-level aid coordination working groups involving Local
Consultative Group donors and to chair a midterm review o f progress on implementation with such
donors. The World Bank w i l l support the transition to a Government-led aid coordination process
consistent with the Paris Harmonization principles, as well as implementation o f the Government’s
Harmonization Action Plan. Actions to do so w i l l include strengthening the Government’s leadership
o f the aid coordination process; ensuring that harmonization principles and Government leadership
are incorporated into key activities supported by the Bank and development partners, such as
sectonvide approaches and joint M,and participating in the Government-led donor working
groups to track implementation o f the PRSP.

V.

R I S K S AND MITIGATION

1. R i s k s Facing Implementation of the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
170.
The last CAS, completed on the eve o f the 2001 elections, identified three potential risks to
the Government’s development goals: the election could result in a weak coalition or in a new
government unwilling to reform, there could be macroeconomic slippages, and the country’s
vulnerability to natural disasters could divert attention and resources from development. None o f
these risks materialized in any significant way. Elections produced a Iandslide victory for the BNP
and i t s allies, which initiated a number o f reforms. Macroeconomic risks were managed well, and
Bangladesh continued to en. oy economic growth and macroeconomic stability despite intense

48

confrontational politics and violent incidents. And as demonstrated in the serious floods o f 2004, the
country’s ability to manage disasters has greatly improved, reducing loss o f l i f e and economic
disruption. All this suggests that Bangladesh’s resilience to political and economic shocks should not
be underestimated. Even so, a look ahead to the remaining years o f the decade reveals severe risks
that w i l l require managing.
171. The political risks appear the most severe, with inevitable consequences for the
economy. The past two years have seen a significant worsening inthe political climate and a marked
deterioration in law and order. Increased political violence, including political assassinations, has
further intensified the confrontational politics and fed the deepening distrust between the two major
political parties. With elections approaching, in January 2007, there i s a distinct risk that violence
may increase and that the key institutions charged by the Constitution with ensuring fair and peaceful
elections-the Election Commission and the neutral caretaker government, which will assume power
three months before elections-will come under severe pressure in Bangladesh’s confi-ontational
political environment. An election result not accepted by one political party or the other could lead to
a prolonged political crisis, distracting attention from Bangladesh’s poverty reduction agenda. Thus
less than a year into this CAS, a deepening political crisis may greatly hamper i t s implementation.
There i s little that the World Bank can do to mitigate such a political risk. The World Bank’s
bilateral CAS partners are actively engaged in a dialogue with the Government and opposition
parties aimed at mitigating this risk. The World Bank itself will, together with i t s partners, try to
engage Bangladesh’s political elite and civil society with a view to developing a consensus on the
development agenda across the political divide and enhancing awareness o f the serious economic
costs o f confrontational politics. The World Bank w i l l also monitor the situation and use the midterm
review o f the CAS to adjust the assistance strategy as appropriate.
172. A related risk i s that in a period o f intense political activity there will be little political
appetite to address the r e f o m in governance that are central to successful implementation o f the

Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Vested interests may also continue to hamper attempts to
implement reforms. The World Bank will work with i t s partners to engage key reformers in a close
dialogue to try to mitigate t h i s risk. If these expectations materialize, the World Bank w i l l focus i t s
energies on progress in one or two key areas where reforms appear both feasible and highly
beneficial. I t w i l l also support donor-led efforts to strengthen the demand for reforms from civil
society and the private sector.
173. Another related risk i s weak implementation capacity. Even if the political w i l l for reform
exists, the steady deterioration in the quality o f the civil service and weak incentives due to low
public sector salaries and poor management o f the civil service could contribute to slow progress in
implementing the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The World Bank w i l l attempt to
mitigate this risk through strategic interventions in support o f improved capacity building in key
areas and support for a merit-based promotion and recruitment system, including a senior service
pool providing strong leadership to the civil service.
174. R i s k s to the growth assumptions underlying the CAS come from the increased competition
that Bangladesh’s garment and textile exporters are facing following the end of the MultiJbre
Arrangement after January 1, 2005. While there has been no serious disruption o f exports in the

initial year since the MFA ended, the World Bank will, as described above, support efforts to reform
the tax administration and regulatory environment and improve infrastructure provision with a view
to reducing the high cost o f doing business in Bangladesh. These efforts w i l l help restore
competitiveness, remove impediments to foreign and domestic investment, and thus facilitate greater
diversification o f the sources o f growth. The World Bank Group w i l l also provide policy advice and
dialogue on competitiveness issues relating to the garment and textile sector in the post-MFA era. In
addition, SEDF will continue to help the ready-made garment industry adjust to the changing market
that i t i s facing.

49

175. Finally, Bangladesh’s economy remains highly vulnerable to the risk o f natural disasters.
The World Bank w i l l continue to support the improvements Bangladesh has made in disaster
mitigation, which have greatly reduced the size o f the shocks imposed by natural disasters on the
economy. Working with its partners, the World Bank w i l l support efforts to mainstream disaster
management in relevant government institutions.

2. R i s k s Facing Implementationof the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
176.
Pervasive corruption in Bangladesh exposes the World Bank’s portfolio to high risk. Failure
to address this risk carries high development effectiveness, fiduciary, and reputational risks for the
Bank. As noted, the World Bank w i l l mitigate t h i s risk by working with the Government to
strengthen i t s fiduciary controls and engaging with the Government in efforts to prevent reversal o f
i t s recent reforms in procurement policy. Recognizing that progress in t h i s area may take time,
however, the World Bank also w i l l take measures to strengthen i t s own fiduciary controls in
operations that it finances (see section IV.E). While these measures are unlikely to eliminate the risks
o f corruption in Bank-financed operations, they should, if properly implemented, significantly
reduce those risks over time. They w i l l also greatly mitigate the associated reputational risks as the
Bank is increasingly seen to be moving decisively to curb corruption in i t s operations.

177. The upcoming elections may slow the FY07 lending portfolio, now planned to proceed at a
regular pace because o f Bangladesh’s development needs, as a result o f a period o f potential
inactivity associated with the caretaker government and the subsequent formation o f a new
government. To mitigate this risk, the FY07 portfolio i s planned to include projects that are at an
advanced stage o f preparation and would likely be processed before the caretaker government takes
power.

Progress toward Achieving the Millennium Development Goals
1.
A mixed picture emerges for Bangladesh fi-om two recent MDG studies, conducted by the
World Bank and the UN/GoB. O n the one hand, there has been remarkable progress on several
MDGs, such as gender parity, consumption poverty and child morality. There are also several
MDGs within reach, but that will require special attention and concerted effort. Finally, there are
a group o f MDGs that will challenge the country for some time.

2.
Bangladesh has already attained (or nearly so) the goal relating to elimination o f gender
disparity in schooling opportunities. Bangladesh i s the only country in South Asia other than S r i
Lanka to have achieved parity in male and female enrollments not just at the primary level but
also at the secondary level. T h i s i s an impressive achievement for a country that i s one o f the
poorest countries in the world, with a per capita gross national income o f only US$1,770 (in PPP
terms) in 2002.

3.
The analysis in the report further suggests that attainment o f two other MDGs - in
particular, the reduction o f consumption-poverty and under-five mortality - i s also feasible with
a combination o f interventions, including sector-specific interventions (such as expanding
immunization coverage and reducing pupil-teacher ratios), economic growth, improved coverage
o f infrastsucture, and social safety-net programs (such as the Education Stipends Program and
the Vulnerable Group Development programs).
4.
However, i t will be challenging for Bangladesh to attain the child malnutrition-related
MDG as well as the education MDGs relating to universal net primary enrollment and primary
completion. In the case o f child malnutrition, the projections suggest that Bangladesh could
come very close to - witlxn 5 percentage points o f - the MD goal o f having no more than 34% o f
i t s children underweight. However, it will be very challenging for the country to attain rates o f
net primary enrollment and primary completion exceeding 8346% by 2015. T h i s assessment i s
based on household survey data. Other studies (UN/GOB) using administrative data show that
primary net enrolment target will be met.

5.
According to the UN/GoB MDG assessment, another goal that will be difficult to achieve
is that related to improving maternal health, indicators o f which, such as the maternal mortality
ratio, remain among the worst in the world. The MMR, for example, falls in the range o f 320 to
400 in 2001. In order for Bangladesh to meet the target for maternal mortality, this figure must
be reduced to 143 per thousand live births, which will require the inducement o f major
behavioral changes in mothers, far greater access to quality reproductive health services, and a
generally improved socio-economic situation.
6.
With respect to water, the UN/GoB assessment observes that arsenic contamination has
reduced the percentage o f people with access to safe water from nearly 100 percent down to
roughly 80 percent in urban areas and 70 percent in rural areas. This presents a major challenge
to improve outcomes by changing ingrained behaviors leading to the use o f contaminated water
from ground tube wells and/or by providing safer technologies to affected villages. In the case
o f sanitation, an emerging set o f challenges to MDG attainment i s driven partly by urbanization,
69

as only 14 percent o f slum dwellers in metropolitan areas have access to sealed latrines. Given
that the urban population i s projected to nearly double to 50 million people by 2015, adequate
provision o f water and sanitation to urban dwellers will be crucial for reaching these MDGs.

7.
Being located on a flood plain with very limited natural resources, Bangladesh
experiences acutely the effects o f environmental degradation. Detrimental environmental
conditions are also exacerbated by poverty, with many millions o f poor people turning to the
extremely limited forest products (Bangladesh has one o f the lowest amount o f forest cover per
capita o f any nation) for their bio-fuel and energy needs. Reversing the trend o f deforestation
and increasing energy efficiency, therefore, weigh heavily o n the MDG agenda o f ensuring
environmental sustainability. The financial and institutional resources necessary to accomplish
these objectives, however, pose significant challenges to attainment o f this MDG.
8.
What accounts for the extraordinary progress in improving social indicators in
Bangladesh? Some have commented that Bangladesh’s better performance may have to do with
the fact that public expenditure on health as a proportion o f GDP i s almost twice as high in
Bangladesh (1.5%) as in, say, India (0.9%). T h i s was not always so. In 1990, Bangladesh spent
only 0.7% o f i t s GDP on health - less than what India spent (0.9%) (UNDP 2004). Thus,
Bangladesh saw public spending on health increase very sharply during the 1990s, whde India
experienced stagnation in public spending o n health (in relation to GDP growth).
I t is instructive to look at public educational expenditures in Bangladesh and India as
9.
well. In 1999-2001, India’s public spending on education was 4.1 % o f i t s GDP - considerably
greater than public spending on education in Bangladesh, which was only 2.3% o f GDP (UNDP
2004). However, as in the case o f health, public expenditure on education in Bangladesh
increased from 1.5% o f GDP in 1990 to 2.3% o f GDP in 1999-2001 - an increase o f more than
50%. In contrast, public spending o n education as a share o f GDP increased by merely 5% over
the same period in India - fi-om 3.9% to 4.1% o f GDP. Additionally, there i s an important
difference between Bangladesh and India in the composition o f public spending o n education.
While Bangladesh spends 45.1 % o f its total public expenditure o n education at the pre-primary
and primary level, the relevant figure for India i s 38.4%. At the other extreme, India spends
20.3% o f i t s total public spending o n education at the tertiary level, in contrast to Bangladesh’s
11.1% (UNDP 2004). Thus, the rapid growth o f public spending o n education and health in
Bangladesh, combined with i t s better balance o f educational spending across the primary and
tertiary sectors (relative to India), are likely to be important factors in explaining the significant
progress the country has made in i t s social indicators during the 1990s.

Another factor that i s likely to be important in explaining Bangladesh’s relative success
in attaining positive social outcomes i s the work o f i t s NGOs. Bangladesh may well be the
world’s leader in using NGOs as vehicles o f development. NGOs are involved in virtually every
activity in the country - relief and rehabilitation, poverty alleviation, health, education, social
protection, and environmental protection, to name a few. A villager in Bangladesh can send h s
or her c h l d to an N G O school, have family planning and basic health services delivered by an

10.

NGO health worker, obtain micro-credit financing fi-om a choice o f several NGO banks, sell
milk and other dairy products to an NGO dairy cooperative, and make a telephone call on an
NGO telephone. Secondary education in Bangladesh i s almost entirely provided by the non70

government sector - viz., the NGOs, for-profit schools, and religious schools (madrasas).
Likewise, many o f the family planning programs o f the 1970s and 1980s, wluch set the stage for
the subsequent decline in child mortality, were primarily delivered through NGOs. And several
studies suggest that micro-credit programs, wluch were pioneered by one o f the best-known
NGOs in the world-the Grameen Bank-have had a significant effect on reducing poverty,
especially among females.

11.
Yet another factor in explaining Bangladesh’s success, especially i t s ability to eliminate
gender disparity in enrollment even at the secondary level, i s the use o f targeted public
interventions, such as the Female Secondary School Stipend Program (FSSS). The FSSS
program i s essentially a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) or a demand-side intervention for rural
girls (the majority o f whom are poor) to attend secondary school. By all indications, the FSSS
program has been hugely successful in increasing female secondary school enrollments,
especially since secondary schooling in Bangladesh i s not free and parents are often unwilling to
invest in the secondary schooling o f their daughters.
12.
However, Bangladesh’s progress o n the MD indicators during the 1990s does not mean
that there are no problems going forward. Indeed, there are several areas o f remaining concern.
First, there are very large regional disparities in virtually all o f the MD indicators in Bangladesh.
Districts such as Noakhali, Pathuakali, Chittagong, Rajshahi, and Sylhet have generally not
performed well on several o f the MD indicators. Even if Bangladesh as a whole attains some o f
the MDGs, there will be several areas o f the country that will remain distantly behind. The
analysis in the World Bank report suggests that poor performances on many o f the MD
indicators are geographically concentrated in a few regions. %s in turn means that targeting
interventions, central government resources, and economic growth opportunities to the lagging
divisions and districts will speed up attainment o f the MDGs.
13.
Second, the problem o f governance - in particular, poor service delivery - i s widespread
in the social sectors in Bangladesh. Doctors, health workers and teachers are typically absent
from their assigned posts at government health centers and schools. Membership o f school
management committees i s highly politicized, and teacher recruitment i s often subject to
personal influence. Procurement o f textbooks and essential drugs i s rife with corruption. The
quality o f health and education services offered at most government health facilities i s generally
very poor, Yet the evidence presented in this report indicates the tremendous importance o f
service delivery in influencing MD outcomes. Infant and under-five mortality rates have fallen
most in areas where effective family planning and M C W F P programs are delivered to rural
women with l o w schooling; female school enrollments have increased thanks to a well-designed
and well-delivered secondary stipend program that reaches i t s intended beneficiaries; and public
transfer programs that deliver food supplies to the vulnerable in m a l areas, such as Food-forWork, Vulnerable Group Feeding and Vulnerable Group Development, are associated with large
reductions in child malnutrition among the poorest children. This suggests that better
governance, and improved delivery o f social services in particular, would be very important to
attaining the MDGs.
14.
Better delivery o f public services - whether in health, schooling, nutrition, or
infrastructure - is a complex and difficult task that entails creation o f the right institutions and
71

incentives, including devolving responsibility for service delivery to local governments and
communities, contracting out certain types o f service delivery to the non-government sector,
empowering consumers to demand better services &om government health facilities, introducing
competition among public providers, and ensuring the motivation o f front-line workers (World
Bank 2003).
15.
There are some other findings fkom the World Bank report that are useful to reiterate. The
report notes there is evidence o f significant synergies among the different MDGs. For instance, a
reduction in the proportion o f underweight children i s strongly associated with a reduction o f
child mortality. Although maternal mortality is an MD indicator that has not been analyzed in
t h s report, it i s clear that interventions that reduce maternal mortality, such as tetanus
immunization, expansion o f antenatal care coverage, and an increase in the ratio o f
professionally-attended deliveries, will also bring about large reductions in infant (especially
neonatal) mortality. Likewise, reducing child malnutrition i s likely to result in both schooling
quantity and quality, as better nourished children are more likely to attend school and perform
better in school. Thus there are synergies amongst the MDGs that will help in their attainment,
which implies that proceeding with simultaneous action on all these measures will have the
greatest impact on attainment o f the MDGs.
16.
The simulations carried out in the World Bank’s MDG assessment also suggest that
economic growth that brings about an improvement in household living standards i s strongly
associated with virtually every MD indicator. For example, real per capita GDP growth o f 4%
per annum in Bangladesh could alone bring down the under-five mortality rate by about 8 deaths
per 1,000 live births and the incidence o f poverty by 21 percentage points between now and
2015. In addition, t h i s growth could bring about an increase in the net primary enrollment rate o f
5 percentage points by 2015. In other words, rapid economic growth could make significant
contributions to an improvement in all the MD indicators between now and 2015.

period, the highest 5-year average since independence. Growth has been underpinnedby a resurgence of
private investment; which grew at an annual average rate o f lo%, increasing i t s share in GDP from 16%
in FYOl to 18.5% in FY05. The share o f public investment inthe meanwhile fell from 7% to 6%. While
benefiting from continued strong export growth (about 8% p.a.), with garment exports being the mainstay,
growth has also been fairly broad-based. Construction and services sectors in particular have grown
strongly fueled by large remittance inflows. Agriculture sector growth has been rather anemic, averaging
just 2% over the period.
2. Containment of the fiscal deficit at around 3.5% of GDP, partly through curbs on w a s t e l l
expenditures, has improved the prospects for fiscal sustainability. Fiscal deficit has been lowered from
around 6% in FYOO to 3.5% in FY05 and i t s financing patterns made more prudent, with increased
emphasis on concessional external fmancing. Benefiting from good growth and fiscal prudence, public
sector debt has been contained at under 50% o f GDP and appears on a sustainable path although there are
potential risks. A particular concern i s the growing liabilities o f the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation
(BPC) due to the recent increases in global oil prices that have not been fully passed-through to
consumers; resulting BPC losses equaled 0.7% o f GDP inFY05.

3. Monetary policy has broadly supported growth while doing a good job of containing inflation.
Inflation remained below 5% over the FYO1-03 period, rising to 6% in FY04 and further to 6.5% in
FY05. Bangladesh Bank was slow to respond to the exogenous pressures on inflation arising from global
commodity price increases and the 2004 floods, but has tightened monetary policy considerably since
March 2005.
4. The external sector has benefited from strong growth in exports and remittances, which supported
equally robust growth of imports, including of capitalgoods. Exports increased by 40% and remittances
doubled over the FY00-05 period while imports increased by 50%. The current account recorded s m a l l
surpluses in fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004 before slipping into a deficit equaling 0.9% o f GDP in
FY05. Sharply rising cost o f o i l and other commodity imports contributed to the current account deficit
in the latest year. Benefiting also from a pick-up in concessional and other long-term capital inflows,

foreign exchange reserves increased from their precarious level o f US$ 1 billion (or 1 month o f import
cover) in end-2001 to a more comfortable U S $ 3 billion by end-FYO5.

5. Authoritiesfloated the exchange rate in May 2003. The exchange rate has been relatively stable
since, with taka losing about 15% o f i t s value against the dollar, although exceptionally strong import
growth has put it under some stress since the beginning o f 2005. Import growth has been fueled by a
sharp rise in oil imports (oil imports exceeded forecast levels by about US$500 million in FY05),
increases in demand for intermediate goods and capital machinery due to increased domestic activity, and
higher rice and wheat imports to cover shortages caused by floods. Early on in 2005, Bangladesh Bank
used i t s reserves to support the taka almost to the limit specified in the macroframework agreed with the
IMF, but has subsequently allowed the taka to depreciate and tightened monetary conditions to stem
further pressures.
6. Although external debt is relatively low - at about 33% o f GDP and that too mostly on concessional
terms - because of modest export levels (14% of GDP in FY05), the country faces some medium-term
liquidity risks: the ratio o f net present value o f future debt servicing obligations to goods and non-factor
services exports stands at about 150%. A good record on macro stability has led to renewed interest by
foreign investors. Bangladesh i s close to completing an agreement with the Tata Group o f India which

73

would bring in FDI worth US$2.5 billion in production plants for energy, steel, coal, and fertilizers. If it
does goes through, it would be the single largest foreign investment deal for Bangladesh. Further, the
Abu Dhabi Group recently announced a decision to invest U S $ I billion in telecommunications,
pharmaceuticals, and hotels.

.Macroeconomic Prospects over the Next CAS

7. The Government’s medium-term macroeconomic framework commits to fiscal and monetary
prudence and deepening structural reforms. The framework envisages acceleration in GDP growth
from 5.4% in FY05 to 6.0% in FY06 and 6.5% in FY08. Such faster growth would require a significantly
higher level o f investment and more efficient investment decisions than in the past. Achievement o f
these, inturn, assumes acceleration in the pace o f structural reforms to tackle supply-side bottlenecks. As
suggested by a recent World Bank report,’ growth rates o f around 7% would be feasible if the
Government scales up i t s efforts to improve economic governance and reduce regulatory costs, address
infrastructure constraints (especially ports and power), deepen and improve the efficiency o f the financial
sector, improve labor quality, and further lower trade barriers. Investment rates would need to rise
substantially to a level unlikely to be covered by higher private savings alone: this w i l l require fiscal
prudence (cutting budget deficits, lowering SOE losses etc.), continued donor support, and significant
increases in foreign capital inflows.

8. The Government’s fiscal policy aims to finance social development and key public investment
while containing the deficit and maintaining debt sustainability. The level o f public expendituxe, at
nearly 14% o f GDP, i s low by global standards, reflecting weak revenues and low implementation
capacity. Total tax and revenue collection rates remain among the lowest in the world at 8 and 10% o f
GDP. The medium-term framework envisions improvements inthese. Revenue to GDP ratio i s projected
to increase to 12% by FY09 as a result o f modernization o f the National Board o f Revenue, and the

expenditure to GDP ratio to 15.5%. Fiscal deficits would be contained at or under 4% o f GDP and
domestic financing o f these would be limited to under 2% o f GDP, to ensure continued fiscal
sustainability. Fiscal sustainability w i l l further depend on the Government’s ability to contain the
emerging contingent liabilities being generated as a result o f the growing losses o f the BPC. Pass-through
o f international price increases to domestic consumers would be important to contain that risk. Continued
monetary prudence would be necessary to contain inflation at the targeted rates o f 7% in FY06 which
would be lowered down to under 5% by FYO8, especially inthe face o f rising commodity prices.

9. Export pegormance faces considerable risks and some opportunitiesfrom the dismantling of the
Agreement on Textiles & Clothing (ATC) from January 2005, which exposes Bangladesh to

competition from garment exporters previously restricted by quotas. This poses a considerable challenge
for the economy, because the garment sector accounts for over three-quarter o f total exports, and directly
employs about 2 million workers, o f whom 90% are women. Woven garment exports seem to have
already been adversely affected by the removal o f the quota system, recording -4% growth over the
January-June period: knitwear exports grew at 26% over the same period, keeping overall garment export
growth at 7%. I t may s t i l l be too early to assess the long-run impact o f the quota removals. A hopeful
sign i s that new investment and market orders continue to flow. Also, Bangladesh i s competitive in the
high-volume, low-margin segment o f the world market and retains preferential access to the EU and
Canadian markets due to i t s L D C status. At the same time, the post ATC world offers some opportunities
for Bangladesh, as exemplified in the more-than-doubling o f knitwear exports to the U S over the JanuaryJune 2005 period; knitwear exports to the U S were previously constrained by quotas. The invoking o f
WTO safeguards on China by the EU and the U S should also benefit Bangladesh over the next two years.

Summary of CAS Consultations
1.
The Country Assistance Strategy o f Bangladesh that i s being presented to the board has benefited
from extensive consultations with various segments o f the Bangladeshi society. These consultations have
taken place in three stages beginning in early 2004 and the latest taking place in October 2005, in
partnership with the four joint strategy partners ADB, DFID and Japan. The objectives o f t h i s extensive
solicit views o f the Bangladeshis on issues and development challenges facing them
process were to: (i)
in their daily lives, before the conceptualization o f the CAS; and (ii)
receive feedback on the strategy,
priorities and development programs that the WB and development partners aimed to support.
First Stage of Consultations
2.
The first stage that took place in February 2004, included ten rounds o f consultations with
various stakeholder groups, with three o f these consultations organized in two divisional towns, Rajshahi
and Khulna and the others in the capital, Dhaka. Cross-sectional, mixed and theme-based stakeholder
groups were invited for these three-to-four hour consultations. In December 2004, a consultation meeting
with indigenous people’s representatives was organized jointly with the Asian Development Bank at
Rangamati (Chittagong Hill Tracts) (Box 1).
Box 1: Regional consultations
The first CAS consultations, held at Rajshahi on February 14, 2004 included a mixed group o f 42 participants
comprising academics and researchers, local leaders, private sector representatives, activists and staff from
NGOs and organizations worlung on human rights and gender issues. This was followed by a discussion with 24
rural participants in a village in Charghat upazilla o f Rajshahi. Then four meetings were organized in Dhaka
with various stakeholder groups -- NGO representatives, urban poor, academia and think-tanks, and the private
sector representatives. The next public consultation for the CAS was held in Khulna on March 18 with a mixed
group drawn from cross-sections o f this city. Another consultation with the small-medium enterprises (SME)
and business community was organized jointly with the Small Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) and I F C
in Dhaka. After a gap o f five months, the next series of consultations was held in August with four meetings in
Dhaka with different thematic groups - &sadvantaged youth, retrenched garments workers, representatives from
organizations for disabled persons, and university students.

3.
Given the initial goal o f the CAS team to listen to the various viewpoints in the society, the
process was designed to be simple, participatory, and interactive. After the initial welcome and
introductions, the Bank team provided a brief presentation on the background and the CAS process; the
participants were then asked to reflect on the successes and achievements o f Bangladesh followed by their
views on i t s problems and failures. The discussion then focused on ‘what’ could be done and ‘how’ to
address these issues in the context o f growth and development and the role o f the World Bank as a
development partner.
4.
Within the wide spectrum o f views expressed at the consultations, the achievements and
successes o f the country were overshadowed by the participants’ negative perceptions on the current state
o f affairs in Bangladesh. These included the deteriorating law and order situation, poor governance,
increase in corruption and politicization at all levels o f the executive and judiciary, the prevalence o f
confrontational political culture, and lack o f access to basic services (such as timely and adequate
healthcare, quality education, arsenic-free safe drinking water, and proper sanitation facilities). Problems
mentioned during most consultations also covered the want o f income-generating activities and
employment opportunities, lack o f investment opportunities and lack o f security for
investmentslinvestors, and bottlenecks in infrastructure (transportation, ports, power, and information
technology) as well as the adverse effects o f inadequate policy directions and absence o f timely decisions
national issues (such on the issues o f gas exports, ports, finance and stock markets).

83

5.
Given the post-conflict situation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the Rangamati consultations,
local participants underscored the need for implementing the 1997 Peace Accord fully, with the
streamlining o f various legal problems and ensuring that all development activities in the region take into
account the preferences o f the indigenous peoples.

4.
Among achievements and successes o f Bangladesh, participants mentioned the increase o f
enrolment inprimary and girls’ education, more awareness on health, immunization and family planning,
significant development in transports and communication, role o f NGOs (such as schooling for urban
s l u m dwellers), more press freedom, increased coverage o f sanitation and water supply, and micro-credit
helping income generation.
7.
The recommendations fiom these consultations were generally aimed at changing the existing
scenario o f more negative aspects, where the Bank was to be a facilitator rather than providing
prescriptions and could contribute much more to the development process. The areas for which
facilitating the improvement o f Government-NGO relations, (ii)
suggestions were made included: (i)
helping decentralization in different spheres, (iii)
exploring the export markets for Bangladeshi products
in a post-MFA world, and (iv) emphasis on gender and social protection issues. Also, most participants
indicated the important role o f the Bank in human resource development and capacity building,
improvement o f infrastructure, exploration and utilization o f natural resources, and promotion o f reforms
and improved governance in the country.

8.
In addition, a couple o f CAS-related brainstorning sessions were also organized for the Bank’s
Dhaka office staff. On the other side, the CAS team maintained regular liaison with the Government’s
team which was then inthe initial stages o f preparing the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
As the CAS would cover the same period as the PRSP, it was envisaged that the main thrust o f both these
documents will be synchronized -- both the CAS and the PRSP aim to address the same basic problems
and build on the common goal o f sustainable improvement inprosperity for the majority o f Bangladeshis.
Second Stage of Consultations
9.
The second stage took place in July 2005 after the Bank and the development partners were at a
more advanced stage o f their preparations. T h i s stage included consultations on the joint strategy o f the
four CAS partners (in addition to the Bank’s specific) and evolved around the joint outcome matrix that
summarized, country’s development goals, issues and challenges to achieve them, outcomes that the
development partners can influence and their programs o f support. This stage o f consultations included
both small focus discussion groups as well as broader audiences, such as a fonun o f Government
Secretaries, private sector representatives, NGOs and civil society, academics and think-tanks, the media,
and the broader donor community represented by the Local Consultative Group (LCG) o f donors,

10.
At these consultations, the Joint Strategy was introduced by the head o f one o f the agencies as
being prepared to have a common approach that would reduce the transactions cost and increase
coherence o f engagement. After the presentation on the Strategy, which was aligned with the longer-term
development agenda as outlined in the draft PRSP, participants were invited to provide their comments on
the Joint Results Framework (Outcome Matrix) and responses were provided by the representatives o f the
four partner agencies.

11.
Participants endorsed the strategy and the priority areas identified for support by the Bank and
other development partners in connection with the PRSP.
Governance and related reforms were
consistently highlighted as an area o f major concern with participants suggesting the need for a concrete
program to address governance issues. Tackling corruption i s an important issue but concrete ideas which
go beyond stating ‘government failure’ are needed. It was suggested that the joint strategy could focus
more on the developments in the political system, which are important for accelerating the country’s

84

economic development. A related question was how the strategy could help in improving the negative
perception o f Bangladesh to outsiders.

12.
Decentralization was repeatedly stressed upon as the way to address development issues in
Bangladesh, with a consensus on the need for an increased role o f local governments. The development
partners were asked to “speak out in one voice’ to push decentralization.
13.
On issues o f economy and poverty alleviation, participants mentioned that ‘pro-poor growth’ was
not adequately defined and questions were raised as to how the strategy intended to achieve it. I t was also
pointed that there was insufficient mention o f how the strategy would support the achievement o f MDG
targets.

14.
There were queries as to how the CAS proposed to ensure ‘voice to the people’ and to ensure
‘round-the-year employment’ for the poor, and how it aimed to reach the hardcore poor and ensure that
development extends to the remote and vulnerable areas.
15.
Participants suggested the identification o f an agricultural policy that looked into the issues o f
small farmers and wage labor. Rather than simple rural development, rural planning and management
need to be emphasized. Simultaneously, the issue o f rapid urbanization and related urban poverty should
be highlighted in the CAS.
16.
On human development issues, population growth and adolescent healthcare were emphasized.
Arresting the deteriorating quality o f education as well as the accountability o f teachers was required
along with ‘non-partisan’ educational management. Some suggested that the CAS should stress upon
human security and speak out strongly against human rights infringements inBangladesh.
17.
Private sector representatives mentioned that the cost o f doing business in Bangladesh was
becoming high, and the private sector cannot access resources at market cost while there i s not much PPP
on the ground. The role o f private sector and i t s development in the then draft PRSP was not adequately
highlighted. The PSD problems highlighted in the coiisultations include bottlenecks in infrastructure,
high-cost economy, access to finance and credit, and the criminalization o f the economy. The need for
decentralized growth centers and to have the rural economy grow there by fostering private sector and
SMEs was underscored.

18.
The team plans to follow up on these consultations on a regular basis during the implementation
o f the program. I t also plans to undertake a mid-term review to assess progress towards the outcomes
identified in the results matrix.

This report presents an assessment’ o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bangladesh,
defined in the FYOl CAS document and adjusted in the FY03 CAS Progress Report to respond to the
country’s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).2 To identify the lessons - presented in

Overview

2.
Building on i t s remarkable achievements, Bangladesh continued to make good social and
economic progress during the CAS period despite governance and other structural constraints. T h i s
progress indicates the country’s potential but also the need to remove these obstacles to achieve even
better development results. As the report shows, while the CAS was relevant to this challenge, the overall
impact o f Bank assistance was modest. By responding in a timely fashion to the reform commitment
demonstrated by the new government that took office in October 2002, the Bank played a catalytic role in
the definition o f the reform agenda and completion o f Bangladesh’s I-PRSP. In line with the previous
Bank strategy, the CAS put governance improvement and institutional development at the center o f Bank
assistance. Translating t h i s broad goal into measurable results proved difficult, except in a few relevant
areas such as public procurement and financial management. In the meantime, governance issues,
particularly corruption and law and order, continued to hinder CAS implementation and achievement o f
outcomes.
3.
In general, the Bank could not contribute to the country’s progress at the levels initially
envisioned in the CAS. Bangladesh was not able to access all o f i t s IDA allocation as it faced difficulty
in meeting the CAS triggers for base-case lending levels, which were directly linked to implementation o f
In addition to country team inputs, the assessment i s based on Bank data and reports related to the country program’s quality,
responsiveness, and effectiveness. These include the 2004 Country Program Assessment by QAG; the 2004 Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) conductedjointly by the Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan Bank for

International Cooperation (JBIC); project documents and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs); and assessments by
OED and QAG.
The last CAS was discussed by the Board on December 12,2000, and the CAS Progress Report on June 19,2003, along with
the Joint Staff Assessment o f the I-PRSP.

86

comprehensive policy and sector reforms. The CAS requirement - reflecting the dominant perception o f
Bangladesh as a “poor reformer” - o f upfront reforms before providing assistance to critical sectors such
as power, banking, and water, restricted Bank engagement, while making policy dialogue and country
program development, as well as contribution to some o f the CAS outcomes, an increasing challenge.
Consequently, most o f FYO1-03 IDA lending was made in the last quarter o f FY03. This pattern was also
repeated in FY04, when most lending was approved in June, and several key operations actually slipped
to the first quarter o f FY05.3

4.
Simultaneously, delivery o f Bank assistance was hindered by poor portfolio performance, Project
implementation and disbursements slowed down, and in FY04, the latter f e l l to very low levels. This
situation was reflected in the deterioration o f the Bangladesh portfolio, which culminated in FY03 with
one o f the worse performances o f recent years.
5.
The above circumstances notwithstanding, the Bank was effective in helping Bangladesh make
&her human development gains, thus contributing positively towards the country’s achievement o f the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Bank assistance also helped maintain good economic growth,
but overall impact was affected by the Bank’s limited support to infrastructure and power development.
Although the Bank contributed successfully to the expansion o f rural infrastructure and microfinance, it
played a smaller role in promoting agricultural growth. Significantly, results from institution building
efforts were s t i l l modest, despite constant attention over several CAS periods.

6.
How to best help Bangladesh address governance constraints remains among the main strategic
issues for Bank Group assistance. To a great extent, the risk-averse behavior o f disengagement from
difficult sectors promoted by the prevailing Bank culture and the negative perception o f the country was
implicit in the CAS design, and became evident during i t s implementation. Moving forward, concrete
approaches that deal with governance at the program and project level, while attempting to support
change from within those sectors with willingness to refonn, could help achieve better outcomes. As the
country’s experience indicates, reforms can be implemented even under difficult political and institutional
circumstances, although often through an incremental, opportunistic and not always predictable path. To
achieve critical mass, however, reforms need to be implemented consistently across key sectors and
political cycles.
7.

Under the above conditions, Bank strategy requires increased flexibility in i t s perfonnance-based
design, not only in i t s lending triggers, but also in i t s strategic approach to sectors critical to accelerating
growth and poverty reduction. T h i s flexibility should also be reflected in the country program through
programmatic, increasingly multi-sectoral budgetary support that allows lending to be attuned to a
changing and difficult-to-predict reform process, while ensuring that progress i s sustained. At the project
level, better attention i s also needed to the political and institutional contexts as well as to cross-sectoral
constraints that have proven critical to project implementation, and by extension, project impact and
sustainability. The focus on results in the new CAS demands, at the same time, improved measurement
and evaluation o f project impact, more strategic design o f analytical and advisory services, and more
realistic definition o f what can be accomplished during the CAS period given country conditions and
Bank Group resource constraints.

A.

CASContext

8.
The context for strategy development in 2000 was Bangladesh’s remarkable social and
human development achievements and i t s many immediate challenges. Throughout the 1990s, in
These operations included two adjustment credits totaling US$300 million.

87

particular, per capita income grew three times faster than the average for low income countries, as real
GDP growth reached about 5 percent per year and the population growth rate was further reduced to 1.5
percent. At the same time, poverty declined after virtual stagnation in the 1980s, as corroborated by a
decrease in the poverty rate from 59 in 1991 to 50 percent o f total population by 2000. Moreover,
Bangladesh continued to achieve comparatively better progress ih social indicators than countries at
similar income levels. On the other hand, poverty numbers remained high, inequality increased, and
economic growth needed to be accelerated for faster poverty reduction. The country’s good growth
performance appeared difficult to sustain, let alone to accelerate, unless the reform agenda was
reenergized and macroeconomic management put back on track. Importantly, progress in some human
development indicators had slowed down; differences in health, nutrition and population indicators
remained large across income groups and between genders; and quality o f education and health services
needed substantial improvement. Environmental management remained weak, and better management o f
the country’s water resources was urgently needed. New challenges emerged, including preventing an
HIV/AIDS epidemic and providing an effective response to arsenic groundwater contamination. That the
impressive gains made by Bangladesh had taken place despite governance and other structural problems
underscored both the country’s potential and some o f i t s major constraints.

9.
Bangladesh made good progress in the past four years, but weak institutions, corruption
and deteriorating law and order hindered achievement of CAS outcomes and development
effectiveness. One o f the main challenges faced by the Bank in Bangladesh has been finding effective
ways to assist a country with substantial development needs, but also with entrenched governance
problems. Opposition to reform by powerful vested interests remained strong during the CAS period, and
progess at the microeconomic and sector levels could not match the success in achieving macro-stability.
Corruption and the law and order situation discouraged local and foreign private investment, while
.~
aid
Bangladesh’s achievements were obscured by the persistent negative image o f the c o ~ n t r yAlthough
flows slightly increased recently, both development assistance and private investment remain
During CAS implementation, aid effectiveness continued to be hindered by the country’s lack o f
institutional capacity, the government’s lack o f ownership o f development program, and the weak
project implementation capacity o f the line agencies.
10.
At the same time, the nature of politics in the country affected both C A S formulation and
implementation. The CAS was prepared more than a year before the 2001 general elections, and the
CAS period ended with a new government in office.6 Confrontational politics continued to impede the
emergence o f a broadly-shared national development strategy, challenging CAS formulation. The absence
o f consensus on key policies also affected the consistent implementation o f development policies and
programs across the political cycles, challenging CAS implementation. Under these circumstances, PRSP
preparation could not advance as expected, and the Bank’s plan o f preparing a new CAS in FY03 did not
materialize. More specifically, the CAS suffered from the intensification o f confrontational politics,
characterized by frequent hartah (strikes) and deterioration in human security. Donor members o f the
Local Consultative Group (LCG), including the Bank, felt compelled in March 1999 to voice their
concerns about the damage being done to the country by confrontational politics, calling on government
and opposition parties to work together for Bangladesh’s future. By 2000, when CAS consultations
began, the political environment had become highly contentious - and Bank-government relations
strained - making i t even more difficult to build across-the-board political consensus on country priorities
In 2003 Bangladeshwas ranked in Transparency International’s Perceptions Index as the country perceived as most corrupt in
the world for the third consecutive year, which helped reinforce this image.
In addition to institutional and political performance, aids flows to Bangladeshhad been declining in the period preceding CAS
preparation because o f lower availability o f donor assistance worldwide. FY99 was an exception to this trend in Bangladesh
due to the additional aid provided by developmentpartners, including the Bank, to help with the 1998 flood emergency.
At the time o f CAS preparation, two elections and three transitions o f government had taken place since the restoration o f
democracy in 1991, with the two main parties alternating in power.

88

and development goals.7 Similar concenis related to intensified political codfontation and violence linked
prematurely to the next electoral cycle prevailed at the end o f the CAS period, as corroborated by LCG
statements during the Development Fonun in May 2004.
11.
When the C A S was prepared, there were two major uncertainties: first, whether a more
reformist stance would emerge after the elections; and second, which opportunities would be
available to the new government to implement reforms. The new government - a four-party coalition
led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) - demonstrated i t s commitment to reforms, although these
could not be advanced at the pace and levels expected in the CAS. Reforms started to gain momentum in
2002, however, and the CAS Progress Report prepared in 2003 reflects a s h i f t in Bank engagement in line
with these new circumstances. Given the difficult country conditions, it i s commendable that the
economy continued to perform relatively well during the CAS period, and that some difficult reforms
were successfully advanced in critical areas such as economic governance, fiscal management, State
Owned Enterprises (SOEs), banking, telecommunications and energy. A stronger effort i s nevertheless
needed to accelerate administrative, legal, and political reforms.

B.

Country Development Results

12.
The country development goals and results underpinning the Bank’s strategy were initially
derived from the Government’s five-year development plan and several subsequent official
documents However, recognizing that the national strategy required more definition and broader
consensus, extensive consultations were carried out during CAS preparation in 2000. In 2003, the Bank’s
strategy was adjusted - through a CAS Progress Report - to respond to the new National Strategy for
Economic Growth, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development, which i s the country’s I-PRSP. The
latter was prepared following nationwide consultations, and represents an initial statement o f the
country’s vision and goals.’

*

13.
Specifically, the C A S aimed at helping Bangladesh achieve i t s overarching goal - confirmed
in the I-PRSP - of reducing poverty substantially within the shortest possible time. Bangladesh has
recognized that faster poverty reduction cannot be accomplished without accelerating and broadening
economic growth. The strategic objectives o f the CAS, discussed in Section C, were thus selected to
support the various areas emphasized in the national plan, and later on in the I-PRSP, to reach an annual
growth rate o f 6 to 7 percent and a poverty reduction rate o f 2 to 3 percent. These areas include giving
the private sector a greater role in the economy; increasing the pace o f agricultural and non-farm rural
growth; emphasizing investments in education, nutrition, health, and water and sanitation; and improving
the targeting o f social expenditures and safety net programs.
14.
While the MDGs were not yet part of the development agenda, many of the country
development results to which the C A S was f i r s t aligned anticipated them, often with more
ambitious targets. As shown in Table A, Bangladesh has focused consistently on social and human
development results. In addition to controlling population growth effectively without resorting to coercive
measures, the country has endeavored to reduce infant mortality, child malnutrition, and maternal
mortality; expand access to education; and increase income-generation opportunities for women. During
Among other issues, the Government had expressed disappointment with the expected level of IDA lending under the low-case
scenario, and the pressure to accelerate governance reforms.
In addition to the Fifth Fiveyear Development Plan (1997-2002), the CAS considered other official documents that further
described the country’s development strategy, including the Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction (PAPR) signed
between the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on April 2000, and the Government’s Memorandum for
the 2000 Bangladesh Development Forum.
The Interim PRSP was completed in March 2003, and its implementation started on July 1,2003 - the beginning of the official
fiscal year in Bangladesh.

the CAS period, despite a global economic slowdown, the country maintained its good economic
performance, and according to the latest projections, i t could achieve 5.5 percent GDP growth in FY04.
Given this performance, it i s likely that the positive trend in poverty reduction achieved in the 1990s
continued into 2004. In some areas such as child malnutrition, maternal mortality, and net primary
enrollment, the country surpassed in 2001 the figures projected in the CAS for 2003. Progress toward the
MDGs was significant, and for most indicators, Bangladesh i s on target or better with regard to achieving
the goals. In fact, Bangladesh has already met the MDG target o f eliminating gender disparity in basic
education while making good progress towards the MDG o f providing universal education.”
15.
As reflected in the CAS Progress Report, the I-PRSP further specifies the country
development results sought by Bangladesh, which have been explicitly linked to the MDGs but
adapted to reflect country-specific aspirations. In the I-PRSP, Bangladesh continued to set challenging
targets for itself, especially since the base year used was 2000 instead o f 1990 - the established
benchmark o f the MDGs - while 2015 was maintained as the end year. To accelerate progress and meet
country targets, the I-PRSP was built upon five pillars, including improving governance, accelerating
broad-based growth, investing in human development, promoting women’s advancement, and ensuring
social protection.

C.

CAS Outcomes

16.
The CAS was built around three strategic objectives relevant to country priorities and
development results. Specifically, the CAS aimed at helping Bangladesh to (i)
accelerate broad-based
growth; (ii)
consolidate human development gains and address emerging challenges including HIVIAIDS
and arsenicosis; and (iii)
implement an integrated approach to rural development. Linking these objectives
was the CAS emphasis on assisting the country in building stronger institutions and improving
governance, and dealing with crosscutting issues such as environmental management and gender. These
objectives were c o n f i i e d in the FY03 CAS Progress Report, adjusted in light o f the renewed attention to
critical areas for growth such as infrastructure, power and ports.

CAS Design and Implementation Issues
17.
The F Y O l CAS made removing governance and other structural constraints affecting
growth and poverty reduction critical to Bank assistance. During CAS consultations in 2000,
stakeholders repeatedly voiced as one o f their major concerns the very high cost imposed on Bangladesh
by poor governance, especially by corruption, deteriorating law and order, and weak institutions.” The
CAS recognized that tackling these issues i s a long-term endeavor that requires fundamental changes in
the terms o f political engagement and the power o f vested interests in the country. The CAS aimed at
creating “a powerful nexus for positive movement toward stronger, accountable institutions, improved
governance and a greater voice for the people.” Translating this broad goal into specific results remains a
challenge.

18.
Adapting to Bangladesh’s political cycle, C A S objectives were pursued through a
performance-based assistance strategy underpinned by a two-phased approach. First, during the preelection period and the settling in o f the new government, non-lending activities were given a prominent
role while lending continued under the low case. Second, once the country met the CAS performance
triggers set for macroeconomic management, governance, reforms in key sectors, and portfolio
performance, lending moved into the base case and was extended beyond projects with direct poverty
sources include World Development Indicators, The World Bank (2004); and Bangladesh’s I-PRSP, Government of
Bangladesh (2003).
Similar concerns were raised during I-PRSP consultations in 2002 and PRSP consultations in 2004.

impact. Simultaneously, IFC took into account the existing regulatory obstacles, uncertain economic
prospects, and weak business environment prevalent in Bangladesh. As such, IFC focused on investment
opportunities with strong, reputable domestic or international sponsors, particularly in manufacturing and
infrastructure.

19.
The general strategic approach produced several positive results. By intensiflmg analytical
work and responding in a timely manner to official requests for advice, the country team engaged the new
government very early on, establishing better Bank-government relations and improving policy dialogue,
except in a few line ministries, most notably health. Specifically, the Bank prepared a series o f briefs
covering macro-issues and sectoral priorities, and consolidated and expanded i t s analytical work on
governance. At the government’s request, the Bank also prepared several unscheduled policy notes. In
addition, analytical efforts provided usefbl inputs for the preparation o f the national poverty reduction
strategy - an interim version o f which was completed during the CAS period - and for the definition o f
the new government’s reform agenda.
20.
The lending strategy was characterized by a two-track approach distinguishing between key
economic and infrastructure sectors and social sectors. Assistance to the former required clear
demonstration o f commitment to reform, while in the case o f the latter reforms were expected to go handin-hand with Bank support. In line with the dominant institutional thinking and the prevalent perception
o f Bangladesh as a “poor performer,” Bank involvement in sectors such as banking, power and water whose progress was linked to the CAS triggers - required an acceptable roadmap for reform, credible
leadership, and demonstrated commitment through progress on reforms related to governance and
structural issues. In social sectors such as health and education, on the other hand, assistance was
provided without waiting for reforms, due to the Bank’s commitment to help Bangladesh protect and
consolidate human development achievements and meet critical poverty reduction needs.
21.
Several mechanisms for delivery o f Bank assistance supported the lending strategy:
promoting private sector participation in key sectors and NGO service delivery in social sectors;
supporting “islands o f excellence” in rural infi-astructure and microcredit; and strengthening partnerships
with development partners.’* Accordingly, rather than lending in the financial sector, or in infrastructure
development and gas production, the CAS emphasized IDA’Srole in supporting policy, institutional and
structural reforms to promote private participation. The objective was for IDA to help remove policy and
institutional constraints and for MIGA and IFC to facilitate investments to increase private sector
presence in these sectors. Moreover, IDA was not expected to get involved in areas where the private
sector or other donors had been engaged for long and/or had a comparative advantage. Siniultaneously,
through several poverty-focused interventions, IDA lending was to be extended, as in the past, to several
“islands o f excellence.” These included the Rural Electrification Board and the successful rural
electricity cooperatives (Palli Bidyut Samiti or PBSs), PKSF (Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation) - an apex
financing organization for microfinance, and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED).

22.
Although the overall approach was sound, i t s implementation was hindered by the difficult
reform agenda underlying the CAS. The CAS triggers reflected the mixed track record o f reforms in
Bangladesh, the sequencing o f reform actions that had worked in other developing countries, and the need
to deepen the reform agenda. However, given the political economy and institutional constraints o f the
country, making progress on such a challenging agenda proved difficult. The CAS expected that a new
government, if committed to reforms, could manage to build consensus and overcome entrenched vested
interests to initiate comprehensive reforms soon after coming into office, and to maintain steady progress
afterwards. In practice, the government succeeded in giving momentum to the reform program in 2003 by

’* For further details on NGOs and donor partnerships see Section E.
91

taking advantage o f opportunities for reform, but these varied across sectors. As should have been
expected, reform progress has thus been incremental and uneven.

23.
In addition, the lending approach to key economic and infrastructure sectors made it
particularly difficult for the Bank to develop the country program and to contribute to several CAS
outcomes. Not only Bank financial assistance, but also sector composition o f the lending program
remained limited for most o f the CAS period due to the difficulty faced by the government in meeting the
key reforms required by the Bank. The lending approach also increased the challenge for Bank
engagement, which was constrained by the Bank’s withdrawal from supporting public investments in
infrastructure sub-sectors where the private sector was expected to play a greater role. Moreover, during
FY02 and FY03, governance concerns, especially corruption, and lack o f progress on decentralization and
municipal reform, further constrained lending assistance to sectors such as water and urban infrastructure.
The result was a difficult and at times tense dialogue that translated into repeatedly unsuccessful attempts
to provide lending assistance as made evident by the many projects inbanking, power and water that were
dropped between FYOO and FY03. Many o f these projects had been in and out o f the pipeline several
times (see Section D and Table E for M e r details on the evolution o f the country program). As the
CAS period advanced, the Country Team found itself increasingly constrained in i t s endeavor to be
selective and to maximize the Bank’s comparative advantage while developing a lending program
relevant to CAS objectives and outcomes.
In the meantime, Bank lending to health and education continued although reform progress
24.
in these sectors was relatively slow until recently, and several surveys included these sectors among
the most corrupt in the country. Poor country ownership and lack o f good local fit resulted in slow
implementation o f the reforms proposed for the health sector. By FY03, after about five years o f
implementation o f the Health and Population Sector Program with support from a donor consortium led
by the Bank, none o f the agreed reforms had been fully implemented, and people, including the poor,
were increasingly purchasing health services from the largely unregulated, non-public sector. In
education, according to QAG and OED assessments, the Bank had missed crucial opportunities to
promote reforms to improve quality, especially through the two operations supporting increased access to
girls’ education.

25.
The strategic approach was reconsidered in the FY03 C A S Progress Report in light of
Bangladesh’s I-PRSP, and the emerging lessons from C A S implementation. Supported by the
improvement in country performance and its moving into the base-case scenario, the Bank initiated a shift
toward both increased engagement in critical sectors and broad-based programmatic support. This
strategic shift was marked at the general level by emphasizing the opportunistic nature o f reforms in
Bangladesh; and specifically by providing adjustment lending for the first time since the mid-l990s,
complemented by a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement from the
IMF. As a result, FY04 became a transitional year characterized by intensified efforts to increase the
levels o f Bank engagement in infrastructure in general and power in particular, and to support reforms in
a more flexible manner.

CAS Outcomes: Progress and Bank Contribution
26.
The C A S was not a results-based strategy, but it included planned measures and milestones,
as well as performance intermediate indicators, from which a set of outcomes under each CAS
objective has been derived for t h i s report. As generally happened across the Bank, monitoring progress
was not sufficiently emphasized during CAS implementation. Keeping t h i s factor in mind, the progress

92

made in CAS outcomes and the Bank’s contribution are described below and detailed in Table A.I3
While progress across most outcomes was generally good, it mainly took place towards the end o f the
CAS period.
CAS Objective 1: Accelerating Broad-based Economic Growth

27.
Under this objective, the Bank planned to support efforts to improve the environment for
private investment, and through IFC and MIGA, promote private investment in energy,
infrastructure, manufacturing, and services. Accordingly, the areas emphasized in the CAS included
improving macroeconomic management; establishing an efficient fnancial sector; furthering trade
liberalization, export growth, and diversification; and removing infrastructure constraints. During the
CAS period, the first three areas showed encouraging progress, although external factors affected export
growth in FYOl and FY02, including a global economic slowdown and deteriorating terms o f trade.
Reducing infi-astructure constraints was the most challenging outcome partially because o f the scarcity o f
public resources and the low response by private sector. The business environment deterred investors and
kept their confidence low, which in turn also affected the ability o f IFC to make investments. In the
meantime, however, IFC started to address the needs o f smaller businesses through investments in the
financial sector and technical assistance through the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF).
Overall, the Bank contributed to this CAS objective with analytical work and, for the first time since the
mid-1990s, with adjustment lending.
28.
Macroeconomic management improved during the C A S period. Macroeconomic stability was
restored and sustained, and with Bank and Fund assistance, a sound medium-term macroeconomic
framework was developed. Good progress was achieved in the CAS outcomes relevant to this objective,
including improving quality o f public expenditure, increasing domestic resource mobilization, and
alleviating the fiscal burden o f State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Several indicators help make t h i s
progress clear: from 5.1 percent o f GDP in FYO1, the central government overall fiscal deficit fell to 3.5
percent in FY03, reflecting improved revenue collection. Modernization o f the National Board o f
Revenue (NBR) was initiated, which w i l l help in the medium term to deal with administrative
inefficiencies that currently hinder efforts to improve the poor tax-GDP ratio o f the country. A new
Privatization Policy was approved in 2002, but the role o f the Privatization Commission was not properly
defined. Nevertheless, net losses o f SOEs fell by more than half between FYOl and FY03, and
employment in SOE manufacturing was reduced by over 25 percent.I4 In FY04, increased political
pressure and opposition to retrenchment in some areas led to the Government’s decision to put on hold
the closure or privatization o f manufacturing SOEs until after the 2006 elections. Partial retrenchment
coupled with a freeze on new recruitment for SOEs w i l l be implemented in the meantime. In addition to
the assistance provided through the Development Support Credit in FY03 and a second DSC (FY05), the
Bank agreed to finance retroactively in FY04 and regularly through FY06 a good portion o f the voluntary
retirement schemes (VRS) needed to implement SOE restructuring.

At the same time, Bangladesh made encouraging progress towards establishing an efficient
29.
financial sector. This progress was reflected in two CAS outcomes, namely increasing the autonomy and
regulatory capacity o f the Bangladesh Bank and improving the management o f Nationalized Commercial
Banks (NCBs). The government, with assistance from the Bank and the IMF, evaluated the strengths,
potential vulnerabilities and key development opportunities o f the financial sector. Implementation o f the
reforms identified as critical to improving the sector gained momentum in FY03, and were supported
was limited by the lack o f baseline and recent data, and the difficulty in observing significant changes in
some o f the outcomes due to the shortness o f the CAS period. Establishing with confidence direct cause and effect between
the Bank’s contribution and a specific outcome was also challenging given the relative size o f the country program vis-a-vis
Bangladesh’s development needs, the presence o f many other actors, and the influence o f exogenous factors.
l4T h i s progress was impacted by higher fuel costs in FY04 that resulted in increased losses in some energy SOEs.

through the DSC and linked to the Fund’s PRGF arrangement. Following legal amendments that brought
NCBs under the Bangladesh Bank’s supervision, institutional capacity building for the latter was started
in FY04 with IDA financing and WBI support. A comprehensive strategy to define resolution options for
NCBs and address the existing stock o f non-performing loans was adopted in FY04, along with actions to
improve NCB management. IFC also contributed to financial sector outcomes though a guarantee for
local currency financing to the leasing sector, while continuing to support the largest private sector
housing lender in the country. Furthermore, IFC and SEDF continued to promote the development o f
local capital markets and a competitive banking sector in Bangladesh, with specific emphasis on
increasing financing opportunities for small and mediumenterprises.

30.
Making progress in trade liberalization as well as export promotion and diversification was
difficult. Among the relevant CAS outcomes, reducing anti-export bias in the trade regime advanced
slowly, while establishing a clear post-MFA strategy did not receive sufficient attention. Although the
Bank supported the modest progress made in overall tariff and customs reforms, Bank contribution to
these outcomes was less than initially envisaged. Whereas average protection decreased from 27 percent
to 22 percent in FY03, some reversal in trade liberalization actually took place in FY04 as non-tariff
measures tended to offset the effect o f lower custom duties. Bangladesh was considered then the most
protected economy in South Asia, and the challenge was to continue trade liberalization while reducing
the country’s dependence on import taxes as a revenue source. A post-MFA strategy was prepared with
Bank assistance, but this effort did not lead to concrete results. The IFC, however, established a trade
enhancement facility that operated as a risk sharing facility between Standard Chartered Bangladesh, the
Netherlands Development Corporation (FMO), and IFC. Despite some delays inutilization o f the facility
by the six participating private sector banks, the facility’s overall performance compared favorably with
IFC’s experience in other countries interms o f both average utilization rate and return.
Reducing infrastructure constraints continued to be one o f the most critical issues for
31.
accelerating Bangladesh’s development. Among the expected CAS outcomes, quality and coverage o f
the transport sector increased and conditions in the telecommunications sector improved. With IDAfinanced technical assistance, the capacity o f the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory
Commission (BTRC) was strengthened. Overall performance and competition o f the sector improved,
although implementation o f a transparent inter-connection framework was s t i l l pending in FY04. With
support from IFC, the country’s cellular network continued to expand. Telecommunication services in
mal areas were specifically targeted through investments in GrameeriPhone that helped to expand the
network and the successful Village Phone Program.
32.
Progress was limited in two key CAS outcomes related to infrastructure constraints, namely
enhancing availability and efficiency o f the energy sector and improving port facilities. Between
FYOl and FY04, the reliability o f the country’s electricity supply improved, systems losses experienced a
sustained reduction from 35 to 30 percent (of total generation), and revenue generation collection
increased from 60 to 70 percent (of generated electricity). Bangladesh also made progress in rationalizing
the distribution system as a good portion o f the mal service areas were transferred, with Bank assistance,
from the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) to the adjoining rural electricity cooperatives
(PBSs). Moreover, private sector participation in gas and electricity increased: in mid-2004, the private
sector was responsible for over a fifth o f gas production and a third o f electricity generation.
Nevertheless, power shortages and outages continued to impose substantial costs on the economy, along
with inadequate access, poor quality, and high transaction cost o f services. Only 31 percent o f the
population had access to electricity, while inadequacy o f power supply continued to be one o f the main
obstacles to private investment in the country. Critically, inefficiencies in port operations remained
unchanged due to difficulty in initiating reforms.

94

‘

33.
Reform in the energy sector advanced modestly. An Energy Regulatory Commission was
established, based on the 2003 ERC Act. The same year, an interim pricing framework for electricity, gas
and petroleum products was adopted in the country. However, energy price adjustments did not advance
beyond an initial increase in residential urban tariffs in September 2003, and an increase o f kerosene
prices to parity with diesel prices in May 2004. Due to specific concerns with inflation and i t s impact on
the poor, the Government found it difficult to adjust national prices for gas and petroleum products. In
turn, it faced substantial financial costs because o f the national prices did not reflect rising global
petroleum prices.
34.
Bank assistance for the public sector investments needed in power was low. Both a Power
Sector Reform APL and a Power Sector Technical Assistance Project - listed in the CAS as reserve
operations - were dropped in FY02 after several years in the pipeline without the country making the
upfront reforms required for IDA assistance. In the interim, the Bank supported m a l electrification while
continuing to help promote private sector participation. Specifically, the Bank contributed to the
establishment o f Haripur (360 MW) and Meghnaghat (450 M Y ) independent power producers through an
IDA partial r i s k guarantee for the former and the on-lending o f IDA funds via IDCOL (a fiiancial
intermediary) for the latter. At the same time, IFC supported the first independent power producer in
Bangladesh through a B loan syndication (US$19 million), the largest to date inthe country.
CAS Obiective 2: Consolidating HumanDevelopnient Gains

35.
The Bank expected to contribute during FYO1-FY04 to strengthen the health, nutrition, and
population sector; and improve access and quality of the education system in Bangladesh, while
helping to deal with emerging challenges such as H I V / A I D S and arsenicosis. During the CAS period,
the country continued to make gains in health indicators, which compare favorably with other countries o f
similar income levels. In FYOl and FY02, consistent with the low-case scenario, the Bank focused on
health and education - despite governance concerns - in addition to rural infi-astructure and microfinance,
supporting sector reforms simultaneously with the provision o f IDA hancing. Slow progress on reforms
dealing with systemic problems such as quality o f service delivery and equity o f access affected overall
sectoral impact o f Bank assistance. Efforts to promote the role o f NGOs in health service delivery also
faced bottlenecks and delayed implementation o f several critical programs.
36.
Despite the shortcomings o f the sectorwide program, Bangladesh’s health sector improved
during the CAS period. While suffering from teething pains as a first generation sector-wide approach
(SWAP) prepared in 1998, the Health and Population Sector Program, supported by a donor consortium
led by the Bank, helped improve coordination and development assistance to the sector. More concretely,
the Program contributed to the related CAS outcomes, including improving the capacity o f the Ministry
o f Health and Family Welfare; and increasing the level o f service quality and utilization at district and
sub-district (thana) levels. I t also helped prioritize sector and targeted expenditures, especially on
programs that benefited children, women, and the poor. Over the medium term, the Program helped
improve several health indicators linked to the MDGs, thus contributing to better development impact o f
health investments. Implementation o f the reform agenda and program activities, however, advanced
slowly due to the devastating 1998 floods and the change o f government. More directly related to
program design and scale, there were initial implementation demands that overwhelmed government and
Bank capacity to deal with financial management and procurement rnatter~.’~
37.
Community-based nutrition programs were successfully piloted, but their scaling up fell
short o f expectations. Implementation o f the IDA-financed Integrated Nutrition Program was successful,
as corroborated by OED and an independent evaluation study. Bank contribution to helping the country
The Program’s mid-term review identified procurement as the single most critical operational issue.

95

improve nutrition status by scaling up t h i s effort was affected by various factors. First, disagreements
between the Bank and the Government delayed approval by the latter o f the national program, which
could not take o f f until late FY03 - almost two years after Bank approval. Second, scaling up was decided
before the lessons from the previous effort had been clearly assimilated. Results w i l l not be at the level
initially expected given that the program was scaled down, resulting in the cancellation o f about 25
percent (US25 million) o f IDA credit funds.
38.
Slow progress was made in establishing the capacity to prevent HIVIAIDS and to respond
to the arsenic crisis, although the two IDA-financed projects dealing with these issues had been
processed quickly to provide assistance in a timely manner. In both cases, this lackluster record was
due in part to project design issues and unsuitable implementation arrangements. The HIV/AIDS
Prevention Project was approved in FYOl to take advantage o f the window o f opportunity provided by
the low incidence o f HIV infections prevalent in Bangladesh. M e r a substantial delay, the project’s
activities were scaled down in FY03 and about 55 percent o f IDA credit funds (US$22 million) cancelled.
As a result, the expected impact o f the project has been substantially reduced.

39.
Support to the country’s efforts to deal with the arsenic problem started in FY99 through
analytical work and the IDA-financed Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project. The project’s design was
particularly constrained by the fact that the size and extent o f the health problem was - and s t i l l i s - not
exactly known, while no credible treatment to deal with arsenicosis was available. Progress was
eventually made under the project in carrying out the emergency measures (i.e., screening tubewells,
preparing community plans, etc.), but providing safe drinking water options proved more difficult.
Implementation o f innovative pilots to establish piped-water schemes could only be started in FY03,
complemented by similar efforts under the IDA-financed Social Investment Program. Planned Bank
lending assistance to help address the public health aspects o f arsenicosis, on the other hand, could not
materialize due to different views between the Bank and the Government regarding the proposed project’s
design and implementation arrangements.
Bangladesh continued to make progress in increasing access to education during the F Y O 1 40.
04 period, but quality remains a major concern. With respect to CAS outcomes, steady progress was
made in improving primary and secondary educational outcomes; improving quality o f teachers,
curriculum, and textbooks; and in improving equity in education. This progress was achieved through the
initial implementation o f a medium-term sector reform program, which the Bank planned to support with
adjustment lending (FY05), and the extension o f the sectonvide approach to primary education
development. Overall impact o f the Primary Education Development Project was affected by the fact that
what was originally designed as a sector program became a set o f 25 discrete projects supported by
different development partners, including the Bank. Due to the lack o f implementation capacity, project
coordination was not adequate, leading to disjointed interventions under many sub-components such as
teacher training, curriculum development, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Based on the lessons
learned, the second Primary Education Development Program was prepared in FY04 as a multi-donor
assisted SWAP that helped advance harmonization efforts in the country. Additional progress in
education-related CAS outcomes was achieved through the implementation o f the stipend and tuition
program to increase girls’ access to secondary education. During the first IDA-financed phase o f the
program, completed inmid-2001, enrollment o f girls in project schools more than doubled, growing from
462,000 to 948,000. Although less than a third o f the g i r l s entering grade 10 passed the school leaving
examination, their being enrolled likely resulted in delayed marriage, which in time could contribute to
lowering the fertility rate.16 The second phase, also financed by IDA, aims at providing stipends to 1.45
*6

Although OED considered that project outcome as moderately satisfactory, both OED and QAG questioned some o f the project
achievements due to inadequate attention to quality issues, low achievement levels in the Secondary School Certification
(SCC) exams, and failure to target the stipends to the poorest segments o f the population.

96

million girls. Contrastingly, projects to expand the provision o f post-literacy and continuing education
had limited results, despite assistance from the Bank and other development partners. The future o f these
efforts became uncertain in FY04 with the elimination o f the Directorate o f Non-formal Education
@NFE).17
CAS Obiective 3: Implementingan Integrated Approach to Rural Develonment
During the CAS period, the Bank planned to support Bangladesh's efforts to promote
41.
growth in agricultural and non-farm activities, make opportunities and assets available to the poor,
and improve access to r u r a l infrastructure and social services. Rural and agricultural growth was not
as impressive dwing the CAS period as it was in the late 1990s. ARer a rapid growth rate o f 5 percent per
year throughout the second half o f the 1990s, the agricultural sector suffered a deceleration that resulted
in an annual average growth o f around 2 percent during 2001-2003. Moreover, wage rates in the sector
continued to stagnate despite relatively healthy GDP growth.
42.
Bank contribution to rural growth did not have the impact expected in the CAS. Analytical
work on the agriculture sector was completed in FY03, but was not sufficiently disseminated, while work
on rural non-faxm growth was only completed in FY04. Although a rural development strategy was
finalized in 2000, t h i s effort could not be made operational through specific projects to help promote rural
growth. Bank support directed to agricultural diversification, at the same time, had minimal impact. As
part o f Bank support to the latter, a small effort to promote horticulture exports was implemented, which
by definition could only provide modest results. A study on agribusiness sponsored jointly by IDA and
DFID did not help identify any concrete interventions. The plan to help finance an Agribusiness
Development Project was subsequently abandoned.

43.
Progress towards improving agricultural research and extension and water management
capacity was slow. IDA-financed efforts to improve research and extension and strengthen their links did
not have the expected impact. Modest progress was made in rationalizing extension services throughout
the cowitry. In addition, some progress was made in improving the operation o f individual agricultural
research institutes in terms o f program prioritization, adoption o f a fanning systems approach, and
following up a research grants scheme. On the other hand, the institutional weaknesses o f the Bangladesh
Agricultural Research Council (BARC) - particularly in areas such as research policy development, and
research financing and budgeting - were not adequately addressed, and as a result the overall efficiency
o f the national research system remained low. The plan to continue improving water resource
management capacity suffered delays, as Bank financial support to the water sector was put on hold in
FY02 by regional management due to governance concerns. Nevertheless, progress was made in building
capacity in the Water Resource Planning Organization (WARPO) and in restructuring the Bangladesh
Water Development Board (BWDB), two key sector agencies. In addition, the National Water
Management Plan, completed with Bank assistance, was approved in March 2004 - a major
accomplishment considering that two past attempts to develop this plan had failed due to entrenched
opposition. l8
44.
Efforts to make opportunities and assets available to the poor produced good results.
Progress was made in most o f the expected outcomes, although in different degrees: increasing access to
nlicrocredit continued successfully, positive steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f social
safety nets were implemented, and assessing whether these provide a better alternative i s ongoing. In
contrast, increasing access to safe drinking water proved to be a more difficult task, although rapid

Government, NGOs, and development partners have since started to work together to develop a National Framework for
Non-formal Education.
Building on these achievements, IDA assistance will be provided in FY05 to improve water management capacity.

97

progress was made starting in late FY03 (see above). The f i s t IDA-fmanced microfinance project,
completed during the CAS period, exceeded i t s target o f total borrowers by 75 percent, reaching 2.1
million people (90 percent o f which were women), while strengthening the institutional capacity o f
PKSF, the apex agency for the sector. Scaling up efforts continued through a second IDA-financed
microfinance operation, and through a Lending and Innovation Credit to test alternative delivery models
to extend microfmance services to the poorest, hardest-to-reach households. Efforts to increase income
opportunities for the poor through fisheries, silk development and high-value horticulture produce - all o f
which were actively supported by the Bank and other donors - were not as successful.
Access to rural infrastructure continued to expand during the CAS period. This expansion
45.
was achieved through investments, consistently financed by the Bank, in rural roads, rural markets, and
electrification; and by piloting community-driven approaches to deliver social services and infrastructure
assets to the poor. Disaster vulnerability was further reduced through the expansion and rehabilitation of
riverbank protection works and coastal embankments, as well as through implementation o f cyclone
mitigation measures. Rehabilitation o f polders, at the same time, helped increase agricultural production
in the targeted areas. Independent evaluations show that IDA-financed rural roads and markets projects
helped increase the marketing o f agricultural products and the revenues o f farmers with improved access,
while also helping to diversify the non-agricultural employment opportunities o f land-poor households
and to generate employment for destitute women.
General CAS Objective: Improving Governance and Strengthening Institutions

46.
Governance improvement was at the core of the Bank strategy, but progress on t h i s broad
objective was slow and the impact of B a n k efforts modest. As mentioned earlier, at the sector level the
Bank promoted the establishment o f regulatory entities in energy and telecommunications, while
promoting institutional reforms in banking and the water sector. A t the general level, the Bank expected
to promote anti-corruption measures and legal and judicial reform; and to help initiate public
administration reform as well as decentralization and local capacity building.
47.
Several anti-corruption measures were initiated, but their impact will only become evident
in the medium to long term. Legislation to establish the Anti-Corruption Commission was approved by
Parliament in February 2004. The Commission, however, was not operative and the Anti-Corruption
Strategy was incomplete at the end o f the CAS period. The process o f separation o f the judiciary and
executive advanced slowly due to the complexity o f the task at hand.Ig
48.
As with the previous CAS, public administration reforms were among the most challenging
to implement as these did not figure prominently in the government’s agenda. m e r several years in
preparation, a public sector modernization program to be financed by the Bank - considered a key
element o f the CAS program - was dropped from the pipeline in FY02. In FY03, modest steps included
in the Development Support Credit to change staff promotion rules were implemented, along with a hiring
freeze for the lower levels o f the civil service. These actions notwithstanding, at the end o f the CAS
period public administration remained rigid and not very efficient, representing one o f the main obstacles
to smooth implementation o f development programs and projects. In consequence, delivery o f Bank
assistance continued to be constrained by civil service d e s , politicization o f the bureaucracy, and the
short tenures o f senior bureaucrats.
49.
In contrast, public financial management and procurement capacity improved in recent
years. With additional support from development partners, several o f the recommendations o f the
l 9 The Judicial Services Commission was formed. However, the status o f magistrates remained unresolved, as they would prefer
to remain under the civil service administration.

98

Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) were implemented, including, among others, the
separation o f the audit and accounting functions, and the establishment o f intemal audit committees in
selected ministries and autonomous agencies. At the same time, following the recommendations o f the
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), a Central Procurement Technical Unit was
established, a Procurement Law was drafted, and public procurement regulations issued to change the old
system completely. In addition to the analytical work, IDA-financed technical assistance was instrumental
in achieving this progress.
50.
Modest steps were made to improve the civil judicial system and increase access to justice.
Implementation o f the judicial reform program supported by IDA and other donors helped initiate reforms
in the Supreme Court and selected district courts. During the CAS period, Money Loan Courts for
financial disputes and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism (ADR) were established.
51.
On the other hand, in FY04 the structure and plan for decentralization remained unclear.
Bank efforts to promote decentralization issues did not produce any concrete results, despite the
Government’s professed intention o f establishing strong local government at various levels. In the end,
the pilot effort to test models o f decentralization listed as a reserve project in the CAS could not
materialize.
Crosscutting; Issues: Addressing Social and Environmental Issues
52.
Environmental management capacity did not improve during the CAS period. To help build
t h i s capacity, the Bank planned to support alleviation o f air pollution in Dhaka, execute the policy
coniponent o f the UNDP-assisted Sustainable Environmental Management Program (SEMP), and
promote better environmental assessment procedures across all Government line agencies. Bangladesh
made progress in improving the forest management system with Bank assistance, which also helped
expand mangrove plantations with community participation. Alleviation o f urban air pollution in Dhaka
was an area o f relative success to which the Bank also contributed directly. After the removal o f the twostroke three wheelers, the next challenge to address i s the influx o f diesel commercial vehicles. In 2002,
however, the Bank had to withdraw from SEW due to disagreement between the Ministry o f
Environment and Forestry (MOED) and UNDP, and the Bank’s concerns with governance in the sector.
More positively, a Country Environmental Analysis was initiated in FY04 with Bank and other
development partners’ support to help strengthen the environmental foundation o f the PRSP.
53.
The gender equity agenda remains substantial, even though Bangladesh made further
progress in girls’ education, microfinance, and expansion o f income generation opportunities for
women. Partially due to achievements in these areas, the country met the MDG in gender equality in
primary and secondary enrolment. Health and nutrition program implemented with IDA financing
effectively targeted women and their children. The Government recognized the importance o f promoting
women’s advancement by making this one o f the five pillars o f the I-PRSP. Currently, gender inequalities
persist in accessing and controlling resources and in taking advantage o f economic opportunities.
Although tougher laws were recently enacted against throwing acid on women, Bangladesh s t i l l has a
high incidence o f violence against women.
54.
CAS implementation did not generate any substantial negative social and environmental
impacts. The Government dealt with the initial social impact o f SOE closures relatively well, and
planned to enhance consultations with labor and promote income generation opportunities and retraining
to minimize this impact.20In FY04, the closing o f some SOEs resulted in social disturbances that led to
For example, to mitigate social impact of SOE retrenchment, the Government will implement a micro-enterprise and
counseling component (US$10 million) financed by DFID under the Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project.

their temporary reopening. The Bank, at the same time, was slow in supporting the implementation o f a
Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) to understand the full implication o f many o f the reforms
under consideration or implementation.
Overall Assessment o f CAS Performance

55.
Based on the analysis of outcome progress, CAS performance i s considered marginally
satisfactory, while the overall impact o f Bank assistance remained modest. In general, Bank
assistance contributed to development progress in Bangladesh during the CAS period, but not at the
expected levels. The Bank supported more effectively the objective o f consolidating human development
gains, followed by accelerating broad-based growth. Assistance to improve governance was less
successful, but the Bank helped to initiate important steps toward improving the regulatory framework in
telecommunications and energy, initiating institutional change in the water sector, strengthening fiduciary
systems, and developing anti-corruption measures.
56.
The modest support to agriculture and r u r a l non-farm growth, and the limited impact in
the financial sector, indicate that the Bank’s contribution to help Bangladesh move closer to i t s
growth potential was less than originally envisaged. In the case o f the financial sector, the full impact
o f Bank support was not fully evident yet, since the reform program was in the early stages o f
implementation in FY04.

57.
As shown in Section D, the lending program evolved without a complete understanding of
the impact of program changes on C A S outcomes. Some o f these outcomes seem ambitious in
retrospective, particularly if the prevalent country and institutional conditions are taken into
consideration. Consequently, the Bank’s contribution to several CAS outcomes was lower than expected,
particularly in outcomes related to promoting agricultural growth and diversification, reducing
infrastnxcture constraints, improving public administration, and supporting local government
strengthening.
58.
In addition, CAS performance was affected by the Bank’s difficulty in engaging the
government in critical areas such as public administration reform and decentralization. Both o f
these areas were prominently discussed in the FYOl CAS document, but lacked country ownership and

better understanding o f reform constraints.

59.
Despite these limitations, Bank assistance helped Bangladesh make further progress toward
the MDGs, particularly those related to human development. Major health and education sector
governance changes are s t i l l required to secure t h i s progress, however. Even Bangladesh’s much-touted
reduction in total fertility i s at risk unless health sector policy i s improved. Finally, the Bank was less
successful in helping the country accelerate progress toward the MDG targets related to environmental
sustainability.
D.

Bank Performance

60.
In June 2004, total IDA net commitments amounted to US$2.5 billion, while the IFC
portfolio stood at US$166.6 million. At the same time, undisbursed IDA commitments totaled US$1.7
billion. The Bank Group portfolio inBangladesh included 25 IDA Credits, 4 IDA Grants, 2 GEF Grants,
one IDA guarantee (see Table D for portfolio details), as well as 11 IFC-sponsored projects. Between
F Y O l and FY04, IDA commitments amounted to US$1.68 billion and IFC commitments US123.1
million.

Delivery - Bank Assistance during the CAS Period

61.
The lending program included in the FYOl CAS proved to be very tentative, while limited
to investment and technical assistance credits (see Table B for details). The l i s t o f dropped projects
presented in Table D shows the difficulties faced by the Country Team in initiating or maintaining Bank
involvement in sectors such as urban infrastructure, ports, banking, energy, water, and especially
agriculture.21 In FYOO, during CAS preparation, nine projects were dropped from the portfolio. Eight
projects were dropped in each o f the two subsequent fiscal years. By FY03, the pipeline had become thin
and identification o f viable projects increasingly challenging. The program continued to change during
FY04 as the Bank attempted to respond to I-PRSP priorities and to IDA 13 resource constraints. Despite
these efforts, the array o f instruments available to deliver Bank financial support remained quite limited.
The intention noted in the CAS o f using sector wide approaches beyond the health sector only became
possible in FY04 through the second phase o f the primary education development program. Adjustment
lending could only be provided in FY03, when Bangladesh finally moved into the base case.
62.
A disconnect can be observed between the lending and nonlending programs. Analytical and
advisory activities (AAA) were for the most part delivered as listed in the CAS. In FY04, however, AAA
delivery slowed down significantly (see Table C). In general, AAA delivery was advanced without
adjusting to the changes in the lending program. This situation stemmed, to some extent, from the
strategic decision to focus the nonlending program on overall governance, poverty and reform issues,
rather than on supporting lending development through formal sector work. With the exception o f the
agricultural and non-farm rural sectors, health, and to a lesser degree education, formal sector work was
minimal during the CAS period.
63.
Despite the wide array of C A S outcomes, most of the commitments made between FYO1-04
were concentrated on a few sectors, resulting in an active portfolio dominated by transportation,
health, energy and education. Among the 19 investment and technical assistance projects approved
during the CAS period, rural infrastructure, represented in rural roads and electrification projects,
received the largest amount o f new IDA commitments (US$381 million). This type o f projects was
followed closely by education projects, which received US$375 million. Together, these two set o f
projects received 45 percent o f FY01-04 IDA commitments. SOE and banking reform received the third
largest amount (US$287 million, or close to 17 percent o f total), while support to scaling-up microfinance
was next (US$156 million or 9 percent o f total)?2 This pattern, combined with the fact that 16 projects
closed and six projects were extended, contributed to the concentration o f the portfolio in transportation,
health, energy - including rural electrification and support to increasing private sector provision,23and the
education sector.
64.
Delivery of Bank assistance was hindered by the limited access to IDA resources
experienced by Bangladesh. The country could only access about 80 percent (US$1.15 billion) o f i t s
FY1-03 IDA allocation as it continued in the low-case scenario for the f i r s t two years o f the CAS period.
In addition, recent analysis indicates that the country performance rating, and by extension the IDA
allocation for Bangladesh, may have been further reduced due to the formula, and particularly the
governance factor, applied to estimate this rating. Significantly, when the country moved to the base case
in FY03, the lending target o f US$715 million set in the CAS could not be met, partially because o f the
Financial support to the water sector, for example, was supposed to reach over 30 percent o f the initial FYOI-03 lending
program, but never materialized due to the factors previously mentioned. Public power sector investment credits (Le., Power
Sector Technical Assistance and Power Sector I1 Dispatch and Transmission) included in the “reserve list” could not come
to fruition either, pending actual reforms.
22 Commitments for health projects only reached US$40 million (for HIV/AIDS prevention) due to the delay in preparing the
second phase o f the SWAP and the decision to drop the Arsenic Public Health Project
23 This amount does not include the IDA guarantee for the Haripur Power Project (US$60.9 million).

thin pipeline. Despite these problems, Bangladesh remained among the ten largest recipients o f IDA
resources during the CAS period, and in FY03 was in fact the largest IDA-only recipient and second
overall afier India.

65.
In addition, most IDA resources were committed late in the CAS period. Almost half o f total
FY01-03 commitments were approved in the last quarter o f FY03, and most o f the FY04 commitments
were scheduled for June. In fact, the adjustment lending provided in FY03 is equivalent to over 50
percent o f that year’s commitments and over 17 percent o f total FYO1-04 commitments. The adjustment
support (US$300 million) planned for FY04 slipped into the first quarter o f FY05. As shown earlier,
however, the reform measures supported by these adjustment credits helped advance CAS outcomes in
FY04.
66.
Simultaneously, disbursements experienced a serious slowdown, reflecting slow project
implementation. Over 50 percent o f FY01-03 total disbursements took place in FY03 thanks to the
provision o f one-tranche adjustment support. That year, at the same time, disbursements related to
investment and TA projects were down by almost 20 percent with respect to the average for the two
previous fiscal years. T h i s trend is also evident in the country’s disbursement ratio (net o f adjustment
lending), which, after reaching levels o f 20 percent or more in FYO1 and FY02, decreased to 16.4 percent
in FY03 and stayed at almost the same level in FY04. At the end o f the latter, total gross and net
disbursements (US$228 million and US$98 million, respectively) for the year had reached unprecedented
low levels, reflecting a larger pattern o f very low utilization o f project aid by B a n g l a d e ~ h . ~ ~
Credit fund cancellations also increased, mainly because of the need to restructure problem
67,
projects. In total, about US$220.0 million in IDA funds, equivalent to 19 percent o f FY01-03
commitments, were cancelled during the same peri0d.2~Most o f the cancellations (US$152.9 million or
almost 70 percent o f total for the period) took place in FY03, and affected several projects that were
critical to achieving CAS outcomes. These included HIV/AIDS Prevention (50 percent o f credit
cancelled); S i l k Development Pilot Project (45 percent); Dhaka Urban Transport (37 percent); 26 Primary
Education Development (30 percent); Fourth Fisheries (30 percent); Fourth Dhaka Water Supply (30
percent); and National Nutrition (25 percent).
Portfolio Assessment

68.
IDA Portfolio performance was unsatisfactory during most of the CAS period. IFC
portfolio performance was satisfactory, with non-performing loans below the IFC norm. The FYO1
CAS recognized that portfolio performance had been below the Bank’s average. Between FYOl and
FY04, despite temporary improvements in some indicators, the portfolio continued to deteriorate. In
FY03, Bangladesh experienced the worst portfolio conditions o f recent years as the share o f projects at
risk climbed to 24 percent and commitments at risk to 33 percent.27 During FY04 the portfolio improved
slightly, and in June 2004 the percentage o f projects at risk was 17 and the percent o f commitments at risk

Between FYOl and FY04, total gross disbursements in Bangladesh reached US$1.4 billion and net disbursements US$972.6
million (of which 69 percent corresponded to investment and TA credits.)
25 About 84 percent o f cancellations were due to project restructuring and cost savings, 14 percent due to undisbursedbalances at
credit closing, and 2 percent due to misprocurement.
26 With cancellations amounting to US$64.8 million, Dhaka Urban Transport, a problem project for over two years due to overambitious design and poor institutional knowledge, was the project with the largest share o f total cancelled funds in FY03
(42.4 percent) and overall during the period (29.4 percent).
27 In comparison, FY03 Bank average for both projects at risk and commitments at r i s k was 15 percent, while the regional figures
were 17 and 14 percent, respectively.
24

102

was 24. Almost 40 percent o f the commitments at risk, however, fell under the Private Sector
Infrastructure Development Project (PSIDP), which had then been a problem project for a year.28

69.
The above trend partially reflected the strategic decision to extend several projects at r i s k ,
most of them actual problem projects, a n d o r to postpone partial credit cancellations on the basis of
the expected development impact and contribution to CAS outcomes. While the actual implication for
Bank development effectiveness has not been fully evaluated yet, the l i s t o f extensions during the CAS
period includes, in addition to PSIDP, other key projects such as Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply, Dhaka
Urban Transport, and the Health and Population Sector Program. Before being upgraded during FY04,
m y of these projects were considered problem projects for a considerable period o f time (Arsenic
Mitigation for almost two years and Dhaka Urban transport for over two years), thus affecting portfolio
indicators substantially during the CAS period. Most o f these projects suffered from the general design
and related implementation problems discussed below.
In addition to design issues, portfolio conditions also reflected slow project implementation
70.
due to difficult administrative procedures and processes. Some o f the most serious issues relate to
delays in appointing key staff, protracted consultant recruitment, including NGO contracting, and weak
procurement and financial management capacity. Although it i s expected that implementation o f the
procurement reform program w i l l help improve this situation, during the CAS period recruitment o f
consultants and awarding o f contracts continued to be affected by undue delays in the evaluation and
procurement approval process, unrealistic procurement schedules, tendency among implementation units
to re-bid, and the lack o f standardized bidding documents. Protracted government approval o f the Project
Concept Paper (PCP) and Project Proforma (PP) further delayed projects.

Quality of Products and Services
71.
Project design suffered from unrealistic expectations regarding objectives, completion
schedules, and expected results, as well as insufficient attention to institutions and political
economy. QAG assessment^^^ consistently identify lack o f clarity and realism o f project development
objectives as one o f the weakest areas in project design, which is, at the same time, found to be generally
weak. Several projects considered to be “best practice” faced serious problems because institutional and
political challenges were not well understood, and implementation arrangements andor capacity did not
correspond to country conditions. As a result, proposed policy and institutional reforms were often
integrated into projects without sufficient client ownership andor understanding o f implementation
constraints.

72.
Bank project supervision was affected by the quality and realism of reporting, and
insufficient focus on development effectiveness. On the one hand, over-ambitious monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems were proposed without a realistic implementation plan and little or no follow
up during implementation. On the other hand, an overemphasis on project inputs and disbursements,
rather than on outputs and outcomes, resulted in an inadequate measurement o f development impact.
According to QAG, supervision ratings tend to be generous in the case o f Bangladesh, which would
imply that portfolio quality i s worse than reported.
the l i s t o f problem projects in June 2004 included Municipal Services, Microfinance 11, Post-Literacy and
Continuing Education, and Fourth Fisheries.
QAG data at the country level should be analyzed cautiously given the small size o f some o f the samples. During the CAS
period, QAG assessed quality at entry (QAE) o f five projects and quality o f supervision (QSA) of 11 projects in Bangladesh.
The QSA in FYOl focused on “risky projects” and i s not comparable with the other years. Both QAE and QSA were found to
be generally satisfactory, although in the latter case Bangladesh did not perform as well as the region or the Bank as a whole.
To identify trends better, we also considered for this report a longer period, starting in FY97. This brings the sample up to 12
projects assessed for QAE and 22 for QSA (although three projects are included twice in this sample).

” In addition to PSIDP,
29

103

73.
As a result, the effectiveness and impact o f Bank lending has been mixed: while
achievement of project outcomes was mostly satisfactory, sustainability fell behind Bank averages
during the CAS period. Out o f 18 projects evaluated between FYOO and FY04, OED agreed that 14
(about 78 percent) had satisfactory outcomes. Sustainability o f project benefits was considered likely,
however, in only 10 o f these projects (about 63 percent). Bangladesh’s share o f satisfactory project
outcomes compares well with the region (81 percent) and the Bank as a whole (76 percent). In contrast, in
t e r n of sustainability, Bangladesh performed below the region (81 percent) and Bank levels (73 percent).
See Table D(a) for details o f OED ratings by closed project.
74.
Institutional development impact - an overriding concern of the CAS - was modest.
According to OED, only a third o f the evaluated projects in Bangladesh had substantial institutional
development impact. This figure i s substantially below the region (46.2 percent) and Bank (49.9 percent)
levels, which were generally low in the first place. Overall, excepting the “islands o f excellence” in
microfinance (PKSF), rural infrastructure (LGED) and rural electrification (REB), the Bank’s efforts to
help build good sector institutions in the country continued to be largely disappointing during the CAS
period.30 It should be noted that in the case o f PKSF, LGED, and REB, Bank support for capacity
building built on the successful efforts o f other development partners.
Not surprisingly, projects in r u r a l roads, rural electrification, and microfinance had a high
75.
overall impact, followed by those in education. Projects in the agriculture sector, on the other hand,
did not perform as well. OED assessments confirm that Bank assistance to Bangladesh to improve rural
infrastructure has provided clear benefits, and that over time the Bank has built a beneficial development
partnership with government in the rural electricity and transport sectors. Contrastingly, support to
agricultural research and extension services did not result in sustainable, visible impacts: sustainability o f
the Agricultural Research Management Project was rated as unlikely by OED, while that of the
Agricultural Support Services Project could not be evaluated due to “significant uncertainties about the
fhu-e.” Inboth cases, after several IDA-financed projects, institutional development remained poor.
76.
Gas and urban water supply were sectors with very poor results. M e r more than 20 years o f
assistance, the Bank has not managed to promote substantial institutional and policy reform in these
sectors. In the case o f the gas sector, overall institutional capacity o f Petrobangla remained poor and i t s
ability to deal with gas supply shortages severely limited. The Gas Mastructure Development Project,
which closed in FYOO with unsatisfactory ratings, was the fourth and last IDA credit to the sector. The
Fourth Dhaka Water Supply, the last in a succession o f Bank-supported efforts was unsatisfactory at most
levels, and considered by QAG a “no-win project from entry.” These two projects failed largely because
o f lack o f political w i l l to undertake deep systemic reforms needed in the sector, but also because o f poor
country ownership and unrealistic expectations. In the case o f Dhaka Water, additional factors were
unrealistic development objectives and poor design and appraisal that ignored the lessons o f the three
previous operation^.^'
The overall outcome of the Development Support Credit was rated as moderately
77.
satisfactory by OED, while QAG considered that the sustainability of the reform program
underpinning it was uncertain.32Although the DSC was rated as having a satisfactory quality at entry,
QAG had several concerns: Ownership o f the reforms supported by the DSC appeared weak beyond the
core government team led by the Finance Minister. Moreover, only a small team in both the Government
T h i s i s one o f the main findings o f the assessment o f Bank-supported capacity building in Bangladesh undertaken by OED in
February 2003, and also an important conclusion o f the 1998 OED Country Assistance Review.
31 QAG recommended, however, that future support to the urban water supply sector should be given only if the Bank can obtain
up-front sector reform and municipal reform addressing the systemic issues that hinder the provision of water and other public
services in the country.
32 OED concluded that the sustainability of the program included in the DSC was non-evaluable due to similar reasons.
30

104

and the Bank participated actively in i t s completion, while key stakeholders had not been consulted. QAG
thus concluded that the three-year reform program proposed in the DSC did not reflect a realistic analysis
o f institutional constraints and implementation capacity, which made it unlikely that the program could be
followed through completely.

78.
Overall quality of analytical and advisory activities during the CAS period was satisfactory
according to QAG, but their effectiveness, although encouraging, was somewhat limited?3 In
general, Q A G commended the Bank approach o f coordinated analytical work and policy advocacy on
govemance pursued especially in FYOl and FY02.34 In addition, QAG considered the strong poverty
focus o f AAA very productive. Specifically, the CFAA was rated by QAG as highly satisfactory while
the Poverty Assessment was rated as fully satisfactory. The decision to prepare the Public Expenditure
Review (PER) in parallel to the Poverty Assessment allowed the Bank and the Government to take
advantage o f the complementarities between these efforts, which provided useful inputs to the I-PRSP
and helped inform the dialogue on poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Additionally, thanks to the close
collaboration with the Bangladesh Bureau o f Statistics (BBS), the methodology used in the country to
measure poverty improved substantially. More generally, however, analytical work did not help enhance
the impact o f Bank-financed projects, to a great extent because o f the disconnect that developed between
the lending and non-lending programs. The overall impact o f governance-related work was limited by the
difficulty in translating the knowledge gained into concrete ways to deal with deep systemic issues,
particularly at the project and sector levels. T h i s difficulty was related, to some extent, to the need to
address better the political economy o f reforms.

E.

Consultation and Coordination

79.
The C A S was prepared following consultations with a wide array of stakeholders across the
country, through a process that was considered ‘best practice’ at the time. CAS dialogue was
nevertheless constrained by the political situation, which made it difficult to get attention from opposition
parties, and by strained relations with the government. Due to tinie constraints, the CAS Progress Report
did not benefit from consultation with stakeholders, although i t s draft was shared with government and
several development partners. As planned in the CAS, during the pre-election and government transition
periods, the Bank used donor meetings, interactions with civil society, and occasionally the media to
make the case for reforms, especially in governance. Engagement with civil society, however, was not
maintained at the expected levels afterwards.
80.
Partnership with government improved after the elections, but a negative perception o f the
Bank lingered throughout the CAS period. According to the Global Poll conducted in FY03, the Bank
in Bangladesh was perceived as arrogant, often acting both “irresponsibly” by proposing utlsustainable
advice, and inconsistently by not always following
T h i s perception was corroborated to some
extent by the Bangladesh Client Survey in 2004. To some extent, this perception i s the continuation o f a
historical trend that requires a concerted effort to improve staff behavior and the image o f the Bank itself.
I t stems from the high profile inherent to the Bank as a major donor and leader o f the LCG, but also from
the increased emphasis given to governance since the mid 1990s, starting with “Government that Works.”
While many Bangladeshis have welcomed this focus, others remain ambivalent or resent the “rhetoric” o f
poor governance from external agencies, especially when coupled with non-lending decisions and no
attempts to help promote an endogenous process. At the program or project level, this negative perception
QAG undertook a Country AAA Assessment in 2004, which was subsequently used as an input to the overall Country Program
Assessment.
34 The cluster of activities related to governance included in F Y O l the Governance Indicators / Citizen Report Cards, the
Institutional and Governance Review, the CFAA - prepared with UNDP, and 18 policy briefs prepared for the new
government.
35 The perception of the Bank in Bangladesh was among the worst in the region.
33

105

was perpetuated by the tendency to apply “best practice,” in reality often dogmatic solutions
indiscriminately and without sufficient understanding o f the Bangladeshi context. Such tendencies on the
part o f the Bank were reinforced by the generalized perception o f the country as a “poor performer.”

81.
The effectiveness of the Local Consultative Group (LCG), chaired b y the Bank, increased
during the CAS period. When the CAS was being prepared, government’s involvement inthe activities
o f the L C G remained limited. Moreover, the Bank and other major donors had only recently started their
efforts to bring development assistance under a common development framework and to focus on
results.36 During CAS implementation, ownership o f the L C G was expanded through the establishment
o f an Executive Committee with rotating membership, while the government’s participation in LCG
activities increased. Presently, senior officials meet periodically with the full LCG, while officials from
the line ministries meet regularly with their counterparts in L C G sub-groups. In Jan~mry2003 the
government and L C G started the Aid Governance Initiative to strengthen the quality o f administrative and
implementing processes o f externally-funded development activities in Bangladesh. Donors and
government officials worked together on four groups dealing with audits, procurement, training, and
simplification o f project documents.

82.
Increased collaboration with development partners in lending, especially through SWAPS,
and analytical work, enhanced development effectiveness. While coordination in some sectors
remained weak, partnerships in health and primary education were particularly strengthened through
sector-wide approaches. In health, both the Government and the donor consortium led by the Bank
learned to work better together through the challenging implementation process o f the first sector wide
approach. The Primary Education Program, which closed in FY04, suffered from lack o f binding donor
coordination and borrower commitment. In contrast, i t s new phase represents a good example o f donor
harmonization and partnership with the government. Based on past experience, a Code o f Conduct was
also agreed upon among participant donors to ensure decision makingby consensus and a common voice.
83.
The need for a clear legal framework emerged during C A S implementation as a central
issue to ensure NGO independence and accountability. Government and development partners, such as
the Bank, continued to support NGO efforts to expand access to microfinance. NGOs also played a role in
non-formal education, including literacy work, and in delivering health services. However, delays in
engaging NGOs affected several critical projects such as National Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Prevention.
InFY04, the Government introduced in the Parliament, but quickly withdrew after donor urging, a NGO
Bill restricting NGO autonomy and operational flexibility in response to alleged political partisanship o f
several NGOs and concerns with money laundering.37While there i s a broad consensus among NGOs and
donors that an enabling legal li-amework should be put in place to improve internal governance and
accountability o f the NGO sector, it i s also agreed that t h i s should be done through consultations with all
stakeholders.

F.

M a i n Lessons for new C A S Design and Implementation

84.
At the general level, the next CAS will need to promote the emergence of a national
consensus on reforms, support PRSP priorities, and help ensure continuity o f relevant policies and
programs. The PRSP process offers an excellent opportunity for Bangladesh to build a national
consensus on priority reforms and development programs. But more than identifying the policy measures,
the challenge for the PRSP, and by extension the new CAS, lies in ensuring that the agreed measures are
consistently implemented across the coming electoral cycle, and that progress on macroeconomic policy
During the 1999 Bangladesh Development Forum the discussion emphasized development outcomes over level-of-aid inputs
for the first time in this type o f meeting.

36

106

i s followed closely by sector reforms and legal and administrative changes. Specific lessons from the
recent CAS experience are discussed below and in Table A.

Strategic Approach

85.
As emphasized in the CAS, Bangladesh urgently needs across-theboard political and
economic governance changes to achieve faster development results and meet the MDGs. CAS
implementation showed that governance reforms are difficult and costly, especially given entrenched
vested interests and the polarized nature o f Bangladeshi politics. Thus far, however, the CAS approach to
governance reforms has been more o f a constraint than a means to enhance Bank development
effectiveness. After the modest results obtained so far, the Bank faces the challenge of developing a
more positive and constructive strategic approach to governance by moving from rhetoric to
concrete support. In practical terms, this means unbundling governance issues to implementable levels,
gaining more in-depth understanding o f these issues, and going beyond the traditional areas o f past
support to governance reform.
86.
The experience during t h i s CAS period shows that reforms cannot be advanced
comprehensively and at an even pace. The Government’s commitment to reform contributed positively
to CAS outcomes, demonstrating that progress can be made even under difficult conditions. However,
after a relatively short-lived window o f opportunity, implementation o f reforms became increasingly
harder in some sectors with the premature start o f the electoral cycle and the related intensification o f
confrontational politics. The situation w i l l become even more difficult as the 2006 elections draw closer.
This experience also indicates that increased flexibility in the reform agenda underlying the lending
performance triggers i s required. CAS triggers should deal practically with a reform path that i s not
easily predictable. The urgency with which reforms should take place needs to reflect more closely the
reality on the ground, as well as the related government’s understanding o f the feasible speed for
implementing reforms.
87.
In addition, the Bank should be endeavoring to work from within critical sectors rather
than disengaging from them while waiting for reforms to occur. CAS implementation showed that
requiring upfront, often difficult reforms before supporting sectoral investments cannot always deliver the
desired outcomes. While it i s correct to assume that, in some extreme cases, investment without reforms
w i l l not provide sustainable outcomes, investments along with reforms may often lead to better
achievement o f sectoral outcomes and overall sector development. To adopt t h i s approach, the Bank
should establish a clear set of minimum “rules o f engagement” in each sector, instead of a long list
of conditions that cannot be met even if some political will exists. The CAS should take into
consideration that the macroeconomic situation and political economy o f reform have a significant
influence in a sector’s performance as well as in the government’s ability to implement changes within
such sector. As such, it i s unrealistic to attempt to “force” actions beyond the point that i s feasible at a
particular time given constraining factors, many o f which are exogenous to the sector.
Country Program Issues

88.
C A S objectives and outcomes should reflect what can be realistically achieved within the
C A S period. Accordingly, the Bank should strive to keep i t s assistance strategy focused on the results
that are feasible given country conditions and IDA resource constraints. In this respect, the country
program supporting CAS outcomes needs to be especially responsive to client capabilities and
institutional and political context, while reflecting selectivity and maximizing partnerships with
development partners.

107

89.
CAS flexibility should also be reflected inthe mix o f instruments used to deliver Bank assistance.
I n the case of Bangladesh, an important lending instrument could be programmatic, increasingly
multi-sectoral budgetary support that can allow for adjustment the level of assistance to the pace of
reforms. T h i s approach, however, would demand stepped-up efforts to strengthen fiduciary systems and,
in general, better results at building institutional capacity beyond the limited number o f “islands o f
excellence.” “Good local fit” based on a thorough institutional analysis should thus be emphasized
in the near future.
90.
The above approach should translate at the project level into greater realism in project
design, completion schedules, and definition of objectives and outcomes, as well as more strategic
thinking about supervision. Increased coordination across sectors i s needed for project design and
supervision since many long-standing factors affecting project preparation and implementation involve
political, legal, and institutional issues that cannot be fully understood nor solved on a project-by-project
basis.

9 1.
The non-lending program should be planned and implemented more strategically by linking
it better to the lending program, and in general to the CAS outcomes. The CAS should consider, at
the same time, timing and linking analytical work to policy formulation processes o f the Government.
Finally, the Bank should try out other effective ways o f communication besides regular reports and

dissemination workshops.

Joint CAS Process - Progress todate
1.
Four development partners namely WB, DFID, ADB and Japan initiated a dialogue on the
preparation o f a joint Country Assistance Strategy. They gathered in a two day retreat from March 2021st, which took place in the World Bank offices in Dhaka (program attached). Over 40 staff from the
four organizations participated. The main objectives o f the retreat were to:

(iagree
) on the main partnership principles and teamwork among the four development partners
(Box. 1)
(ii)
understand each institution's processes, requirements, and timetables for the preparation o f
their country assistance strategies
(iii)
construct a consistent view o f Bangladesh's achievements and challenges on growth and
poverty as identifiedby the analytical work and the results o f the consultations with the civil
society and other focus groups
(iv) agree on the emerging themes/pillars for the strategy
(v) initiate the preparation o f a joint outcome matrix on the basis o f the agreed pillars.

2.
Dr. Kamal Siddique, the Principal Secretary to the PM, addressed the first dinner o f the retreat
and spoke about the Government priorities as outlined intheir recently prepared National Strategy for
Accelerated Poverty Reduction. Secretary ERD, Mr. Ismail Zabihullah, was also invited to attend.

3.
The retreat was successful inachieving i t s objectives and was well received by the participants
who were actively engaged throughout. The four development partners agreed on the partnership
guiding principles (Box 1). There was also broad agreement on the main issues and challenges facing
Bangladesh's efforts to achieve higher growth and reduce poverty.
4.
Improvements in the
Participants agreed on the main pillars of the strategy as being: (i)
Investment Climate for generating growth and employment, and: (ii)Empowering the Poor through
better skills, health, nutrition and transparent government, with Governance being a key constraint and
the foundation for success in both pillars . Gender also emerged as an important cross-cutting theme.
These were consistent with the CAS approach and story-line developed by the Bank inFebruary 05 at the
concept stage. Participants engaged in the preparation o f a joint outcome matrix based on the three
themes, which w i l l guide their work and the discussions with the Government on how the development
partners w i l l measure progress in the implementation o f their programs towards supporting the
Government's PRSP. Work on the outcomes continued throughout the preparation o f the CAS. The
results matrix presented in Attachment 1 to this document i s the result o f such consultations and work
among the Bank and other development partners.

5.
A second retreat with the donors took place inJuly 2005, to focus on sector specific issues as well
as instruments to deliver the strategy. The output o f these processes was the preparation o f a set o f sector
specific strategy notes covering the main priority areas, including, civil service reform, public financial
management and procurement, local governance, rural infrastructure, transport, Power, Legal and
Judicial, Agriculture, and Education. The main objective o f the second stage was to agree on a clearer
division o f responsibilities among donors and especially use this platform to involve and consult with the
rest o f the donor community. Therefore, in several o f the sectors mentioned above consultations were
held with the L C G sub-groups interested inthe sector. As a follow up to these meetings development
partners w i l l continue to cooperate and coordinate closely with the Government to ensure full support of
the PRSP.
6.

A newsletter on the joint CAS was prepared on behalf o f the four development partners.

Bangladesh: Country Financing Parameters

Parameter

RemarkdExplanation

Cost Sharing. Limit on the
proportion o f individualproject
costs that the Bank may finance.

100%

The Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f the costs o f
individual operations. Counterpart funding will be
encouraged. Cost sharing arrangements will be determined
on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the
Government’s development program and budget allocated
for the concerned sector(s), link to PRSP/CAS priorities,
the project context and impact o f the cost sharing
arrangement on project implementation and achievement o f
project outcomes, implications for the CAS envelope, and
other potential sources o f co-financing. I t i s expected that
the Bank’s f m n c i n g share could be higher, inter alia, in
community-based projects; provision o f services at the
local level, including local infrastructure; and social and
human development investments. The Bank’s financing
share may be lower in general infrastructure investments.

Recurrent Cost Financing. Any
limits that would apply to the
overall amount o f recurrent
expenhtures that the Bank may
finance.

NOcountrylevel limit

The Bank will continue to monitor the medium-term fiscal
position and prospects and its implications for recurrent
cost financing. In determining Bank financing o f recurrent
costs in individual projects, the Bank will carefully
consider sustainability issues at the sector and project
levels, including arrangements critical to operation and
maintenance (O&M) and implied future budgetary outlays.
Simultaneously, the Bank will continue to promote the
consolidation o f development and revenue budgets and
improvements in O&M allocation.

Local Costfinancing. Are the
requirements for Bank financing
o f local expenditures met,
namely that: (i)
financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would
exceed the public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation
and other revenues) and
expected domestic borrowing;
and (ii)
the financing o f foreign
cxpenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist inthe
h a n c i n g o f individualprojects.
Taxes and duties. Are there any
taxes and duties that the bank
would not finance?

Yes

The two requirements are met. The Bank may finance
local costs in the proportions needed inindividual projects.

Vone

Faxes and duties are considered reasonable and noniiscriminatory. Subject to ongoing monitoring o f the
:ountry’s tax policy, the Bank may finance taxes and duties
issociated with project expenditures. At the projectipecfic level, the Bank will consider whether taxes and
luties constitute an excessively high share o f project costs.

130

Summary Background Note
A.

Cost Sharing

1.

Presently, IDA accounts on average for about 80 percent o f total financing o f the projects in
which it i s involved. Greater flexibility in project cost financing would allow the Bank and GOB to
determine the cost-sharing ratios that best support project implementation and achievement o f project
outcomes. Accordingly, Bank financing for individual projects in Bangladesh may be up to 100
percent of project costs. To exercise the added flexibility in cost sharing, the following factors w i l l be
taken into consideration:
e

At the general level, IDA’Soverall resource envelope for Bangladesh and availability o f other
sources o f financing. If other sources o f financing are not readily available for co-financing, the
Bank may finance 100 percent o f all program / project costs, depending o f course, on sector
and project level considerations.

e

At the sector and program /project level, information on the borrower’s use o f own resources
to fund i t s development program for the sector(s) concerned. Funding from government or from
other sources w i l l be encouraged to leverage IDA resources and promote partnerships.

2.

Accordingly, the Bank will apply the following approach to cost sharing in Bangladesh: On a
yearly basis, it w i l l discuss with the Government the upcoming projects in the pipeline and agree on
tentative financing share o f project costs, which would subsequently be reflected in the Project Concept
Note (PCN) o f the specific project for further consideration. As noted above, any decision on cost
sharing w i l l consider the overall IDA allocation for Bangladesh, and the understanding that 100 percent
financing o f a given project may have an impact on the size o f future IDA credits, andor on the number
o f projects to be financed by the Bank. Importantly, at the specific project level, financing (from other
than IDA) may come from GOB, beneficiaries, third party international donors and financiers, or when
feasible, from local governments. These contributions do not need to be provided on a matching
payment-by-payment basis. The Bank will be able to finance the full amount o f specific expenditures,
rather than a pro-rata share o f all (or nearly all) project expenditures. These measures w i l l help
streamline project budget releases and payment procedures and enable to focus better on actual project
implementation and achievement o f project outcomes.

3.
The final decision on cost sharing arrangements will be done on a case-by-case basis, after
careful analysis o f the Government’s development program and budget allocated for the concerned
sector or sectors, link to PRSP priorities, and impact o f the cost sharing arrangement on project
implementation and achievement o f project outcomes. However, considering the above approach and
criteria, it i s expected that the Bank’s financing share could be higher, inter alia, in community-based
projects; provision o f services at the local level, including local infrastructure; and social and human
development investments. The Bank’s financing share may be lower in general infrastructure
investments, particularly in cases when sustainability issues are critical (see section on recurring costs).
4.
Current operations may be reviewed and retrofitted to the proposed CFPs on a case-by-case
basis. Nevertheless, this exercise, and especially changes in cost sharing arrangements, will only be
considered for projects that meet the following criteria: (i)
the ongoing project i s in the early stages o f
implementation, and the effort to apply the proposed CFPs retroactively w i l l have a demonstrable
impact on project implementation and achievement o f project outcomes; (ii)
the project ratings are

131

satisfactory; and (iii)
country ownership i s considered to be strong, as demonstrated through
commitment and dedication to project monitoring and implementation.

B.

Recurrent Costs

5.
Often starting from 100 percent, the Bank has been financing recurrent costs on a declining
scale in most projects in Bangladesh, and particularly in sectors such as education, health and
agriculture. Infact, in some projects, 100 percent o f recurrent costs, which usually include incremental
operational costs and project management, have been financed for several years. On the other hand, the
Bank has not financed this type o f expenditures under infrastructure projects, with the exception o f
rural roads projects where financial support has been extended to up to 60 percent o f eligible
rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures.

6.
Bangladesh’s overall fiscal and debt situation and prospects are considered reasonable, and
financing recurrent costs on a steady basis w i l l not likely affect this situation. Moreover, according to
OED reports, most Bank-financed projects in Bangladesh have had between modest to reasonable
sustainability prospects, although the country’s performance int h i s respect has recently been below the
regional and Bankwide averages’. Some o f the main factors affecting sustainability have been lack o f
medium term perspective in budget formulation and the fragmentation o f recurrent and capital budget
planning processes. These issues, however, are being addressed through the ongoing effort to
strengthen budget preparation and implementation, and to develop the MTBF.
7.
Sustainability has also been affected by the fact that public expenditures on operations and
maintenance (O&M) have tended to be inadequate. Partly because donor assistance i s concentrated on
the ADP, the government has leaned towards new investments without fully understanding the
implications for recurrent expenditures.* The ongoing support to improve public expenditure
management i s thus focusing on identifymg mechanisms to secure adequate resource allocation o f nonwage O&M expenditures in critical sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure. In addition to
inadequate funding, this effort i s looking at options for addressing chronic problems with O&M, such
as overextension o f infkastructure and service networks in relation to financial and institutional
capacity, weak bureaucratic incentives to budget and spend on this critical item, inappropriate mix
between the wage bill and non-wage O&M, and weak cost recovery.
8.
Within the framework o f the current efforts to improve public expenditure management, no
specific limit i s proposed for the financing of recurrent costs in individual operations.
Accordingly, the level o f recurrent cost financing w i l l be decided by carefully considering sustainability
issues at the sector and project levels, including implied future budgetary outlays and progress made in
addressing O&M issues. When deciding, the Bank w i l l also seek to exploit opportunities to encourage
early transfer o f recurrent costs to the Revenue Budget. The type o f recurrent costs to be financed
would cover areas such as operational costs and project management, in addition to other areas
consistent with sustainability o f investments, and in the long term, o f project outcomes. In addition to
close attention to progress made on budget consolidation and O&M resource allocation, the Bank w i l l
continue to monitor the aggregate fiscal position and prospects and its implications for recurrent cost
financing.

In the case o f Bangladesh, sustainability o f project benefits was considered likely for 63 percent o f the 18
projects evaluated by OED between FYOO and FY04. The region’s and Bank’s shares were 8 1 percent and 73
percent, respectively.
Operations and maintenance(O&M) expendituresrepresented a comparatively low 0.5 percent o f GDP in FY04.

132

C.

Local Cost Financing

9.
The Bank may finance local expenditure for projects when it i s satisfied that: (a) financing
requirements for the development program o f the country where the project i s located would exceed the
public sector’s own resources and expected domestic borrowing; and (b) the financing o f foreign
expenditures alone would not enable the Bank to assist in the financing o f such projects.
10.
InBangladesh, the Bank has been financing shares o f total local project cost ranging from 50
percent inthe rural roads sub-sector to 80 percent in the social sectors. Overall, local expenses comprise
a significant proportion o f project expenses in the country, and Bank financial support for these local
costs i s critical to the viability o f many projects. Specifically, about 69 percent o f total disbursements
between FY99 and FY04, and 81 percent between FY02 and FY04, were for local expenditures. T h i s
trend i s expected to continue in future for projects in the portfolio and pipeline. Moreover, the financing
requirements for Bangladesh’s development program substantially exceed the public sector’s own
resources, and likely more so when implementation o f the PRSP reaches full steam. Presently,
Bangladesh faces a financing gap with respect to development programs o f about 2.5 percent o f GDP,
within the constraints o f the macro-framework agreed with the Fund and the Bank. Despite renewed
efforts, Government revenues from tax and non-tax sources remain comparatively low, which further
l i m i t s the public sector’s capacity to meet development needs.3
11.
The two criteria for Bank financing o f local costs are met, and it i s proposed that foreign and
local expenditures be treated in the same way with regard to Bank financing. Therefore, the Bank may
finance local (and foreign) costs in any proportion needed in individual projects. T h i s approach
should provide greater flexibility and reduce administrative burden inIDA-financed projects.

D.

Financing Taxes and Duties

12.
Bangladesh has a well defined tax policy and parameters with a broad-based VAT,
supplemented by luxury taxes and an income tax. The National Board o f Revenue (NBR) i s the apex
tax authority in the country, collecting over 90 percent o f total taxes. The NBR portion o f total taxes
includes customs duty, Value Added Tax (VAT), supplementary duty (SD), income tax, foreign travel
tax, electricity duty, wealth tax, advertisement tax, gift tax and miscellaneous insignificant taxes. The
‘non-NBR portion’ o f taxes includes narcotics duty, land revenue, non-judicial stamp, registration fee
and motor vehicle tax. Direct taxes represent a low share o f total taxes, which makes the tax structure
heavily dependent on indirect taxes. The major taxes are customs duty, VAT, SD and income tax.
13.
Overall rates o f the taxes with implications for Bank financing are relatively m ~ d e r a t eVAT
.~ is
15 percent. Income tax rates range from 10 to 25 p e r ~ e n tThe
. ~ corporate tax rate ranges between 35 and
40 percent, depending on whether the company has publicly-traded shares or not. Incomes from small
and cottage industries are given a 5 to 10 percent tax rebate depending on the production volume. Tax
holidays for a period o f 5 to 7 years, depending on the location, are given to newly established business
enterprises. Some strategic investment goods are exempt from VAT and import duties.

At about 9 percent, the Revenue to GDP ratio remains quite low by international standards.
- ~ . o r ~ l a ~
Up-to-date and detailed information on taxes and duties in Bangladesh can be found at ~ ~ ~ l l ~ . n ~ (the
website o f the National Board o f Revenue).
The specific slabs o f income tax rate are: On the f i r s t Tk. 120,000 o f total income, 0 percent; on the next Tk. 250,000, 10
percent; on the next 300,000, 15 percent; on the next Tk. 350,000,20 percent, and on the balance o f total income, 25 percent.
Minimum tax payable i s Tk 1,800.

133

14.
Trade liberalization has been advanced with a reduction in and rationalization o f customs
duties. Accordingly, the average rate o f customs duty was lowered from 21 percent in FYOl to 15.4
percent in the FY06 budget, while the top rate was lowered from 37.5 percent to 25 percent. The
number o f non-zero custom tariff rates was reduced from four to three. Custom duties range from 7.5 to
30 percent, and the average custom duty rate i s about 14 percent. Supplementary Duties (SDs) are
mainly levied on only-imported products (e.g., imports o f textiles), with rates ranging from 15 to 35
percent. A few f i s h products have SD rates o f 40 percent, and rates o f certain products that are
considered as having potential harmful effects on the environment or health have been kept relatively
high.6In general, however, the SD rate on imports averages 30 percent. In contrast, duties and other
charges on motor vehicles imports can, in certain cases, reach high level^.^ Nonetheless, this i s not
expected to have a substantial impact on Bank financing, since Bank-supported projects do not
normally include procurement o f a considerable number o f vehicles. Importantly, close attention w i l l be
paid to this issue when deciding cost sharing percentages.
15.
Overall, there i s no differential tax treatment in the tax structure that could impact Bankfinanced projects. Currently, the tax and duty incidence on goods and works fnanced by the Bank in
Bangladesh i s about 20 percent. The Bank has been financing 100 percent o f foreign expenditures on
equipment goods and materials, as well as 100 percent o f local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 70-80
percent o f other items procured locally.

16.
In brief, there are no taxes or duties that have been identified as unreasonable or discriminatory.
Under these circumstances, the Bank may finance taxes and duties associated with project
expenditures. The application o f this general approach w i l l be subject to ongoing monitoring o f
Bangladesh’s tax policy and i t s implementation in Bank projects. At the project-level, the Bank would
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f projects costs.

Products with high SDs include, inter alia, cigars and cigarettes (90 percent); cocoa and chocolate (60 percent); beer (250
percent); and hard liquor and food containing alcohol exceeding 0.5 percent by volume (350 percent). These SDs, however,
have no incidence on Bank-financed projects.
