PERU
Country Partnership Strategy
Fiscal Years 2007-2011
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Peru faces a promising future. For the first time in i t s recent history, Peru experienced a
democratic political transition in the midst o f a period o f sustained economic growth. The former
administration focused successfully on disciplined fiscal and monetary policies and now the country has a
solid foundation on which to accelerate growth and offer greater opportunities for Peruvians to improve
their lives. However, there are many problems that remain. One in two Peruvians i s poor, and poverty i s
declining more slowly than expected given the rate o f growth. Infrastructure i s deficient. The quality of
social services i s low, despite good, coverage rates. Although there are some islands o f excellence within
the public sector, state institutions are generally held in low esteem by the public. And while the
economy has performed well over the past several years, i t has not yet been strongly tested by negative
shocks. There i s s t i l l a need to reduce vulnerabilities to ensure that the country does not revert to the
pattern o f ups and downs that has characterized the past thirty years.

The new administration i s working to address these weaknesses, while simultaneously building
on the successes o f the recent past. The new government’s key challenge w i l l be to consolidate economic
expansion while being able to provide the f r u i t s o f growth to poorer segments o f the population. There i s
certainly an urgent need to meet this challenge. The results o f the last elections clearly indicated that,
despite overall sustained growth, a significant percentage o f the population did not feel the benefits of that
growth. The government proposes to devote equal attention to economic and human development, to
promote greater social justice and a better standard o f living. The government w i l l have to balance the
need to maintain macro stability, while increasing the institutional capacity o f the state and strengthening
the country’s physical and social infrastructure. At the same time, the new administration intends to play
the role o f promoter and regulator o f private sector-led growth, continuing to facilitate greater integration
to the global economy. The government recognizes that while attaining the right balance i s difficult when
external conditions are favorable, it i s more difficult to strike an appropriate balance if external conditions
become less favorable. For this reason, the government i s devoting a considerable effort today to reduce
vulnerabilities to potential domestic and external shocks.
The World Bank Group (WBG) intends to support the new administration and help achieve i t s
aims, particularly in the areas o f poverty reduction, inequality and governance. This Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) describes the proposed support for the five-year period o f the new government,
corresponding to the Bank’s fiscal years 2007-1 1. The CPS i s being prepared at a time when there has
been strong country performance over the last four years, a striking commonality in the development
visions of the government and the WBG, and a close working relation that has rapidly evolved with the
new administration and, indeed, with many o f the key stakeholders in the country. I t has been prepared
keeping in mind the key elements o f the recent WBG strategy on Middle Income Countries. As such, this
CPS provides greater flexibility to the government than has been the case w i t h previous Country
Assistance Strategies, in keeping with Peru’s status as a rapidly-developing middle-income country. The
flexibility i s evident in the amounts o f financing to be provided and the content and timing o f different
lending operations.
The results of the consultation process as well as the lessons learned obtained from the CAS
Completion Report provided additional feedback on how the WBG could provide innovations to the
proposed program. Over the CPS period, there w i l l be further work to ensure that the recent innovations

in IBRD banking products are used to optimize not only the debt portfolio that the country holds w i t h the
Bank, but i t s overall debt portfolio with all creditors. Also, this strategy presents an increased emphasis
on strategic communication and on the replication o f good practices, building upon the successes in Peru
in recent years. Finally, there i s a strong focus on results. The Government o f Peru has a strong interest
in improving the results orientation o f i t s public expenditures and this CPS introduces several new
elements to advance the results agenda, over and above the presentation o f a Results Matrix for CPS
activities.

The CPS demonstrates greater synergy among the work o f different members o f the WBG,
particularly between IBRD and IFC. The IBRD and the IFC have focused their collaboration on a few
specific areas, such as linking urban property rights on the IBRD side and micro finance o n the IFC side.
The grouping o f lending, AAA and IFC investments within thematic clusters provides a useful way for
the two branches o f the WBG to enhance the interaction between the public and the private sectors in
Peru so as to achieve results, IFC’s strategy w i l l involve balancing i t s support among large companies
and MSMEs, and between investment and technical assistance. The IFC will: (i)
work to reduce Peru’s
high informality with technical assistance; (ii)invest and develop projects which address bottlenecks to
provision o f basic services and physical infrastructure; (iii)
invest in industries w i t h strong competitive
advantages such as agribusiness and tourism; (iv) expand growth to new beneficiaries by providing access
to MSMEs, housing, and tertiary education finance and by building local government capacity to deliver
services; and (v) support environmentally and socially sustainable growth (natural resources sector).
While the overall outlook i s positive, Peru does face several risks. One o f the most important
risks i s social. I f the underlying factors that led to the social discontent manifested in the last election are
not addressed quickly, there could be increased social conflict. There can also be social conflict triggered
by groups interested in a single issue-coca or mining, for example. Whatever the source o f social
conflict, there i s a risk o f entering a vicious circle. Social conflict would lead to lower private investment
which, in turn, would lower growth and imply that there would be fewer resources to address the social
concerns. O n the same order of magnitude as the social risks are the external risks. A similar vicious
circle could be generated by an external shock in the form o f a dramatic reduction in commodity prices or
a strong El Niiio effect. Additionally, Peru i s considered to be among the strongest candidates to suffer
the effects of climate change in the near future. Another external risk i s a possible delay (or even outright
rejection) o f the FTA by the U S Congress.
W i t h continued strong policy and key reforms, these risks can be mitigated and the country could
be on a development path similar to other successful cases in the region, leaving behind a Peru that i s
richer, more equitable and more governable. The next three to four years w i l l be critical to achieve these
goals. Ifthe poor see signs that there i s a serious effort to address their problems and that the state has the
capability to deliver results, the more promising future could come to pass. However, if there i s no
significant progress over this period, Peru could become less governable and the temptation will be great
to revert to the type o f policies that gave rise to the problems o f the past.
Ouestions for the Board
D o Executive Directors consider the inclusion o f the Bank’s M I C strategy in this CPS (flexible indicative
menu-based lending and AAA program, credit risk management through exposure limits, results focus,
use o f innovative financial products and strategic communication) as an adequate strategic response to the
operational requirements o f a sophisticated middle-income country like Peru?

COUNTRYDIAGNOSIS

Political, Social and Economic Context

4.
President Alan Garcia o f the APRA party took office on July 28 o f this year after winning a
second-round runoff election with 54 percent o f the vote. The election results revealed a marked split
across the country, w i t h President Garcia winning in Lima and in the north, but losing the vote in the
highlands and the Amazon region to the rival candidate Ollanta Humala in what was widely perceived as

a reflection o f dissatisfaction with the traditional political system. President Garcia has signaled that
responding to this dissatisfaction w i l l be one o f the centerpieces o f his government’s medium-term plan.
5.
President Garcia faces a fragmented Congress, which w i l l require building coalitions to pass
legislation. His APRA party has 37 seats, compared to 44 for Humala’s alliance (PNP-UPP) and 39
divided among five other parties. PNP-UPP has said it will strongly defend their candidate’s platform,
meaning i t w i l l likely form the core of opposition to Garcia’s agenda, requiring APRA to seek coalitions
with the other parties. Garcia’s cabinet i s a m i x o f APRA members and well-respected technocrats, w i t h a
record six women in ministerial posts. The latest p o l l numbers show Garcia’s public support between 60
and 70 percent.
6.
The new administration inherited a stable macroeconomic situation from the previous
government-the
result o f sound economic policies and a favorable external environment (Table 1).
Among the impressive achievements o f recent years are: a) growth greater than 4 percent in each o f the
last four years; b) growth and diversification o f exports (up 35 percent from 2004 to 2005); c) reduction in
country risk (down 21 percent from 2004 to 2005); d) Stronger tax collection effort (up 14 percent from
2004 to 2005); and projected fiscal surplus for 2006 (expected to be between 0.2 and 0.6 percent o f GDP).

Growth has been well-balanced between primary and non-primary sectors, and has been
particularly strong in agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and mining. Unlike previous decades,
growth has reached non-traditional sectors beyond commodities, has been led by rapidly-growing exports,
and has been accompanied by improvements in productivity. Moreover, the economy grew despite
recurrent internal political instability in 2003 and 2004. While many developing countries have been
doing well recently, Peru has been doing particularly well, growing 6.4 percent in 2005, above the Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC) average (5.6 percent). In 2005, Peru was among the four highest
performers in the region.

8.
Although mining production accounts for over half o f all Peruvian exports, non-traditional
exports have grown rapidly, 20 percent on average annually since 2000, particularly in specialized
agricultural products such as asparagus, grapes and avocados. Other export sectors such as fisheries and
textiles have also posted significant gains in recent years. Private investment, encouraged by the growing
economy and sound policies, has also helped fuel growth, rising nearly 14 percent in real terms during
2005 (15.7% o f GDP).

2

9.
Monetary and fiscal policies have been managed prudently. The 2005 year-end inflation rate was
1.5 percent, at the l o w end o f the target range o f 1.5-3.5 percent. High world o i l prices have not affected
Peru’s inflation partly because of fiscal policies such as excise tax reductions and the use o f a stabilization
fund. The combination o f fiscal discipline and a favorable external environment supported a significant
decline in the budget deficit during the past administration. In 2005, the overall deficit o f the nonfinancial public sector fell from 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 0.3 percent o f GDP. In 2006, fiscal
consolidation has continued, with the non-financial public sector expected to report a surplus of 0.6-0.8
percent o f GDP, only the second budget surplus in 40 years. However, much o f the decline in the fiscal
deficit has occurred through a reduction in public investment, while current expenditures increased.
Improvements in broadening the tax base and increasing collections are s t i l l needed.
10.
Declining public external debt and prudent debt management have reduced solvency and liquidity
vulnerabilities, and led rating agencies to upgrade Peru’s sovereign rating, bringing i t closer to investment
grade.’ Both the country’s debt service profile and i t s currency and interest risks have improved
significantly. The ratio o f public debt to GDP decreased from 46.9 percent in 2002 to a projected 32
percent in 2006, o f which 24 percent corresponds to foreign public debt.

B.

Poverty and Inequality

11.
Despite recent strong growth, there has been limited progress in poverty and inequality (Table 2).
The national poverty rate declined only from 54 to 51.6 percent between 2001 and 2004, the most recent
year for which poverty rates are available. However, the economic recovery since 2001 has had a strong
positive impact in reducing extreme poverty (from 24.4 percent in 2001 to 19.2 percent in 2004). Poverty
levels are significantly higher in rural areas, particularly the Sierra region (67.7 percent), while urban
areas-most notably Metropolitan Lima-are
the most unequal. Inequality, measured by the Gini
coefficient, stood at 0.43-below
the Latin American average o f 0.52, but s t i l l high by international
standards.

Standard and Poor’s upgraded Peru’s long-term foreign currency ratings to BB in June 2004 and i t s long-term
local currency rating to BBB- in N o v . 2006. At end August 2006, Fitch raised Peru to BB+, the first adjustment
by this agency since 2004. With this upgrade, Peru i s one step away from investment grade.

12.
The slow reaction o f poverty to economic growth i s explained by three principal reasons:* First,
growth in recent years has been driven principally by capital-intensive industries, particularly commodity
extraction, w i t h a l o w demand for labor and hence a lower direct impact on poverty. The steady growth
o f non-traditional exports w i l l help change this imbalance over the medium term. Second, the growth of
2001 and 2002 represented a rebound from the economic downturn in 1999 and 2000, meaning significant
excess installed capacity existed, limiting greater j o b creation. That excess capacity i s now being worked
out, and recent indicators o f job creation in urban areas (increases o f 5 percent per month or more in the
first half o f 2006) suggest poverty rates may well have dropped hrther since 2004. Third, growth has
historically been very volatile in Peru and this has made it difficult to reduce poverty. Taking the last ten
years o f illustrative o f the problem, from 1994 to 1997 there was a solid poverty reduction o f 4.5
percentage points. The crisis o f the late 1990’s reversed the trend and poverty increased rapidly by 5.7
points between 1997 and 2000. With the recovery, poverty levels have started to go in the right direction
again, but progress has been slow with a reduction o f only 1.2 points between 2000 and 2004. The net
result i s that Peru had exactly the same level o f poverty in 2004 as it had ten years earlier. The volatility
over the last 10 years i s even more pronounced over the last 30 years, with per capita income levels only
now returning to the levels o f the 1970s. The recent years o f sound, sustainable economic policy and
continuity through a peaceful democratic transition auger well for Peru’s ability to put volatility behind
and broaden the impact o f economic growth on poverty reduction.

13.
The national poverty rate masks important differences across urban and rural areas and across
regions. While poverty rose between 1997 and 2000 in both urban and rural areas, i t remained stable in
the former but declined in the latter between 200 1 and 2003. Similarly, after generalized increases across
regions due to the crisis, poverty continued to worsen slightly in Lima, while i t improved in the Selva and
remained stable in the rest o f the country. Extreme poverty remained stable in 1997-2000, and improved
steadily in 2001-2004, especially in the poorest rural departments. Significant improvements can also be
seen in the poverty gap and severity during this period, which declined from 20.9 to 18.5 and from 10.7 to
8.9, respectively, during 2001 -2004. Rural poverty rates are significantly higher among those employed in
the agricultural sector (80 percent) than among those empioyed in the non-agricultural sector (60 percent).
Most of the variation in rural household income i s explained by variation in non-agricultural income from
salaried employment. Furthermore, the share o f agricultural income declines as total income increases.
Roughly half of all rural households obtain all income from self-employment in the agricultural sector,
while the rest combine agriculture with other types o f work.
14.
Ethnicity forms another aspect o f the reality o f poverty in Peru. The number o f indigenous in the
country i s a matter o f debate, with estimates ranging between one-quarter and one-half of the population,
depending on the definition used. However these groups are defined, it i s clear that they are much more
likely to live in conditions o f poverty than the rest o f the population. O n a national level, 64 percent o f
indigenous peoples live below the poverty line, while nearly 80 percent o f the rural indigenous population
i s poor, compared to 40 percent and 66 percent to non-indigenous, re~pectively.~
15.
Access to public services such as health care, education, and social protection i s l o w among the
poor, indigenous groups, and in rural areas. The poor are also less likely than the non-poor to come in
contact with various public institutions, ranging from central and local government offices to public banks
and the judiciary system. L o w productivity, low income levels and limited economic opportunities and

For more details, refer to the Peru Poverty Assessment (2005). A fourth possible explanation i s that, as INEI
shifted to a continuous household survey in 2003. there m a y have been some underreporting o n consumption
expenditures in Metropolitan Lima. The consumption data are currently being reviewed by INEI, with the help
o f the W o r l d Bank.

access to public services are not the only barriers the poor must surpass. Restricted capacity to hedge
against risk through income diversification and to save makes the poor more vulnerable to shocks.

C.

Economic Prospects in the Medium Term

16.
Peru’s medium-term outlook i s favorable. Economic activity has remained strong during 2006, in
spite o f presidential elections, and i s likely to remain strong over 2007. The strength o f trade accounts
has allowed Peru to marshal a strong international reserve position: net foreign reserves are equivalent to
more than 280 percent o f emergency debt and more than one year worth o f imports. Real GDP i s
projected to grow at an average o f 5.5 percent during the period 2006-09. Peru’s growth prospects could
be affected by existing global imbalances and a potential deterioration o f commodity prices, but growth
estimates appear sufficiently robust to accommodate potential shocks.
17.
Consolidation o f Peru’s medium-term fiscal stance relies o n external financing and on tax reform,
as the latter i s needed to expand fiscal space. Assuming compliance with the fiscal deficit targets o f the
Fiscal Responsibility L a w (FTRL) and the above-mentioned growth estimates, Peru’s financing needs
between 2006 and 2009 are approximately US$8.6 billion. Projected external financing represent 55
percent (US$4.7 billion) of total needs, o f which US$1.8 billion i s expected to be budget support. Debt
management has been modernized, reflected in the publication early in 2006 o f the government debt
management strategy. Peru i s one the few countries in Latin America that have formalized the strategy,
greatly enhancing the transparency and accountability. The debt management strategy aims to mitigate
refinancing risk,.increase the share of domestic debt in soles, lengthen the maturity o f fixed-rate debt, and
continue to develop the market for international sovereign bonds. The medium-term plan i s to reduce the
ratio o f public debt to 26 percent o f GDP at the end o f 201 1, which coincides with Bank projections, and
to reduce foreign currency participation to 69 percent (from 74 percent in 2005).
Tax revenue collection o f the central government increased from 12.5 percent o f GDP in 2001 to
18.
13.6 percent o f GDP in 2005, but i s s t i l l l o w by international standards and well below the 18 percent o f
GDP o f the mid-1990s. This i s mainly due to a narrow tax base because tax rates are high (1 9 percent
VAT and 30 percent income tax). The recent improvement in the tax ratio has been due to rapid
economic growth, revenue windfall from a sharp rise in the price o f commodities, and the implementation
o f new tax measures. Tax revenue i s projected to reach 15 percent o f GDP in 2006, which i s a good sign.
However, there are some concerns about how lasting these improvements will be. A closer look to the
composition of the gains in tax revenue collection show that these are mostly transitory in nature: twothirds of the gains are due to higher corporate taxes from mining companies. The high exposure o f Peru’s
revenue to commodity cycles raises the question o f sustainability o f the observed strong fiscal finances.
Second, the gains from policy measures are mostly due to hikes in tax rates rather than from a broadening
of the tax base. An additional problem i s that the tax base i s currently limited by the existence o f
regional and sectoral exemptions, which are estimated to amount to 1.9 percent o f GDP.

19.
The growth rate o f non-traditional exports w i l l face some risks if the Free Trade Agreement
(FTA) with the United Sates i s not approved before the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication
Act (ATPDEA) expires in December 2006. The FTA with the US was recently approved by the Peruvian
Congress. So far, the new government has been lobbying to get the approval by the U S Congress but i t i s
not clear yet when the FTA would be approved. The U S government has requested that Congress extend
A T P D E A for another year in the event that the FTA i s not ratified by the end o f 2006.
The IMF Executive Board recently completed the fourth and fifth reviews under Peru’s 26-month
20.
Stand-By Arrangement, in an amount equivalent to SDR 287 million (about US$424 million), approved
o n June 9, 2004. The completion o f the final reviews makes available the full amount o f the arrangement.
The Peruvian authorities have treated the arrangement as precautionary and did not make any drawings
before the arrangement expired on August 16, 2006. Discussions for the 2006 Article I V Consultation
and Negotiations for a new Stand-By Arrangement started in October 2006 at the request o f the Peruvian

5

authorities. This arrangement, as with the previous one, i s likely to be treated as precautionary. A
renewal o f a program w i t h the IMF together with this proposed development policy loan will bolster
market confidence at the early stage o f the new government.
21.
In the near future, the possibility o f natural disasters and, specifically, the likelihood o f another El
Nin’o phenomenon have generated some concern in the government. El Nifio, a natural event that recurs
every five to seven years, usually results in abnormally high rainfall levels in the north and severe
droughts in the south o f Peru. During 1982-83 the calculated economic and structural losses from El
N i i i o were estimated to be US$3.28 billion, or about 6.2 percent o f 1983 GDP; and US$3.5 billion, or
roughly 3 percent o f 1998 GDP in 1997-98. In the medium term, the possibility o f adverse effects of
climate change i s a concern. Particularly important are the effects o f global warming o n the size o f the
glaciers in the Andes as these provide an important source o f water for irrigation, electricity generation
and human consumption in the coastal areas.
22.
Social tensions have been an issue in isolated areas related to natural resource extraction, and the
government i s taking actions to address these problems. The new administration has for the first time
created a Conflicts Unit in the Presidential Council o f Ministers, a high-level office for negotiating
conflicts as they arise. The unit works hand-in-hand with the Defensoria del Pueblo (Human Rights
Ombudsman) to create a space for dialogue with disaffected groups. The work o f IFC’s Technical
Assistance Facility on improving the use o f mining canon around the Yanacocha gold mine has also been
successful in illustrating how the industry can benefit local communities.
111.

A SHAREDVISION

23.
To a large extent, the visions o f the government and that o f the World Bank Group coincide, on
both broader goals as well as key obstacles and reforms needed to achieve those goals.4 The twin
overriding objectives are to sustain and accelerate economic growth and to ensure that there i s a more
rapid reduction o f poverty, The government proposes to devote equal attention to economic and human
development, to promote greater social justice, inclusion and a better standard o f living. Many o f i t s
social policies are directed towards addressing not only poverty, but extreme poverty. The government
will have to balance the need to maintain macro stability, while increasing the institutional capacity o f the
state and strengthening the country’s physical and social infrastructure. The government intends to play
the role o f promoter and regulator o f private sector-led growth, continuing to facilitate greater integration
to the global economy. The government recognizes that while attaining the right balance i s difficult when
external conditions are favorable, i t i s more difficult to strike an appropriate balance if external conditions
become less favorable. For this reason, the government i s working during the good years to reduce
vulnerabilities to potential domestic and external shocks.
24.
There i s widespread consensus within the country that the two main over-arching results that the
country should try to achieve are sustained and higher economic growth and significant poverty
reduction. Preparatory work done by the Bank, researching growth and poverty performance historically
around the world and taking into account the conditions o f Peru, indicate that ambitious but achievable
targets for the five year CPS period are: a) to achieve sustained growth over 5 percent each year over the
period 2007-1 l;5
and b) to achieve a rate o f poverty reduction o f between 1.5 and 1.8 points per year.6
4

The GOP vision i s expressed in the Prime Minister’s presentation o f the government plan in Congress. The WBG
vision i s expressed in a series o f Policy Notes, recently published in Spanish, entitled: An Opportunity for a
Different Peru: M o r e Prosperous, Equitable and Governable.
5
Achieving these growth targets would ensure that Peru would have 10 years o f growth equal to or greater than 4
percent each year. Only 5 percent o f all 10 year periods o f 188 countries over the last 40 years have been
characterized by this type o f sustained growth.

6

25.
Beyond the overarching objectives are a set o f more narrowly defined objectives that are
important in their o w n right and because they contribute to sustaining and accelerating growth and
increasing the rate o f poverty reduction. These additional objectives can be organized into three pillars
that form the foundation both for the 2007-11 Government Plan and the WBG country vision, as
expressed under this CPS and which are based on the set o f 36 Policy Notes recently presented to the
government. These three pillars are: (i)Economic Growth; (ii)Social Development; and (iii)
Modernization o f the State.
A.

Economic Growth

26.
Over the next five years, the challenges w i l l be to maintain macro stability and reduce
vulnerabilities; accelerate the rate o f growth and widen i t s base; and make i t environmentally sustainable.
27.
Maintaining macro stability and reducing vulnerabilities. Although the macroeconomic
panorama has been stable in recent years, i t should be strengthened to further reduce vulnerabilities. On
the fiscal side, the public sector needs reforms in two areas: the tax system and public expenditures.
Peru’s tax rates are comparatively higher than the region’s average while tax collection i s l o w . K e y
difficulties include high levels o f informality and non-compliance and proliferation o f tax exemptions.
Eliminating tax exonerations has proven to be very difficult politically and while the government i s
committed to this, i t will be pursuing a policy o f gradualism. This implies that, over the CPS period, the
government w i l l have to try to meet all o f i t s development goals w i t h tax revenue that i s unlikely to be
more than 16 percent o f GDP. Provided that growth continues and the government i s able to curtail the
growth o f current expenditures, there should be considerable increases in the absolute amount o f funds
available.’ However, if the external environment changes, tax revenues could fall rapidly and the
availability o f resources could become, once again, a severe limitation.
28.
O n the monetary side, Peru’s i s a highly dollarized economy w i t h three quarters o f outstanding
bank loans denominated in U S dollars while most personal and corporate income i s in soles. In the longrun, Peru’s monetary policy credibility and sound macroeconomic framework should keep o n reducing
dollarization. L o w inflation and l o w exchange rate volatility are not necessarily compatible, and
complementary policies are needed (such as housing financing programs in local currency).
29.
Peru i s one o f the fifty most vulnerable countries to natural disasters (World Bank’s H o t Spots
Study), notably because o f its exposure to earthquakes and to the El N i i i o phenomenon. Natural disasters
have had historically a profound negative impact o n Peru’s social and economic development. Poorly
planned infrastructure and environmental management have exacerbated the negative impacts o f natural
occurring events and have resulted in growing vulnerabilities. Improved coordination o f urban and
regional development with hazard and risk management practices would help mitigate the negative
impacts o f natural events on social and economic development.
30.
Accelerating growth and widening its base. Assuming that the macroeconomic framework i s
properly consolidated, the country should in the medium-term aim to grow faster than its current rate o f
5-6 percent per year. A new plateau o f 8-9 percent per year, similar to that o f the East Asian countries,
could conceivably be established. Reaching this plateau w i l l depend crucially o n Peru’s capacity to
become globally competitive. A t the moment, the country ranks 68th out o f 117 in the 2005
A reduction o f 1.5 points per year would match the achievements in Peru between 1994 and 1997. A reduction o f
1.8 points would place Peru in the 75th percentile o f performance in the rate o f poverty reduction, based on a
review o f data on rates o f change o f poverty taken from 110 WB poverty assessments conducted over the last 20
years.
7
. The recent increase in tax revenue from 13.1 percent in 2004 to 13.6 percent o f GDP in 2005 (coupled with the
strong growth) resulted in an absolute increase in just one year o f 4.4 bn Nuevo Soles. This i s relatively large
compared to the total public investment budget o f some 7.5 bn Nuevo Soles. For 2006, tax revenue i s likely to jump
to 15 percent o f GDP and the projected GDP growth rate i s hovering around 7 percent.

7

Competitiveness Index o f the World Economic Forum, the key binding constraints being market access,
business environment, physical infrastructure, and technological quality. Accelerating growth w i l l also
require a continued strong performance in extractive industries.
Certainly, if the economy i s able to reach and sustain a growth plateau o f 8 to 9 percent, this
3 1.
should help produce some poverty reduction. However, the recent slow reduction in poverty with growth
that was observed between 2001 and 2004 suggests that there should be a special effort to widen the base
o f growth so as to better reach the poor. There are four main priorities to widen economic growth:
extending infrastructure to rural areas w i t h the highest concentrations o f poverty; improving access to
microfinance; changing the incentives behind informality and making the labor code more flexible; and
expanding the reach o f labor-intensive sectors such as the “new agriculture” and tourism.
32.
Market Access and Trade. Peru remains a relatively clo8ed economy. Exports and imports are
not much higher today than they were thirty years ago (about 40 percent), and Peru’s commercial
penetration in the world trade has fallen sharply: its exports now account for about 0.1 percent of world
exports, compared with 0.3 in 1970. Expanding trade l i n k s with the rest o f the world i s a priority for
accelerating growth. Apart from the U S FTA, which awaits ratification by the U S Congress, Peru has
progressed on bilateral negotiation with Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, and with the European Union
through the Andean Community (CAN).
Business environment. The private sector continues to face several constraints that must to be
33.
addressed if Peru i s to accelerate growth. Doing Business 2007 (DB) data ranks Peru poorly concerning
contract enforcement, starting a business, dealing with licenses and trading across borders. The cost for
enforcing a contract i s equivalent to 35 percent o f the debt (twice as much as in Argentina and Chile), and
i t takes 201 days to deal with licenses (40 percent more than in Mexico). The tax burden and labor
regulations are among the most cumbersome in the world: 135‘h and 158‘”, respectively, out o f 175
countries, according to DB.

34.
Physical Znfrastructzive. The government invests less than 1 percent o f GDP in public
infrastructure, with little participation o f the private sector. To maintain the current rates o f growth the
country needs to invest between 3 and 4 percent o f GDP per year in infrastructure from public and private
sources for the next 20 years. The infrastructure deficit spans almost a l l sectors, and i s particularly severe
in transport, electricity and water. Even with a renewed emphasis on containing current expenditures and
increasing the tax basis to open fiscal space for additional infrastructure spending, Peru w i l l need to
leverage scarce public funds to mobilize private investment under public-private partnerships (PPPs)
wherever possible and target purely public investments to those areas and sectors where private
investment i s most difficult to attract. Roads w i l l be a priority for the new administration, w i t h plans to
nearly double the percentage o f roads in good condition (from 25 to 45 percent) and to double the size of
the road network,
35.
Technological Capacity. Except for a few extractive industries, Peru’s technology standardsand, thus, i t s productivity-are low. This i s the result, in large part, to the l o w quality o f its tertiary
education system and the relatively small number o f technology specialists. Most knowledge transfer
comes from imports o f machinery and equipment. Only a small (albeit growing) portion o f local f i r m s
acquire technology through licensing, turnkey projects or technical specifications embedded in export
contracts. As part of i t s national export strategy the government has launched various initiatives to raise
technological standards in specific sectors such as textiles, jewelry, aquaculture, and fisheries. However,
the scale and impact have been limited thus far, and upgrading i s needed.
36.
Extractive Industries. Extractive industries are major contributors to the creation o f national
wealth, exports and fiscal revenues in Peru. Mining alone accounted for over 6% o f GDP and more than
10% of internal tax revenue in the country last year. Minerals exports earned over 9.7 billion dollars last
year, 40% higher than 2004. The value of metals and minerals production this year i s expected to be 20%
higher than last (around 10.7 billion dollars), due to record prices for copper, gold and zinc. Looking

8

forward, Peru's mining, petroleum and energy lobby association estimates that Peru could attract 10
billion dollars in mining investment in the next decade in 276 projects. However before this can happen
key issues need to be addressed: establishing a stable and predictable regulatory environment
(concessions, tax), ensure sound social and environmental practices for a sustainable development
(notably w i t h respect to local communities), and having a transparent and efficient mechanism for
allocating the benefits to all Peruvians (the Government recently agreed to j o i n the EITI as a way to show
transparency in the mining sector). About half o f these fiscal revenues are devolved by the national to
local governments through a mechanism called the Mining, O i l and Gas Canons. Municipal revenues
from tax sharing under the Mining canon have multiplied over the last years, exceeding $500m in 2005,
as a direct result o f the expansion and increasing profitability o f mining operations - an opportunity to
bring benefits o f private E1to poor communities in their vicinity.
Peru has modest reserves o f liquid hydrocarbons but significant reserves o f natural gas. The
37.
development o f the gas industry to satisfy a growing domestic demand for clean fuels and to bring
additional export revenues on-stream would become a key enabler for Peru's economic growth over the
coming years. Given the significant capital requirements for gas production, processing, transport and
distribution, the private sector i s expected to play a major role. The Peru LNG project, agreed during the
previous government, would become the largest private investment o f the next five years. Exports could
also be developed in the framework o f the energy integration in the Southern Cone.
Extending rural infrastructure. More investment i s needed to bring rural infrastructure services
38,
to a l e v e l where local populations can meaningfully participate in the national economy. O n l y a quarter
o f rural households have access to passable roads and less than one in 10 rural towns have public phone;
half o f Peru's rural population has access to electricity and only two-thirds to sanitation. Lack o f
transport infrastructure keeps small rural producers from reaching markets. The decentralization o f rural
roads management has been successful in building institutional capacity so that municipalities take over
efficient rural transport policies, in involving communities in the prioritization o f rural roads through
participatory planning and in ensuring adequate levels o f road maintenance. However, these policies were
only developed in h a l f o f the country and investments levels only allowed the rehabilitation o f 3 1 percent
o f the tertiary road network over the past decade.
Improving Access to MicroJinance. M i c r o and small enterprise credit by commercial banks i s
growing but i t i s still too limited to make a difference for the millions o f micro entrepreneurs. Better
lending infrastructure, greater flexibility for alternative lending tools, and enhanced governance and
institutional capacity o f the microfinance institutions are required. Agricultural lending, particularly to
smaller farmers, remains a significant challenge. Pending issues to expand availability o f financial
services in rural areas include lack o f information o n borrowers, the absence o f clear land titles and an
effective legal framework for collateral-based lending, a problematic history o f nonpayment o f
agricultural loans, and a lack o f instruments to mitigate climate risk.

39.

40.
Informality and labor. An estimated one o f every two active Peruvians works in the informal
sector. High levels o f informality and l o w levels o f formal permanent employment creation can be
attributed to slow and costly business registration procedures, complex tax filing procedures for
businesses, and inflexible labor regulation. Survey data indicates that the net loss o f jobs caused by rigid
labor legislation i s in the order o f 5 percent o f urban formal private employment (as much as 200,000
wasted j o b opportunities), for a very limited benefit in terms o f worker protection because o f weak
enforcement capacity at the Ministry o f Labor.
41.
Expanding the Reach of Labor-Intensive Sectors. T w o sectors o f the economy h o l d particular
promise for not only increasing growth, but broadening its impact: modem, export-oriented agriculture
and tourism. B o t h of these industries are labor intensive and thus have a high impact o n jobs, and can be
undertaken in many parts o f the country. In less than five years, a group o f producers o f nontraditional
fruits and vegetables (including asparagus, paprika, artichokes, avocados and grapes) entered high-value

9

market niches through distribution contracts with some o f the largest supermarket chains in the United
States and Europe. However, modem agriculture currently uses only an estimated 1 percent o f the
country’s farmland, pointing to a huge upside potential. In tourism, Peru has the greatest number of
archeological sites o f any country in South America, but a relatively underdeveloped tourism sector.
With judicious investments by both government and private sector there i s a potential for additional
growth and jobs that would benefit the poor.
Making growth environmentally sustainable. Peru i s one o f the most ecologically rich
42.
countries in the world, endowed with a large and diverse territory and an enormous wealth o f natural
resources. Until recently, the development o f economic activities and the adoption o f land use patterns
took place in the absence o f adequate environmental safeguards. For instance, although mineral resources
have been extracted for centuries, it was only in the early 1990s that the government took the first steps to
address the environmental and social impacts o f the mining sector, and began establishing a legal and
institutional framework to address the environmental impacts o f key economic activities. While recent
mining activities have attended to environmental concerns better than they have in the past, there i s a
legacy o f environmental problems from closed and abandoned mines that has not been addressed.
43.
Today’s most important environmental challenges in Peru consist of: (i)
reducing the incidence o f
waterborne diseases; (ii)minimizing illnesses caused by urban and indoor air pollution; (iii)
addressing
the vulnerability to natural disasters; (iv) decreasing lead exposure; (v) improving municipal solid waste
collection; (vi) reducing overfishing; (vii) decreasing the annual rate o f deforestation; and (viii)
preventing agricultural soil degradation. These categories o f environmental damages have an economic
cost o f 3.7 percent o f GDP and primarily affect the poor’. Annually, air pollution alone i s responsible for
an estimated 140,000 disability-adjusted life years-a massive loss for an economy whose human capital
i s limited.

44.
In fisheries, weak enforcement o f fishing rights and vessel licensing has led to massive
overcapacity, which constitutes a constant danger o f over-fishing o f the country’s main species, the
anchoveta, and has crowded out poor fishermen that rely on traditional methods. In forestry, recent
estimates reveal that Peru harbors about 68.7 million hectares o f natural forests, second only to Brazil in
Latin America, representing 53.4 percent o f the national territory. (FAO, INRENA, 2005). Deforestation
in the Sierra i s estimated to be moderately high and i s one o f the main roots o f soil erosion and reduces
agricultural yields and water holding capacity o f the mountains.
In addition to the immediate environmental problems, there i s a looming threat o f an accelerated
45.
retreat of glaciers in the Andes, which has been linked to global warming. A continued retreat o f the
glaciers could have major implications for water supply for agriculture, human consumption and for
power generation. Since the early 1980s Peruvian glaciers have lost about 22 percent o f glacier surface,
(500 Km2) equivalent to 7,000 million cubic meters o f water (about ten years o f water supply for Lima).
At lower mountain altitudes, observed climatic changes include deterioration o f watersheds and depletion
of water recharge capacities, increased likelihood o f flash fires, and biotic changes in ecosystem
thresholds and composition. These dramatic hydrological and ecological changes w i l l likely result in a
loss of global biodiversity, in addition to losses in eco-system dependent goods and services, especially
potable and agricultural water supply, and associated hydropower potential, including the loss o f
traditional water management and agricultural practices and techniques.
In contrast to the high costs associated to environmental degradation, both public and private
46.
environmental expenditures amount to about a quarter o f a percent o f GDP, l o w by international
standards. This lack o f financial support aggravates the weak institutional capacity for environmental
management. Responding to environmental challenges w i l l require establishing or strengthening
specialized agencies with clear responsibilities and adequate resources to address priorities.

Social Development

47.
Peru has experienced an almost unprecedented economic expansion over the past five years;
however, poverty and inequality have barely improved. Policies focusing o n promoting new social policy
standards and addressing basic needs are key to improving these indicators. Lack o f sufficient and
adequate human capital, and o f initial support systems within the poor are among the fundamental causes
o f poverty, particularly in the areas of education, health care, nutrition and social assistance.
Meeting Basic Needs. Poverty reduction goes along with an improvement in the basic living
48.
conditions o f the poor, Water and sanitation, electricity, and housing and property rights represent the
main challenges the government w i l l have to address in the poorest areas o f the country, especially in the
poorer highlands regions.
49.
O n water, problems span from upstream water resource management to downstream water
service delivery. Peru has abundant water, but most o f i t i s concentrated in the Amazon region, where
less than 10 percent o f the population lives and less than 10 percent o f the G D P i s generated. Unclear
water rights, lack o f metering and monitoring, fragmented and unclear division o f responsibilities,
inadequate basin-level planning all combine to weaken water management. Water service coverage i s
l o w and has not grown for almost two decades-about a quarter o f the population has n o access to potable
water and half has n o sewer system (much lower than regional averages o f 89 and 74 percent,
respectively), while three quarters o f the sewerage flow goes untreated. Moreover, where services do
exist, quality i s poor. Urban areas are affected by l o w continuity o f the service and a lack o f maintenance
o f the infrastructure, while in rural areas the quality o f water i s below standards-about 59 percent o f the
rural systems do not disinfect their water-and the sustainability o f services i s not ensured. The
government i s making water a high priority, through its Water for All program which has already been
launched.

50.
With less than 40 percent coverage in rural areas, Peru has one o f the lowest rural electrification
rates in Latin America. Close to six million people do not have access to electricity. T o meet the
government's stated goal o f 75 percent coverage in rural areas by 2015, annual investment in
electrification would have to be increased from US$40-50 m i l l i o n per year, the investment level for the
past five years, to US$85 m i l l i o n per year. A new legal, regulatory and institutional framework for rural
electrification i s also needed to increase efficiency. Another issue o f concern i s the need to secure
adequate investment levels in the sector overall, to meet growing demand.

5 1.
The supply of formal new middle- and low-income housing remains inadequate in comparison to
the rate of new household formation and loss o f stock. A t the same time, upgrading programs are not
reaching scale and the housing situation of the lower-income segments continues to deteriorate. Limited
public resources and short supply o f serviced land for low-income housing remains the major bottleneck,
particularly for the lower-income programs. Land titling programs to address these problems have had
some important successes, but an estimated 1.5 million unregistered lots remain. The integration o f legal
and spatial information, via the newly-established National Integrated Cadastre System, i s essential and
requires strengthening institutional coordination.
52.

Promoting a N e w Social Contract. Improving social services to help eradicate poverty
demands a new way o f conceptualizing and implementing social policy, based o n standards, results and
accountability. This new social contract provides a cross-cutting lens to design reforms in all the social
sectors.

53.
Peru has been remarkably successful in increasing school enrollment but much less successful in
improving the quality o f education. A recent major piece o f WB ESW work in the social sectors
concluded that the state (government, politicians), the suppliers o f education (teachers, administrators)
and consumers (pupils, parents) are locked in a l o w level equilibrium o f l o w compensations, l o w
expectations, and l o w performance.

11

54.
Even though most health indicators have improved over the last decade, Peru i s s t i l l behind when
compared with the rest o f the region. Infant and maternal mortality are twice as high as the Latin
American average. Access to health insurance and health services for the poor are far from satisfactory,
with one in every two not having any kind of insurance and two out o f every three who fall illgetting no
professional attention. The health care sector i s organized, financed and run to suit an epidemiological
profile that i s disappearing. There are five separate vertically integrated suppliers: the Ministry o f Health,
which caters mostly to the poor; the insurance system for formal workers (EsSalud); one system each for
the armed forces and the police; and a growing universe o f private, for-profit, and charitable providers. In
practice, each o f them has i t s own separate policies, funding, and facilities, thus failing to exploit
economies o f scale or pool risks.
55.
One in four children under five years old suffers from chronic malnutrition in Peru, rising to 45
percent in the rural highlands. I t i s hard to imagine Peru making substantial progress in reducing
inequality if 25 percent o f all children start life with such a severe permanent disadvantage. Until the
mid-1990’s Peru was making good progress in reducing malnutrition; then, progress essentially stopped.
From 1996 to 2004, chronic malnutrition improved by less than a point. Current figures on chronic
malnutrition have actually increased among the poor (up by 4 percentage points from 2000 to 2004) and
the extreme poor (up by almost 10 percentage points from 2000 to 2004). The deterioration among the
poor i s occurring despite the fact that Peru spends quite a bit o f money (US$250 million a year) o n
programs that claim to be able to solve the problem. The government recognizes the problem and has
launched a major effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f the relevant multi-sectoral
programs so as to reach the government target o f reducing chronic malnutrition by 5 points in 5 years.
56.
Expenditure on social assistance i s among the lowest in Latin America, amounting to 0.7 percent
of GDP. The country’s 30-odd anti-poverty programs deliver three types o f transfers to the poor-basic
food, temporary work, and community infrastructure. They reach more than nine million people-one in
every three Peruvians. However, the average benefit per person i s only about U S 2 per month, an almost
insignificant fraction o f the extreme poverty line o f U S $ l per day.

C.

Modernization o f the State

57.
The challenge for the government going forward w i l l be to gather support to reform those areas
within the state’s structure that people care most about: decentralization and public service access,
improving the efficiency and quality o f public spending, and the justice system and corruption and then
demonstrate that it has the ability to deliver the services. ,4t present, there i s a high level o f
dissatisfaction with the quality and, to a lesser extent, the coverage o f public services.
58.
Decentralization and Access to Public Services. The country needs effective decentralization
with the ability to deliver basic services locally, to better address local needs and to reduce the overcentralization o f the Peruvian state. Sub-national governments in Peru have almost no tax bases o f their
o w n (less than 0.3% o f GDP) and the national Congress sets policy over municipal property taxes.
Therefore, sub-national governments are highly dependent on transfers from the central government, on
flat shares in national tax revenues (FONCOMUN), and on income derived from natural resourcesroyalties and canons (tax sharing arrangements on income from mines and other resource extraction).
The transfer system i s highly unequal, and accentuates regional inequities rather than reducing them. The
difficult political decisions around cross-regional equalization transfers are pending.
59.
While sub-national entities do not generate their own resources, they act as agents o f the national
government and now account for about a third o f all public expenditure. W i t h the exception o f limited
parts o f the food and social and rural infrastructure programs, the responsibilities for decision-making and
accountability for results have not been passed to the sub-national governments. The government has
announced that this will change during this administration, with the big steps being a proposed

12

decentralization o f responsibilities o f administration in education and health. The twin concerns are
capacity o f the local governments and the adaptability o f some o f the core control mechanisms o f
government to a more decentralized environment. One important reform would be to decentralize
National Public Investment System (SNIP), as difficulties in passing investment projects through
SNIP has limited the ability o f sub-national governments to spend existing resources

the

Strengtheningpublic sector management. Improving the way in which public resources are spent
60.
i s a crucial job for any government, but particularly important for a country like Peru with limited fiscal
space and a large number of needs. In the recent past, Peru has made considerable advances in the area o f
fiscal management, in particular with the implementation o f the financial management system SIAF, the
reform o f budget classification systems, and first efforts at developing monitoring and evaluation systems
for different public programs, The implementation o f performance indicators, developed jointly between
the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF) and sectoral ministries, coupled w i t h evaluations o n the
results o f spending based on these indicators, could dramatically improve the ability o f the government to
achieve priority results through the budget. Other reforms such as implementing a Treasury Single
Account would also be useful to improve overall financial management in the public sector, while better
procurement rules would allow for economies o f scale in public purchasing. These entry points for state
reform w i l l allow it to scale up efforts for a new and second phase o f state reform that focuses o n the
quality o f public expenditures, These efforts w i l l be critical to reverse the dramatic decline in perceptions
o f government effectiveness, as Peru fell from the 65t’’ percentile to the 33‘d percentile in the WBI
governance indicator from 1998 to 2005.
Improving the Justice System and Reducing Corruption. The judicial system in Peru i s perceived
61.
as corrupt, inaccessible, and inefficient. The WBI governance indicator related to the r u l e o f law i s l o w
and has actually deteriorated slightly in 2005 as compared to previous years. There i s little accountability
for performance-indicators
o f judicial productivity are not published. Three significant barriers to
access exist: a) economic (high costs in terms o f fees and time, especially for the poor); b) ethno-cultural
(lack of understanding o f laws and procedures by the poor and especially indigenous people); and c) the
perception o f corruption. Once inside the system, the main issue i s inefficiency-most
courts are
overwhelmed by a backlog o f cases, which facilitates corruption in delaying or advancing cases. A
critical problem i s the judiciary’s low technical capacity, which i s in turn caused by politically-influenced
selection mechanisms, limited opportunities for continuing training, and outdated physical infrastructure
and support systems, especially for case management.

62.
During the 1990s, both judicial independence and institutional capacity were severely weakened
in Peru. Nonetheless, in recent years the justice system which includes the courts as well as ancillary
institutions has undertaken a renewed process o f institutional strengthening, including a sector-wide
commission called CERIAJUS. Although a community justice system w i t h greater credibility (Justicia de
paz) exists, it receives little financial and technical support. This provides a promising avenue for lowcost improvements to the justice system. Another recent innovation that can be scaled up i s the successful
implementation of specialized commercial courts in the L i m a Judicial District.
63.
Public procurement and financial management in Peru have significantly improved over the past
five years. This, however, has not yet translated into improvements in perceptions o f corruption.
Ironically, the WBI indicator on governance related to control o f corruption reveals better results during
the last years of Fujimori (before the Montesinos scandal broke) than in 2005. This may be due to the
lack of voice, accountability and transparency that prevailed during the last years o f Fujimori. When
Peru’s ratings o n voice and accountability were in the 25”’ percentile, the ratings on control o f corruption
and government effectiveness and regulatory quality were rated considerably higher than they are today.
N o w that the voice and accountability i s around the 50“’ percentile, the other WBI governance indicators
are now much lower. Whether this reflects actual deterioration in these aspects o f governance or a
lingering effect of the loss o f trust in government caused by the scandals o f the Fujimori era i s hard to
determine.

13

64.
Recent reforms on transparency in public spending now place Peru among the top tier o f
developing countries in terms of transparency. Peru scored 77 percent out o f a possible 100 on the Open
Budget Index 2006 (an index evaluating the quantity o f information provided to citizens o n the central
government’s budget and financial activities). However, existing channels o f civil participation have no
mandate to focus on accountability (vendicidn de cuentas). They provide ex-ante advice, but cannot hold
the government responsible ex-post for results nor even monitor actual performance against pre-agreed
upon standards. Access to accurate, timely and comprehensive information on public procurement,
financial management and civil service performance w i l l be half o f the equation in restoring trust in the
state’s capacity to act honestly and transparently. The other half i s to let citizens voice their views o n the
results o f those actions.

IV.
A.

THEPROGRAM

Strategic Elements of the CPS

65.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) i s being prepared at a time when there has been strong
country performance over the last four years, a striking commonality in the development visions o f the
government and the WBG, and a close working relation that has rapidly evolved with the new
administration and, indeed, with many o f the key stakeholders in the country.’ This CPS w i l l cover a
period o f five years, coinciding with the period o f the administration. During this period, there w i l l be a
CPS Progress Report presented to the Board two years into implementation and a CPS Completion Report
submitted at the end o f the period.
66.
The CPS emphasizes partnerships, flexibility and results. The first level o f partnership is, o f
course, between the WBG and the government. But there w i l l also be efforts during the CPS period to
deepen the already good relations with civil society, the private sector, Congress and other members o f
the international cooperation community. The W B G w i l l increase dissemination o f i t s activities within
the country through the Public Information Center, the media and in diverse public seminars and
presentations. The emphasis on partnerships also means partnerships within the WBG to better serve
Peru. In the development o f this CPS, the IBRD and IFC worked closely to identify areas where the two
can best work together to exploit synergies. In addition to IFC, MIGA has been very active in Peru’s
mining industry and its due diligence and monitoring efforts are to ensure compliance o f the projects w i t h
Extractive Industries Review principles. MIGA w i l l participate in this strategy by providing support visa-vis its planning and implementation o f good governance and transparency practices o f foreign mining
companies and in collaborating with local governments to enact these principles.

A second distinguishing feature o f this CPS i s an enhanced flexibility in the WBG program. The
67.
CPS allows for greater flexibility in the amounts o f financing to be provided and the content and timing
of different lending operations. The third distinguishing feature o f this CPS i s the emphasis on results.
The WBG has specified indicators and targets at levels midway between individual projects and the broad
pillars of economic growth, social development and modernization o f institutions that appear in both the

9.

I t has been possible to establish a close, working relation with the new administration relatively quickly after
the election because the W o r l d Bank had been engaged with the four m a i n political parties during the election
campaign. Taking care to make the same offer to each o f the four leading parties, the WBG arranged a series
of separate meetings, VCs and visits w i t h WBG staff working in Peru and in the region for the technical teams
of the different parties which were charged w i t h preparing the government plans. This allowed for useful
exchanges o f views and experiences.

14

WBG Policy Notes and the government plan." This has been done in recognition o f the fact that to

achieve a particular outcome, it w i l l often be necessary to combine different activities (lending operations,

AAA, technical assistance, and IFC investments). The particular combination o f activities that together
contribute to a limited set o f related outcomes i s referred to as a cluster.

B.

Clusters

68.

For each pillar, a set o f clusters were designed in consultation w i t h the government, along w i t h
indicators that w i l l be used to gauge progress within the cluster and the WBG activities that either
currently exist or are proposed for the next five year period The clusters are as follows:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Maintaining macro stability and reducing vulnerabilities;
Accelerating growth and widening i t s base
Making growth environmentally sustainable
Meeting Basic Needs
Promoting and developing a new social contract in education, health and nutrition; and
Modernizing state institutions.

69.
The Results Matrix in Annex B10 lists the country outcomes expected at the end o f the period for
each cluster and the existing and proposed lending operations, ESW, I F C investments and TA that would
contribute to the goals o f the cluster.'' The particular activities within each cluster have been or w i l l be
selected to be: a) consistent w i t h the GOP and W B G vision; b) within the area o f expertise o f the WBG;
c) directed to solve problems that are not merely financial (the government can go to other sources of
financing for that); d) concentrated in areas where WBG assistance can be helpful in addressing
weaknesses in strategic planning and/or implementation and where our stakeholders believe that the
WBG can make a difference; and e) undertaken where conditions for success are present. If conditions
are not present and the area i s important, the WBG may work to improve conditions for success through
ESW, communication and advocacy.
I t i s worth noting that there are several important activities that the WBG will carry out that cut
across a l l the clusters. One i s to prepare a revised set o f Policy Notes for the incoming administration in
2011. The preparation o f the Policy Notes proved to be quite useful w i t h the past transition and should be
continued. A second cross-cutting activity i s the ongoing program o f strategic communication, financed
as a separate piece o f AAA.I2 However, w i t h the exception o f these two broad activities, everything that
the WBG will be doing over the next five years w i l l fall into one or another o f the clusters.

70.

7 1.
Maintaining Macro Stubility and Reducing Viilnerabilities. T o increase Peru's ability to maintain
macro stability, the WBG w i l l support the government w i t h a series o f DPLs covering Fiscal
Management and Competitiveness in the five years o f the administration. The specific content o f the
DPL w i l l change over time, but each DPL w i l l support these two overarching objectives in one way or
another. Among the areas to be covered o n the fiscal side are: strengthening o f fiscal rules, tax policy
and tax administration, results-based budgeting, public debt management, system o f fiscal transfers and
compensations. If
the government decides to pursue other aspects o f state reform, particularly in the area
of c i v i l service, the DPLs could be adapted to support specific objectives in that area.

l o There may also be specific indicators and targets that would be specified for the individual projects or activities
that may differ from the cluster level indicators and targets. This would be presented when the project concept note
i s prepared. These potential additional indicators and targets are not discussed in the CPS.
II
I t i s important to note that the results to be achieved over the upcoming CPS period will depend as much on the
existing projects and the influence o f recent AAA as on the proposed new lending operations and AAA.
l 2 The particular issues to stress in the strategic communication would vary over the years. Initially, dissemination
of the Policy Notes, the Doing Business Results, the C E A and the Social and Environmental Aspects of Mining
would be featured. The strategy would involve dissemination o f country, regional and world wide WBG products.

15

72.
In addition to the DPLs, the Bank w i l l continue to support government efforts to reduce
dollarization in the economy and to address public debt management issues, focusing o n both institutional
strengthening and medium-term debt issuance strategies through technical assistance to the Debt Office.
The IFC’s support to reducing vulnerabilities w i l l be through efforts to deepen local capital markets,
which w i l l also help reduce dollarization. The Bank will support government promotion o f disaster risk
management and w i l l consider structuring part o f the support as a line o f credit. T o reduce vulnerabilities
associated with the social and environmental aspects o f mining (particularly from environmental
legacies), the WBG would consider incorporating key policy measures in an Environmental D P L and/or
an investment operation.
Accelerating Growth and Widening its Base. Within this cluster, the WBG w i l l address some o f
73.
the key constraints to achieving higher growth through a combination o f policy-based lending, investment
loans, technical assistance, AAA and F C private sector investments. There will also be specific activities
to widen the base o f growth to ensure that the benefits reach the poor, especially the indigenous
populations largely concentrated in the Sierra, I t i s in this cluster that the greatest synergy between the
IFC and WB i s expected to be realized. The main policy-based instrument to support competitiveness
will be the afore-mentioned D P L series on Fiscal Management and Competitiveness. The government’s
own plans in this area and the analytical work completed under the Policy Notes provide a good basis for
the measures to be included in the initial DPLs. Over the course o f the DPLs, it i s expected that there
would be support to address infrastructure needs, the development o f local capital markets and the access
to those markets and the low level o f technological development in the country. Further AAA on publicprivate partnerships and progress with the FTAs w i l l provide a solid analytical underpinning for policy
measures to be supported in the later DPLs.

74.
The WBG has supported the government’s efforts in fostering the sound development o f
domestic financial markets and w i l l continue to do so. A comprehensive financial sector assessment was
carried out by the WBG together with the IMF in early 2005, which provided the government with a
roadmap o f actions. The Bank has also provided important technical assistance to Foildo M i Vivienda
(FMV), the government program that funded most o f the recent expansion in mortgage lending in Peru. A
Bank-promoted multi-donor FIRST grant helped design new products that favor the introduction o f local
currency mortgage lending, and sets the basis for future growth through securitization o f mortgages.
Another ongoing FIRST-funded technical assistance i s helping promote the development o f innovative
capital markets funding alternatives for small businesses, namely micro-credit securitization by municipal
financing institutions and receivables-based debt issuance; both mechanisms would be denominated in
local currency. IFC led innovative transactions - the Inka Bond, IFC’s first local bond issue, which
contributed to the development o f the local bond market, Universidad San Martin de Porres - a PCG for
an up to US$10 million for a local bond issue supporting an education project.

The WBG has a number o f investment loans directed towards improving competitiveness and
75.
accelerating growth. These include a Trade and Competitiveness TA Loan, an Agricultural Research and
Extension Loan, an Irrigation Loan and several Transport Loans. In the future, i t i s expected that there
would be additional lending for infrastructure, particularly in the rural areas. However, much o f the
country’s infrastructure needs in ports, regional airports and roads are expected to be met by continued
use of concessions. The WBG has recently completed an extensive piece o f AAA on concessions and has
introduced a Guarantee Facility which makes available partial risk guarantees for upcoming concessions.
The take-up on the offer o f a guarantee has been a bit slow, but in the most recent concessions there has
been increased interest exhibited by potential concessionaires. I f the initial US$200 million made
available for the guarantees i s used over the course o f this CPS period, i t would be possible to replenish
the facility. IFC investments included three projects in infrastructure (road, telecom, power transmission)
with loans totaling US$SS million. In the real sectors, IFC focused on improving competitiveness in a
broad range o f sectors (logistics, infrastructure, finance, agribusiness, etc.) while enhancing the
environmental and social sustainability o f such projects.

16

76.
There are ongoing efforts to improve the business environment, promoted by the Business
Enabling Environment of the I F C Technical Assistance Facility, This will be enhanced by a D o i n g
Business Loan that w i l l be directed to addressing some o f the remaining micro constraints to growth. I t
will follow up o n the existing Trade and Competitiveness Project which w i l l be closing in a year.

77.

I F C will address the private sector challenges through: (i)
the financial sector (micro-finance
institutions and financing supporting the growth o f the mortgage market); (ii)
infrastructure, to enhance
competitiveness; (iii)
direct investment in the j o b producingiincome generating real and service sectors
(manufacturing, tourism, agribusiness, and social sectors); (iv) sustainable development and capacity
building (natural resources) sector; and (v) administrative simplification and investment climate w o r k
through i t s technical assistance facility. The IFC w i l l continue to focus o n income-generating projects for
the rural poor. The municipal business environment w i l l be enhanced by IFC’s Technical Assistance
Facility through its Business Simplification program in selected municipalities. The Enhancing Local
Benefits Programs (Box 1) will help create new business opportunities in selected areas o f the southern
highlands, as significant additional revenues from the Mining canon are expected to result into new public
works programs to be undertaken by local governments (See Annex C for more detail o n IFC’s Private
Sector Strategy).
Box 1. LAC Technical Assistance (TA) Facility
The I F C LAC T A facility, which i s very active in Peru, i s supported by I F C o w n financing and by donor financing
(SECO, CIDA, DFID, N I P P and TATF). The two main aspects o f the T A facility have been the municipal
administrative simplification program, and efforts to improve the use o f mining-derived resources among municipal
governments in Cajamarca. B o t h programs have been highly successfbl, and are expected to be scaled up during the
CPS period. As a result o f the simplification efforts in the provincial municipality o f L i m a that went into effect in
the beginning o f 2006, permits that formerly required 60 days to process are n o w finished in three days. Business
owners formerly needed to visit government offices 11 times on average during the process, but n o w only have to go
once or twice. While previously a single process was required for all companies, now risk categories help the
municipality differentiate services. And importantly, the cost for undertaking these processes for small and medium
enterprises has fallen by over half. The response has been impressive: while the municipality processed on average
about 1000 licenses for commercial activities per year previous to the reforms, they processed over 5000 in the first
seven months o f 2006. Regarding municipal finances, in the municipality o f Bafios de Inca, near the Yanacocha
mine, municipal investment capacity increased five-fold from 2001-2003 (before the project started) to 2005, and i s
on its way to surpass US$6 million by the end o f FY 2006. This has translated into over 100 projects in 50
communities, with roughly h a l f addressing health and education needs and more than 20 percent on productive
infrastructure like roads and irrigation. As well, information o n mining income and investment projects i s publicly
available.

78.
The two Sierra Development Projects are the main WBG programs to support the government’s
efforts to increase the productive potential o f the poor in the Sierra. The proposed project aims to improve
rural productivity and employment by linking farmers to markets w i t h the help o f local governments. In
addition to supporting the formation o f these strategic alliances, the project would (i)
provide training for
product quality improvement; (ii)empower local producers and farmers’ groups through regional
strengthen institutions providing services
competitive funds that support small project proposals; and (iii)
to producers. The government i s in the process o f refining the set o f activities related to enhancing
productive potential in a Sierra Exportadora program. This program w i l l be combined w i t h other
programs to extend productive and social infrastructure to this historically neglected area. Under the
territorial approach being promoted by the WBG Sierra Development Projects, there w i l l be a review o f
all existing and planned rural infrastructure and productive projects to see h o w they could contribute to
development in the region. The I F C i s also exploring how some o f their TA programs in Business
Environment and Access to Finance could help in the Sierra. Facilitating access to the resources o f the

17

Mining canon, as demonstrated by IFC’s pilot project in the Cajamarca region, can stimulate public
investment and the private sector when municipalities in the Sierra contract out private companies.

79.
Another key area o f work for the WBG i s in the area o f informality. The IBRD i s now beginning
the second phase o f a very successful urban property rights project and there will be an effort to link this
work with the IFC investments in micro finance institutions and the TA work in access to finance and
business environment development. Complementing a study on microeconomic constraints to growth
that was carried out a few years ago, there w i l l be a series o f two studies on informality, carried out
largely by IBRD, but with contributions from IFC.
As indicated earlier, Peru w i l l need to widen the sectoral base o f growth. There i s considerable
80.
potential for tourism, given the numerous archeological sights, the natural beauty and biodiversity o f the
country. The IBRD has an existing project in the Vilcanota Valley and there i s scope to continue to
develop the public infrastructure needed for tourism. The IFC already has successful investments in
tourism and there i s the possibility of making further investments that would complement the IBRD
project to support job creation for the poor and revenue generation.

8 1.
Making Growth Environmentally Sustainable.
Given the relatively l o w profile that
environmental issues have in Peru, there i s clearly a need to carry out some strategic communication to
place environmental concerns higher up on the agenda. The WBG has recently completed three important
pieces o f AAA-on fisheries, social and environmental aspects o f mining and an extensive Country
Environmental Assessment. I t may be u s e h l to consider further work related to the consequences of
climate change for Peru. There w i l l now be an effort to disseminate the findings in these studies and to
promote more extensive debate within the country about the importance o f addressing environmental
concerns. T o allow for follow-up to the interest that i s expected to be generated by the strategic
dissemination, the CPS includes a potential set o f DPLs that w i l l enhance environmental public
investments from the government and strengthen the institutional framework. The ongoing Management
of Protected Areas GEF and the Irrigation Subsector Investment program w i l l complement the package
addressing biodiversity and water resource issues. Furthermore, IFC w i l l continue to promote
sustainability throughout the private sector, incorporating environmental and social concerns into its o w n
projects and in the private sector at large.
82.
While i t may take some time for the environmental concerns, particularly those related to climate
change, to be introduced into specific lending operations, urgent action i s needed to document, with a
higher level o f certainty, anticipated climate impacts in the Andean region, and to fomulate adaptation
policy actions and measures that w i l l illustrate how to meliorate these potential catastrophic changes. A
regional GEF project, the proposed Implementation o f Pilot Climate Change Adaptation Measures to the
impacts of rapid Glacier Retreat in the Andean Region i s under preparation. Through this project, Andean
Governments, including Peru, are beginning to emphasize the need to design and implement
Development Plans that take into account the impacts o f climate change in high mountain ecosystems. In
addition, a Climate Change Implementation Grant has recently been approved, which w i l l provide longrequired funding to strengthen the science and observation on high altitude mountain habitats in Peru and
other countries in the region.
83.
Meeting Basic Needs. This cluster i s organized to assess some o f the key equity issues o f the new
government’s agenda, and would include a set o f basic infrastructure interventions and technical
assistance, including low income housing, titling, electrification and water and sanitation programs. I t i s
positioned to support the Ministry o f Housing and Infrastructure’s own program, which also focuses on
clusters. This program includes direct support to the Agiia Para Todos water program, the Mi Vivienda
low-income housing program and the Mi Barrio urban upgrading program. Ongoing projects such as the
L i m a Water Rehabilitation and the Rural Electrification projects w i l l complement the package. If there i s
demand, the WBG could also consider an electricity modernization program. The Bank’s Andean
Regional Program for Water and Sanitation, and other bilateral donors w i l l continue work on institutional

18

and technical issues in the sector. Institutional activities w i l l include participation in the water strategy
assessment to be lead by the Bank’s water team, and a set o f pilot programs in the small cities in poor
peri-urban communities. These activities w i l l be complemented by the “Handwashing” initiative led by
the Water and Sanitation Network. The I F C w i l l contribute by exploring options to increase private
sector participation in the water sector (e.g. combine the WB Guarantee Facility with IFC investments).
Given IFC’s housing finance experience in the L A C region, the promotion o f regional links and southsouth investments w i l l also be an important element o f this strategy. The recent I F C investment in
Titularizadora Pertiana, which w i l l assemble pools o f mortgages and securitize them, w i l l support the
primary mortgage market by providing needed long-term funding, while promoting the establishment and
development o f the secondary mortgage market.
Promoting and developing a new social contract in education, health and nutrition. The
84.
activities included in this cluster draw upon the findings on results and accountability in the social sectors
in the RECURSO study, an extensive and successful piece o f AAA carried out by the Bank and supported
by DFID. There w i l l be a programmatic continuation o f the analytical work begun under RECURSO,
w i t h the new lending projects beginning to incorporate the key lessons from the study. All o f the projects
w i l l have a strong focus on results, beginning w i t h the Second Health APL and the Nutrition Results
investment loans. O n top of these interventions the Quality o f Education technical assistance loan will
seek to build up the government’s long-term plan on education as a way to raise the basic standards
needed to improve the educational levels in the long term. T w o DPLs w i l l support the key policy changes
needed to develop this results orientation in the social sectors and to support the recently-announced
decentralization o f education and health programs to the municipalities. This sectoral effort to instill a
greater results orientation w i l l also benefit from the support to results-based budgeting within the MEF
supported by the series o f Fiscal Management and Competitiveness DPLs.

85.
There w i l l also be a tertiary education loan to address the technological needs that are likely to
become increasingly apparent as the economy grows. The IFC focus w i l l look into financing initiatives
that improve the quality and increase access to higher education. Potential areas may include student loan
scheme with private local banks and, depending o n the initiative o f the government, may support publicprivate partnerships in the sector.
86.
Modernizing state institutions. In this pillar, there i s a single cluster covering a focused set o f
activities related to improving justice and reducing corruption, strengthening public sector management
and assisting in the process o f decentralization. The on-going Justice Services Project TAL has been
designed to develop services that benefit a wide variety o f users, as well as regain citizen respect. I t
focuses o n achieving better service planning and resource management, a more coordinated policymaking process and the empowering o f regional units (1.e. judicial districts and local court offices).

87.
The CPS program includes a Governance Enhancement Program.
The highest pay-off
governance enhancement program would be a far-reaching justice reform project. However, this could
only go forward ifthe conditions for success are present. Prior to the project, there w i l l be a piece o f
AAA that w i l l be managed in a way similar to the RECURSO project. That is, it w i l l try to present the
case for reform in the justice sector in a way that might spur the key actors to take action. I f there i s not
sufficient political support, the Governance Enhancement Program would be directed towards other
governance activities, such as improvements to oversight operations for government contracting, that
while not having the same impact as a justice reform effort, would s t i l l be important.
88.
In the area of governance, the programmatic AAA o f the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) w i l l introduce a more objective measure o f the quality o f transactions. Since the
S I A F provides information o n all government transactions, i t i s possible to draw a scientific sample and
define explicit standards for the quality o f transactions to create an index that measures the percentage o f
all government transactions that are judged to be best practice. The criteria could be defined by the
Comptroller General, c i v i l society institutions such as Transparency International, procurement and

19

financial management specialists from the WBG and OECD and practitioners in the anti-corruption field
such as investigators from the WB’s own INT department. These criteria should be defined ex-ante and
each transaction should be classified as either satisfying the best practice standards or failing to satisfy the
standards. This measure can be tracked over time and compared across different sectors and different
local governments. I t i s an alternative to the perception-based measure^.'^

89.
In addition, the WBG w i l l follow up on the recommendations found in the recent CPAR and the
C F A A studies, and w i l l continue providing non-lending technical assistance to the Comptroller General,
in an open, programmable manner. The program w i l l also seek to enforce the congressional oversight o f
the Comptroller General, as the final control o f public funds at the government level, and as a basis for an
anticorruption program to cover public spending at all levels o f government. Finally, the WBG w i l l
explore with its partners the possibility of financing support to investigative journalism to address
problems o f corruption.
90.
The Fiscal Management and Competitiveness DPLs w i l l support government actions to
strengthen budget reporting and planning, and to improve the control and impact o f public spending. K e y
policies include the modernization of budget processes, institutions and information systems. Due to the
strong political support and the desire for more accountability in the country, the government has initiated
the first steps towards results-oriented practices, as a means o f improving the efficiency and quality o f
public spending and service delivery. The D P L w i l l support the design and implementation o f a resultsbased budgeting process at the MEF, starting from the development o f outcome and performance
indicators, monitoring and evaluation practices and l i n k s to the budget cycle. The Social D P L w i l l support
the implementation of monitoring and evaluation systems at the social programs level, focusing on
standards and accountability in the social sectors. The two existing TALs are important instruments to
support the intuitional capacity needed to modernize public sector management. N e w challenges have
emerged with the decentralization process and the upcoming PER will evaluate those and offer policy
recommendations. The e-government agenda and activities related to simplify administrative processes
are also an important component o f the Fiscal Management and Competitiveness program and part o f this
cluster.
91.
The two programmatic PEFAs w i l l also review public expenditures and w i l l recommend
improvements in national information systems necessary to support measurement o f national and regional
goals. Better information systems are essential to the results-oriented approach that the government
would like to implement.
92.
IFC’s intervention w i l l be through the Enhancing Local Benefits (ELB) program o f the L A C TA
facility. The ELB program has a two-pronged approach: working directly w i t h municipal government,
selected in relation to the mining canon, on one side, and working with civil society o n the other. The
objective i s to improve the social accountability and efficiency o f municipal government through capacity
building assistance (e.g. local procurement, project management), as well as the development o f an
independent monitoring mechanism with civil society organizations. This assistance i s part o f IFC’s
broader objective of helping improve the local development impact o f extractive industries in Peru, in line
with management’s recommendations to the EITI.
93.
Over the last CAS period, there were a series of programmatic DPLs that assisted the government
in setting up a structure o f rules and regulations for decentralization. One o f the main objectives o f this
effort was to ensure against the risk o f losing fiscal control as the decentralization proceeded. Over the
upcoming CPS period, the bulk o f the WBG activities to support decentralization will be provided by the
sectoral investment operations, particularly the social sectors and infrastructure. In the social sectors,
there are investment operations in health, nutrition and education. There i s also a programmatic DPL .for
13.

As indicated earlier, the 2005 Governance Indicators suggest a worse performance for Peru in the control o f col-ruption
today than at the height o f the (undiscovered) corruption scandals o f Montesinos. This i s a probleiii inherent in purely
perception based measures.

20

the Social Sectors, a TA loan for decentralizatior, and a programmatic series o f AAA. The critical mass
The
o f operations i s warranted given the importance o f getting this decentralization right.
decentralization could provide an opportunity to make a very significant contribution to the goals of
improving quality o f social services and advancing equity goals.
In infrastructure, there are also ample vehicles to help address decentralization issues, including
94.
existing or planned infrastructure projects in electricity, water, housing, irrigation and transport. As well,
the Sierra Development Projects that w i l l be taking a territorial approach. The programmatic PEFAs and
the AAA on financing infrastructure and public-private partnerships must necessarily touch upon
decentralization. The study w i l l accompany the supervision o f the current Accountability for the
Decentralization o f the Social Sectors and the Institutional Capacity for Decentralization TALs. IFC's
program under the L A C TA facility (business simplificatiodcapacity building) at the municipal level,
notably with respect to improved management o f the mining canon, w i l l play a role in ensuring that the
effects o f decentralization are felt at the municipal level through more and better public investment at the
local level.

If there i s a need to revisit the rules and regulations that had been developed in the earlier D P L
95.
operations, the needed actions could be supported in the series o f programmatic DPLs o n Fiscal
Management and Competitiveness.
C.

Program Envelope

96.
The previous CAS was prepared at a time when the country situation was s t i l l uncertain and the
size o f the Bank program was quite small. The Peru program reached a l o w point o f nine investment
projects and net commitment amounts o f US$286 million in FY04. As the country started to re-emerge
from i t s crisis, the IBRD portfolio and extent o f AAA began to recover to reach today's portfolio o f 16
investment projects with US$516 million in net commitments. N o w that the country has established a
solid track record and has signaled interest in working more extensively w i t h the Bank, the country team
considers that Peru i s in an excellent position to increase the program's envelope.
97.
Over the previous CAS period, the IFC averaged investments o f US$60 million per year. During
this period IFC invested in building a physical presence in Peru including investment and technical
assistance staff. W i t h this added capacity, IFC projects that during the period o f the current CPS i t s
investment w i l l increase to over US$lOO million per year. In addition, IFC w i l l leverage i t s technical
assistance through i t s knowledge transfer and convening power to generate impacts in the areas o f
municipal capacity building, enhancing the social and environmental benefits o f private sector
development to local communities, access to finance for SMEs and explore opportunities sectoral work
on strengthening supply chains (e.g. forestry, agribusiness). The extent o f IFC TA, especially in support
of the Sierra Exportadora program, to be conducted under the L A C TA Facility w i l l depend on future
donor support.
98.
Under the current CPS, a flexible base case lending envelope w i l l allow for lending commitments
of up to U S $ 700 million per annum on average or maximum US$ 3.5 billion over the entire CPS horizon
(FY07 through FY11). Fast disbursing lending commitments w i l l average US$ 400 million per annum,
reaching maximum US$ 2.0 billion over the entire horizon. Fast disbursing loan commitments are
expected to increase from US$ 350 million in FY07 to US$ 450 million towards the end o f the CPS
horizon. Full commitment o f the above lending envelope would result in an exposure o f US$ 4.5 billion
as of end-FY11 compared to an exposure of US$ 2.7 billion as o f end-FY06. The appropriateness o f the
current lending program w i l l be continuously monitored, and w i l l be reassessed at the midpoint CPS
Progress Report. In particular, the appropriateness o f the lending program w i l l be assessed o n the basis o f
a continuation o f Peru's favorable growth performance, further progress in poverty reduction, soundness
of the fiscal policy stance including further strengthening o f public revenue raising performance,
advances in the dedollarization process and no marked deterioration in IBRD and preferred creditor
exposure indicators.

21

99.
There w i l l s t i l l be a low case, with disbursements not to exceed $120 million per year exclusively
o n investment projects, if there is: a) a marked deterioration o f the fiscal policy stance as evidenced by a
persistent rise in the public debt/GDP ratio; b) a reversal on trade policy; or c) a reversal in the
independence o f the Central Bank.
100.
The IBRD would expect to have around three investment projects and around two DPLs per year.
The particular lending activities would be decided every year by the government and WBG management,
within the different clusters identified above. An indicative selection for FY07-11 i s provided below.

Use o f WB Financial Products

10 1. In recent years, the WBG has greatly increased the variety and flexibility o f the banking products
that it can offer to i t s clients. Peru as one o f the earlier countries to use IBRD Fixed Spread Loan (FSL),
has already taken advantage o f this flexibility by: a) customizing the repayment profile in the Third
Programmatic Decentralization and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan (DPL), negotiated in
December 2005 for US$150 million, which helped smooth the repayment profile and reduce refinancing
risks o f i t s debt; and b) converting four o f the 18 existing F S L IBRD loans to fixed rates, corresponding
to 16 percent o f their total portfolio with the IBRD, which helped reduce the interest rate risk.
102.
Over the CPS period, there w i l l be further work to ensure that the recent innovations in IBRD
banking products are used to optimize not only the debt portfolio that the country holds w i t h the Bank,
but i t s overall debt portfolio with all creditors. This w i l l be done by changing the financial characteristics
of existing loans where it makes sense to do so and by paying close attention to the selection o f the
banking product that w i l l be used for new loans. Among the possible future actions are: a) to offer interest
rate and currency conversions and swap for their existing FSLs, Variable Spread Loans (VSLs), and nonIBRD loans so as to diminish their currency and interest rate risks;I4b) to consider the possibility that the
14.

Peru entered into a Master Derivatives Agreement (MDA) with the IBRD, which gave the Peruvian government
access to additional IBRD hedging products and risk management tools for their V S L and other IBRD loans.

22

IBRD could provide banking products denominated in soles, subject to market conditions that would
allow Peru to hrther reduce their currency risk; and c) to assist the authorities o n how to use IBRD
flexibility on a portfolio basis rather than on a loan by loan basis, “interchanging” grace periods and
maturities among the different projects that w i l l be prepared and negotiated each year under this CPS.

E.

Results

103.
Promoting a greater results orientation in Peru. The Government o f Peru has a strong interest in
improving the results orientation of i t s public expenditures and the WBG has an equally strong interest in
supporting them in this task. The CPS includes a number o f elements that are intended to help support
this greater results orientation. First, through the series o f Fiscal Management and Competitiveness
DPLs, the WBG w i l l be supporting the government’s efforts to introduce a results-based framework for
budget allocations within the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. This framework w i l l be implemented in
stages, with the first stage being simply to introduce a consideration o f the results obtained within a sector
in yearly reviews o f the budget. As part o f this first phase it w i l l be necessary to upgrade existing
information systems, which currently are not in a position to meet the demands placed upon them by a
greater results 0rientati0n.l~ A second phase would include a reorganization o f the budget to make i t
easier to identify discrete activities that contribute to achieving results and the introduction o f positive
incentives to achieve results. At present, the budget consists o f many different line items that do not at all
facilitate the task o f managing for results. A third phase would be for different line ministries to be able
to specify 4 to 5 priority results and be able to specify the activities that they would need to undertake to
achieve those results. In this third phase, which the government and WBG would hope to reach by the
end o f the period, the goals w i l l not be overly ambitious. There w i l l be an effort to introduce this results
orientation in 3 to 4 ministries and to have this approach account for perhaps 40% o f total expenditure
within a ministry.
104.
Second, in this CPS period the W B G w i l l work directly with the sectors (particularly the social
sectors) to increase their results orientation. This w i l l involve collaborating not only with the government
but also with civil society. The instruments w i l l include the series o f Social Sector DPLs and specific
investment operations, where the WBG w i l l provide hands-on assistance in how to link policy actions to
results. The WBG proposes to select one investment project per year in this CPS period in which the
project will specify an explicit target to be met and w i l l work backwards to figure out what must be done
to achieve that target.I6 The first w i l l be a Nutrition Results Project to be presented to the Board around
April, 2007. The Nutrition Results Project i s designed to help the government and other key partners
identify what needs to be done to help the country reduce i t s rate o f chronic malnutrition by five points in
five years and then to direct IBRD financing to those activities that w i l l have the greatest impact,
regardless of the sector in which the activity takes place.

105.
All results-oriented projects w i l l follow an approach that has four main elements: a) setting
explicit targets; b) introducing incentives to deliver results; c) developing an explicit results chain that
l i n k s policy actions to results; and d) basing the necessary monitoring and evaluation on the explicit
results chain.

l5

’‘

Currently, the IBRD i s in the process o f negotiating and amendment to the Master Derivative Agreement to
include hedging transactions for loans and other debt not contracted w i t h the IBRD that would allow Peru the
use o f hedging products for the entire public debt portfolio.
I t will also be useful to assist the government in improving i t s system o f poverty measurement. Recent changes
in the household surveys have run into some implementation difficulties which must be resolved if Peru i s to
have a reliable system for tracking consumption-based measures o f poverty in the future.
This approach builds, in part, on work carried out under the Health Reform APL 1 project which has been very
successful in setting targets for maternal mortality, identifying the causal factors that give rise to the problem
and developing targeted interventions to address the critical problems.

23

106.
Starting from a target and working backwards by asking what does it take to reach the target
generates a substantially different dynamic in the preparation o f a project than defining a set o f policies
and working forwards by asking what would be the impact o f those policies. The CPS i s adopting the
approach o f setting a target and working backwards because i t i s closer to the spirit o f the interest in
results, as reflected in the MDGs. I t i s important that a benchmarking exercise be done to help set the
target so as to avoid problems associated with chasing an unrealistic target or setting a target that i s not
sufficiently ambitious. I t i s also helpful to be able to define standards related to the achievement o f the
national goal that have some meaning for an individual or a family.” In the case o f nutrition, for
example, it i s possible to define whether a child i s within acceptable ranges in growth monitoring charts.
107.
Rarely are the particular mechanisms that are thought to lead from policy actions to results made
explicit. The Nutrition Results Project w i l l pioneer the use o f tools from system dynamics to explicitly
link policy actions to results-in effect allowing the modeling o f the results chain. These techniques have
been used by the private sector to address complexity in the operation o f a system, but are not yet in
widespread use in results-based operational work. Once an explicit results chain i s developed, it i s easier
to identify the intermediate actions that must be carried out to achieve an outcome. An important part of
the results approach w i l l be to follow up on these intermediate actions and also to review periodically
whether corrective action i s necessary.
108.
Complementing the technical work w i l l be the introduction o f incentives to achieve results at both
the national and local level. A t the national level, the WBG i s exploring with U N D P and the government
the possibility o f using a buy-down to provide an incentive to achieve results. In this approach, the
country would take out a loan to achieve a result. The technical work described above would be carried
out. Then, if the results were achieved, donations from either private foundations or bilateral agencies
would be made to cover the costs incurred by the government to achieve the result-effectively lowering
the cost o f the loan. This generates a more effective risk sharing than currently exists with loans and
donations managed separately. With a loan, the risk o f not achieving value for money falls o n the
country. W i t h a donation, the risk o f not achieving value for money falls on the donor.
109.
There have been precedents with a results buy-down in connection with polio in Nigeria and
India. In the case o f the Peru Nutrition Results Project, the incentives would be structured not only to
carry out one single action-vaccination-but
also to promote more proactive work to figure out how
best to combine activities to generate an outcome. The donations would likely be structured as parallel
agreements that would have two payoffs-one ifkey outputs that are widely considered important to
achieving an outcome are undertaken and another if the outcome o f interest (Le. a reduction o f chronic
malnutrition of five points in five years) i s attained. This project i s being prepared in a collaborative way
with a strong partnership among the World Bank, the government and the Nutrition Initiative (a coalition
of NGOs, UN agencies and bilateral Agencies interested in promoting nutrition) who all agree on the goal
and on the need to collaborate to achieve the desired result.
110.
The second results-oriented project i s likely to be one related to the quality o f basic education.
This would build on the extensive and very successful experience with the R E C U R S 0 activities. As a
result of this AAA, the government i s undertaking a census o f reading ability in second grade. The target
for the Quality of Basic Education i s likely to be the achievement o f a specified improvement in the
percentage of children in second grade who can read 60 words a minute. The precise target w i l l be set in
consultation with the government and key stakeholders, following the availability o f the results o f the
base line and after undertaking a benchmarking exercise that would provide guidance o n how rapid an
improvement the country could hope to make.

1 11. Evaltiating the CPS. In addition to the efforts to promote a greater results orientation within the
country, the WBG i s taking steps to ensure that i t w i l l be possible to evaluate i t s o w n performance over
the CPS period. AS the CPS i s a partnership strategy, this involves first analyzing the country’s
17

.

This i s one of the important conclusions o f the RECURS0 study on accountability in the social sectors in Peru.

.24

performance and then attempting to judge how successful were WBG efforts to help the country achieve
i t s goals. Barring strong adverse shocks, it i s likely that successful progress in each o f the clusters w i l l
allow the country to reach the overarching goals o f sustained growth o f 5 percent or more per year and a
reduction o f poverty on the order o f 1.5 to 1.8 percentage points a year. The Results Annex (Table B.10)
identifies a set o f indicators and goals that w i l l be used to judge whether there has been successful
progress in the different clusters, These goals are government goals and achieving them w i l l depend
primarily and crucially on the government’s o w n policies, programs and actions and o n the nature o f
exogenous shocks. Given the limited scale o f the WBG’s activities compared with the government’s
o w n effort, the WBG role i s to support and contribute to the goals.

The flexibility that i s being built into the CPS makes i t impossible to define, ex ante, what the
112.
expected contribution o f WBG activities are to meeting goals o f the cluster. However, over the course o f
time, the specific WBG activities w i l l be defined - in response to client demand and their potential to
contribute to the cluster outcomes. Prior to initiating any activity-at
the project concept or initial
review-the task team leader would be asked to explain how the intended activity would be expected to
contribute to the goal o f the cluster. H e or she would also be asked to explain by what mechanism the
activity would be expected to contribute by: a) promoting dialogue around an issue or helping move an
issue higher up in the country’s agenda; b) demonstrating a possible solution to a problem; c) helping the
country figure out how best to take a promising approach to scale; or d) providing needed financing for a
necessary activity.’8 Once an activity i s completed, an implementation completion report will be
prepared. Thus, expost i t w i l l be possible to form judgments about the contributions o f the WBG to
success in the cluster.
At the end o f the period there w i l l be a CPS Completion Report. The evaluation o f WBG
113.
performance in the CPS Completion Report w i l l depend not just on the quality o f the work that was done,
but also in the quality o f the selection o f activities that were made. Given the problems in the country and
the WBG comparative advantages, did the WBG and the government make good decisions on what to
work on?
114.
Finally, to provide additional input to the CPS completion report and to generate increased
incentives for WBG staff to incorporate a results orientation in the activities that w i l l be introduced in the
implementation of the CPS, the WBG w i l l introduce opinion surveys o f key stakeholders designed to
measure how effective the WBG i s in what i t sets out to do. One client survey w i l l be conducted prior to
the CPS Progress Report and another prior to the CPS completion report. In those client surveys, key
stakeholders w i l l be asked to assess the effectiveness of the WB in terms o f the stated objective o f that
activity. Thus, ifthe particular activity, for example a piece o f AAA, was intended to influence the
debate around a certain topic, key stakeholders would be asked whether the AAA succeeded in
influencing the debate. The prospect o f having a client survey that assesses, even in a qualitative fashion,
how well the WBG has done should create some positive incentives to focus on results, to be explicit
about what the WBG i s trying to accomplish and to be more transparent and communicative in describing
how the WBG intends to help the country and what the results o f those efforts are.

F.

Consultations

115.
The consultation process for this CPS included a variety o f stakeholders, including
representatives o f the civil society, private sector, the donor community and government. One o f the
most important events was an all-day retreat held with members o f the incoming and outgoing
I t i s worth noting that W o r l d Bank financing i s small relative to the size o f the investment budget, the total budget
or GDP in Peru. Average annual disbursements o f investment and adjustment loans over the last 5 years represent
9.1 percent of the public investment budget, 1.6 percent o f the total government budget and 0.3 percent o f G D P in
2005. There may be some sub-sectors in which the absolute amount o f the WBG financing would be significant,
but, in general, the impact that the WBG will have i s likely to go beyond its financial contribution.

25

governments organized around a discussion o f a draft version o f the Policy Notes for Peru. This meeting
was held in late June, after the new government had been elected, but before they took office. There were
6 main consultations held with civil society. Given the importance o f widening benefits o f growth in the
CPS, the WB and IFC staff carried out consultations over 3 days in A with peasant entrepreneurs and
small businessmen coming from different parts o f the Southern Sierra. These consultations were led by
the Yachaqchics (“teachers/ facilitators o f knowledge” in Quechua) from Huancavelica, Huanuco,
Ayacucho, Apurimac, Cusco and Puno. (148 participants).” The topic o f the discussion was related to
“Good Practices and Income generation among the poor.” About 64 good practices were explained in the
consultation, The target audience was poor entrepreneurs from the Southern Highlands who had
experienced some progress due to their application o f good practices, but who s t i l l remained below the
poverty line and still required assistance from all relevant actors including the State.

A second meeting with civil society took place w i t h urban and rural entrepreneurs from C U ~ O Y I 116.
funded provinces in Cajamarca in the northeast o f Peru and was attended by around 50 participants.
Again, the focus was on identifying good practices and income generation amount the poor. A third,
more general, meeting was held in Lima with members o f community-based organizations, indigenous
groups, academia, media, think tanks, women associations, peasants’ cooperatives, NGOs, and other c i v i l
society organizations. A fourth meeting consisted o f a joint IFCiIBRD consultation exercise w i t h the
private sector that took place in Lima during the CPS preparation. There was a meeting held o n the CPS
with CIES, a consortium of universities and think tanks, and another with the WB youth advisory group
N e w Voices. Finally, there was a meeting to discuss the CPS with members o f the international
cooperation based in Lima.
117.
A group o f professional facilitators coordinated this process and a final report presenting the main
points o f the discussion w i l l be shared with all participants. Outcomes o f the consultations can be found
in Annex I.A total o f 600 participants were actively engaged in the dialogue. There was a widely held
view that the WBG could and should play an important role as a promoter o f dialogue on important
development issues in Peru. Many felt that strong external support from an independent source such as
the WBG can be u s e f u l in fostering dialogue and promoting key transparency and governance values.
G. Lessons Learned

118.
The implementation o f the previous CAS began during a period o f transition and after the Bank
had reduced i t s involvement in the country. The CAS strategy was aligned with the National Agreement,
which had broad national support. In hindsight, the focus on competitiveness, decentralization and social
sectors seems adequate, although a greater emphasis on anti-corruption could have benefited the country.
119.
CAS implementation helped Peru post achievements in a wide range o f areas, but most o f these
achievements are first steps that need to be consolidated in order to be effective. The most salient
achievement has been the solid and improved macroeconomic situation. The Bank’s contribution in this
area was significant, most useful perhaps in helping keep decentralization under the rule o f fiscal
neutrality. But the growth and fiscal prospects continue to be vulnerable to possible downturns in the
prices of minerals and internal expenditure pressures surrounding decentralization.

120.
The rest o f the program was relatively flexible and timely, focusing more on the creation o f
institutional building blocks rather than on permanent and sustainable results. Results have been varied.
Progress in diversifying the economy has been significant-measured
by dynamism o f the entrants
(products and firms) into the export markets. But greater expansion i s needed here for the country to be
prepared to deal with downturns in the prices o f raw materials, should they take place. Stronger
determination of the government and the private sector at national and regional levels w i l l be needed to
advance an effective competitiveness agenda.

The CAS focus on introducing innovations has been effective in utilizing the Bank’s comparative
advantage. The Bank has contributed with innovative ideas in a variety o f areas: infrastructure
guarantees, urban property rights, community participation, gradual decentralization, roads, technology,
and water. Some o f the successes were due to designs that responded to strong demand among
beneficiaries, as with urban property rights. Another contributing factor has been to figure out the
appropriate causal chain required to deliver on the intended results before designing or restructuring a
project. This has been the case o f the health project for instance, However, when the innovation requires
institutional change, the likelihood that political forces delay implementation increases, a factor that must
be taken into account early on in the design o f the project.
122.
Regarding programming and implementation, the experience during this last C A S period provides
the following lessons: (a) delays in the implementation of the investment program reduce i t s effectiveness
and can cramp the overall reform agenda; (b) the Bank may want to re-examine the use o f development
policy instruments to better deal with the inter-relationships across the reform agendas; (c) as the
institutional set-up comes into place, policy-based operations should be increasingly focused on
outcomes; (d) a focus on outcomes or results needs to be complemented with attention to delivery
mechanisms to be effective, (e) analytical work that nourishes the dialogue with government and i s
aligned with the overall development objectives has been effective; ( f ) when achieving results requires
multiple complementary interventions, designs have to take account o f these interconnections early on;
and (g) as the scope o f WBG engagement in Peru increases, the institution’s delivery capacity needs to be
buttressed, including tighter coordination between the members o f the WBG.
123.
The initial findings o f the consultations confirmed that a stronger attention to dialogue and
advocacy are key to multiply the effects o f WBG interventions. A joint strategic vision between I F C and
the Bank on civil society issues would integrate both institutions into the country’s development agenda.
For instance, the current advice on transparency and participation has not allowed reaching the most
vulnerable groups o f the population and increasing inclusion significantly. A rethinking o f the basic
instruments that are being recommended to reach the poor and vulnerable i s probably needed; including
the design and implementation o f alternative intervention instruments.
124.
The experience with RECURS0 has shown that when there i s a strong piece o f analytical work,
the impact of that work can be greatly enhanced if there i s an explicit dissemination and communication
strategy for the final product. The analysis of the CAS Completion report indicates that in the past Bank’s
projects in general have not paid enough attention to the importance o f strategic communication as a key
tool at the time o f designing projects. Some o f the actions that should be considered in the future
communication strategy would be to: a) use alternative means o f communications for dissemination and
supporting behavioral change; b) use simple but action oriented messages to support project preparation
and implementation; c) produce more user-friendly products for a broader audience: project results and
AAA main findings (videos, radio spots); and d) strengthen relationships with legislators and further
reach out to youth and university students.

125.
Private sector activity was supported through innovative transactions contributing to the
development o f local capital markets. Other private sector activities focused o n broadening access to
finance (notably microfinance), financing infrastructure projects (telecommunication and road
infrastructure), backing small and medium enterprises, integrating indigenous people into the formal
economy, and supporting the social sectors, particularly in private tertiary education geared to lower
income students.

H.

Donor Coordination

126.
The Bank has established close linkages with the donor community in Peru, including bilateral
and multilateral organizations. The most active partnerships have been established around certain policies
such as decentralization (through co-financing with KfW), education (together with IADB’s joint
program on rural education), transport (with the shared Lima Transport Project w i t h IADB), roads (with a

27

co-financing with IADB on rural transport) and health (in closed coordination w i t h the health program of
IADB). During the proposed CPS, the WBG will continue looking for the active participation of
numerous donors, as a way to enhance harmonization within the donor community and provide more
sustainability to the proposed set or reforms, An example o f the ample donor coordination the WBG has
given to this CPS was demonstrated with DFID’s co financing o f the consultation process o f the proposed
strategy.
127.
O n adjustment lending, KfW has expressed interest in cofinancing the proposed set o f fiscal
DPLs, as a continuation o f their initial support with the set o f D E C S A L loans disbursed during the former
administration. As well, the design o f the adjustment lending programs w i l l be closely coordinated w i t h
the IADB and the IMF, as both institutions are supporting the government’s public sector reform agenda.
At the same time, the Bank, w i l l continue to coordinate these tools with other donors (such as GTZ,
USAID, DFID, COSUDE, AECI, Cooperazione Italiana, SNV, etc), the same that w i l l continue to be
involved in supporting key reforms o f the new government. O n investment lending, the proposed strategy
under this CPS intends to have active coordination andor potential co financing with IADB (on transport,
education, health, fiscal management, competitiveness), with C A F (infrastructure), GTZ (on
competitiveness, water and rural development), JBIC (on infrastructure), U S A I D (on justice and
governance initiatives), DFID (nutrition). Additionally, the WBG w i l l continue to strengthen i t s
partnership with the Global Water & Sanitation Program, which has actively participated in the
consultations with the new government, and that w i l l be a complement to the WBG’s support to the
government’s “Agua para Todos ” program. Potential areas to do joint AAA could include infrastructure
(with CAF) and social sectors, growth generation and governance and anti corruption with DFID.
128.
The WBG w i l l continue playing a key role as a member o f the donor community throughout all
the thematic groups organized amongst donors. This includes coordination groups for decentralization,
justice modernization, education, health and rural development. An important task performed by the
Bank recently was the development o f a database tracking system to gather information throughout all the
non EU donors and share common information on our programs in the country. This effort was part o f
the Bank’s active role in the country’s harmonization agenda, which has also provided the first steps
toward results oriented blending initiatives in different sectors and with different actors. Together with
U N D P and the European Union the W B G w i l l continue to strengthen the harmonization principles within
the new government, which has received a lot o f attention from the new administration. The
government’s Agencia Perziana de Cooperucion Interizacional (APCI) has been a close partner o f the
WBG and given APCI’s expanded role i t i s expected that the present strategy under this CPS w i l l receive
a strong support.

CAF. In Peru, the C A F has been participating in public/private infrastructure projects and
129.
projects with sub-national governments. With the IADB, the C A F has been developing a project to build
capacity of regional governments in public administration. In addition, C A F i s working with other
financial institutions to implement projects on the efficient use o f mining canon resources, gold
production, productive development in areas where roads w i l l be built and on support o f the sectors that
are at a disadvantage with the signing of the U S FTA. During the past five years (2001-05) C A F
approved US$2.8 billions in operations for Peru - resulting in an average o f US$560 million per year.

130. IADB. In 2002 IADB established a Country Strategic Plan with the government to accomplish
two key objectives for the years to come: poverty reduction and promotion o f equity. In order to
accomplish them, the IADB considered three components in i t s lending programs for the country:
productivity and competitiveness, social policy efficiency, and modernization and decentralization.
During the last years the government has signed several commitments with the IADB. According to the
Ministry o f Economy and Finance, there have been 10 loan commitments throughout 2004-05. The most
important projects are concerned in eradicating poverty and improving government management. Both
projects represent more than 80 percent o f all disbursements. Other projects involve economic activities
such as training and access to markets, development o f local infrastructure, modernization o f local

28

institutions, improvement of basic facilities, etc. During the last couple o f years loan commitments have
exceeded US$600 million.

I.
Managing the Existing Portfolio
Peru i s an IBRD country (US$2,360 per capita income). The investment portfolio consists o f 16

Flow o f Investment and Adjustment

Peru’s lending portfolio has had on average 12 ongoing end-of-FY investment projects. The number o f
ongoing end-of-FY investment lending dropped from a high o f 14 projects in 00 to 8 projects by end-ofFY02. I t then picked up again, due in great part to the FY05 CAS Progress Report which shifted Peru to
the high case, back to 15 ongoing projects at end-of-FY06. Throughout this six year period, net
commitments averaged US$545 billion. Disbursement amounts from investment loans have averaged
US$40 million, with disbursement ratios being consistently higher than the 20 percent threshold until
FY04, and then dropping below to a 16 percent average after that. Overall disbursements have averaged
$190 m per FY since FY02. Portfolio performance indicators have been excellent throughout the period
and there are no pending cases o f alleged corruption in WB projects being investigated by INT in Peru.

IFC. As o f end-June 2006, IFC’s outstanding portfolio stood at US$198 million. In terms o f
132.
sectors, one third o f the portfolio was in food and beverage (36.4 percent), mostly in export-oriented
companies, followed by transportation (16.3 percent), tourism (1 1.3 percent), agribusiness (10.3 percent),
utilities (8.9 percent), and the financial sector (5.4 percent).
133.
MIGA. MIGA’s portfolio in Peru at the end o f FY06 involved guarantees o f US$78.9 million
accounting for 1.5 percent o f MIGA’s portfolio (1.7 percent o f portfolio net o f reinsurance). MIGA’s
exposure in Peru has fallen from a U S 2 9 7 . 5 million in FY02, due to attrition o f investment instruments
(amortization o f debt, repayment o f capital) o f the insured portfolio. Currently, 85 percent o f MIGA’s
outstanding exposure remains in the mining sector.
Implementation issues. During the last CAS period the main problems on the government side
134.
have been some weaknesses in strategic planning and programming o f public investments, tight fiscal
ceilings together with scarce counterpart funding and high turnover within the Bank’s main counterparts.
Even though the sectors’ demand for external debt financing increased, fiscal ceilings established by the
General Public Debt Law did not reflect the disbursement ceilings provided by the Multiannual
Macroeconomic Framework (MMM), and thus affected the sectors’ availability o f counterpart funding

29

,

required for project implementation. An additional bottleneck for project implementation i s related to the
use o f Bank’s procurement guidelines for those cases where Bank’s financing represent 60 percent or less
o f project expenditures. The application o f said rules has experienced some difficulties based on the
interpretation o f the National Procurement Law. However, the Bank and the government recognize this
could be a problem and through this CPS both w i l l be willing to work collaboratively to solve it.
135.
During the second half of the last CAS period, the WBG organized an internal Portfolio Quality
Team, comprising all the fiduciary officers, the Country Officer and the Country Manager w i t h the
purpose o f carrying out monthly portfolio reviews within this team. This w i l l be continued in the CPS
period and regular meetings o f this Portfolio Quality Team w i l l be held with MEF’s unit in charge o f
monitoring all public investments and with the different executing agencies and sector representatives.
This w i l l be above and beyond the regularly scheduled CPPRs.
136.
Application o f the new Bank policy on eligible expenditure w i l l also facilitate the implementation
o f Bank projects.*’ I t w i l l allow the Bank and the government to determine the cost-sharing ratio for
projects that best supports implementation while also retaining country ownership, sustainability o f
project achievements, and leveraging o f Bank funds. The changes are also expected to facilitate the
administration o f projects by reducing the need for the traditional pari-passu approach, because costsharing w i l l not have to be at the level o f individual expenditures. Project managers w i l l be able to focus
more on the technical aspects o f project implementation, rather than on financing categories. Thus, both
from an aggregate fiscal point o f view and the project implementation perspective, the Bank’s greater
flexibility in financing project costs w i l l help projects to meet their development objectives.
J.

Fiduciary Issues: Procurement a n d Financial Management

Procurement. In September 2005, the former government, the Bank and the IADB agreed on a
137.
new Country Procurement Assessment report (CPAR), which analyzed the current Peruvian system in the
context of international good practices in procurement and described the progress made towards
achievement o f such practices since the previous CPAR report in 2001. I t also assessed the potential risks
which may affect the continuity o f the procurement reform process in the near fiture and proposed
concrete actions aimed at increasing procurement capacity, reducing transaction costs and the costs o f
goods, works and services procured in the public sector.

138.
Since the 2001 CPAR, Peru has made considerable progress in setting in motion the right
conditions to improve public procurement. The primary regulator for procurement, the Council for
Government Procurement (CONSUCODE), has been strengthened; the development of the e-GP system
has begun; significant training initiatives are underway; and important amendments have been made to
the procurement law and i t s regulations. In addition, a good Integrated Financial Management System
(SIAF) has been implemented in all public sector entities.
139.
While not all planned anticorruption initiatives have been implemented and a more
comprehensive anticorruption strategy needs to be developed, the government i s more transparent than
ever and almost every government agency has a web page that includes wide ranging information about
agency activities. Freedom o f the press has increased dramatically and both corruption and transparency
are now part o f the policy dialogue.
140.
There i s s t i l l a high degree o f fragmentation in the system. With several institutions playing
important roles, defined by law, in public sector procurement, it has proven difficult to generate a
unifying vision of the system’s objectives and priorities. Moreover, the persistence o f inefficiencies o f
the procurement system i s compounded by the effects o f complex budgetary planning and execution rules
as well as logistic deficiencies, all of which result in slow service delivery. Due to strict budgetary rules

2o

For the required supporting note and a descriptive chart o f the proposed CFPs, see Annex J

30

and l o w technical capacities relative to procurement, some public entities are not able to fully execute
their budget, which further exacerbates the problem.
141.
There are significant variations in the capacity to administer procurement and procurement
practices have proliferated, particularly at the local government level. Peru began a process of
decentralization in 2002 that increased citizen participation. However, this task i s proving to be a
formidable challenge due to the large number o f local governments (there are 1,832 district
municipalities) and the poor programming, budget execution and low financial management capacity of
the same. There has been a significant training effort already, but more w i l l be required.
Financial Management. The last Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) report
142.
from 200 1 looked exclusively at Peru’s public sector financial accountability arrangements and i t s
primary aim was to assess strengths and weaknesses as they related to the use o f Bank funds, particularly
under non-investment lending operations. I t reviewed the legislative framework relevant to the current
reporting environment; the application o f appropriate accounting standards and reporting format;
competency o f financial staff; independent review o f financial operations and reports; the adequacy o f
financial management, as implied in financial accountability comprising cash management, planning,
control, and supervision o f financial operations. Findings and conclusions on the fiduciary framework
showed that, as shown by the independent verification o f the integrity fbnction assigned under the law,
the Supreme Audit Institution i s under-funded, while the history o f reviews by the C G R indicated a
failure to affect, or supervise the external control function in the Ministry o f Defense. Furthermore, audit
findings revealed that neither the Congress nor the public i s adequately informed on the state o f control in
the executive branch, suggesting performance auditing should be subject to a costbenefit analysis, and
discussed openly with Congress.

143.
The CFAA, conducted in 2001, concluded that the financial instruments available to the
Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch comprised the following: (a) ample legislation o n financial
administration; (b) highly qualified personnel; and (c) an integrated system o f financial administration
(SIAF). According to the CFAA, the government’s efforts to strengthen public finance administration
have focused on: (a) strengthening supervision o f the Legislative Branch’s use o f funds; (b) increasing the
independence of the General Controller’s Office o f the Republic (CGR) and strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework for the supervision o f public spending; and (c) expanding the scope and coverage
o f S I A F in the different levels o f government.
144.
Although Peru i s considered exemplary in the application o f public sector financial management
components, i t s fiduciary framework to support non-investment lending should, however, be strengthened
to include a plan to achieve a strong supreme audit institution to support the extension o f the integrated
financial management system to all ministries. T o ultimately support the uses o f funds advanced and the
external reporting on budget execution, further fine-tuning needs to be made at the program level, in
addition to restoring the control over Budget to the Congress, limiting the use o f Emergency Decrees, and
applying transparent guidelines for approved budget funding.
145.
Implementation of Country PFM Activities as a Follow-up to the last CFAA. Even though Peru
has been implementing the main C F A A 2001 recommendations, the three indispensable elements o f a
sound fiduciary framework remain weak: (a) a strong Congressional oversight; (b) an efficient Supreme
Audit Institution ( S A I ) ; and (c) effective P F M systems to ensure transparency and accountability in the
use of public financial information. Following the C F A A recommendations in line with the auditor’s
report on the General Accounts, the government tried to improve public perception o f the use o f P F M
systems,
146.
Action Plan. An update o f the 2001 C F A A i s urgently needed considering a new government
was recently elected and that this strategy would contribute and support the new public administration
arrangements. A Country Financial Management Strategy (CFMS) i s under preparation, highlighting the
need to fill the information gap generated after the C F A A was completed and to follow up o n the

31

outstanding issues o f the previous administration. I t w i l l propose that the government performs two sets
o f Bank Guided P F M Systems Self-Assessment using the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) Framework, with BRD assistance: (a) at the national level; and (b) at municipal
level (the provincial municipality of Lima, the most important Bank borrower at the local level in Peru).
These exercises w i l l provide a common platform for assessing and developing essential PFM systems by
providing a common pool o f information for measuring and monitoring P F M performance progress, as
well as support the government’s decentralization efforts. In the case o f Peru, i t w i l l include the country’s
oversight environment, accountability and transparency policies and achievements, and reliability of
country information systems. The Bank Guided Self-Assessment would enhance the sentiment of
ownership contributing to better improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f the government’s efforts to
use public funds to reduce poverty. These self-assessments would give the government and IBRD an
opportunity to review various fiduciary aspects at the national level and at the most important local
government P F M systems. The investment portfolio would benefit directly from these Bank Guided SelfAssessments as they w i l l complement the action plan to strengthen the fiduciary framework. During the
preparation o f each project, the Bank w i l l review the progress in the implementation o f the action plans
and the PEFA Bank Guided Self-Assessment. The present strategy proposes the use o f PEFA indicators
as a reference for implementation and programming o f the CPS program. Thus, i t might identify
additional actions required by specific sector or project issues.

147. The financial management strategy under preparation suggests the following activities to
contribute reducing the weaknesses presented in the last C F A A as part o f the C A S action plan: (a)
Strengthening of the congressional oversight o f the use o f public funds; (b) increasing independence and
strengtheningthe institutional capacity o f the SAI, the Peru Controller General (CGR); and (c) expansion
of the scope and coverage of the integrated financial management system SIAF, in order to increase
accountability and transparency and to strengthen anticormption measures and procedures.
V.

RISKS

148. While the overall outlook i s positive, Peru does face several risks. One o f the most important
risks i s social. If the underlying factors that led to the social discontent manifest in the last election are
not addressed quickly, there could be increased social conflict. There can also be social conflict triggered
by groups interested in a single issue-coca or mining, for example. Whatever the source o f social
conflict, there i s a risk o f entering a vicious circle. Social conflict would lead to lower private investment
which, in turn, would lower growth and imply that there would be fewer resources to address the social
concerns. There could be several factors that might explain why the underlying factors might not be
addressed quickly enough. One possibility i s that the political interest in attacking the problem may wane
once the election has passed. This seems unlikely, given the strong commitment that this administration
has given to balancing economic and social development. Another possibility i s that the government may
have difficulty delivering results. This i s a risk since there are some sectors at the national level where
implementation capability i s l o w and the country i s entering a period o f increased decentralization where
many municipalities have l o w capacity. The government i s taking steps to mitigate these risks. In
addition to some steps to improve implementation capacity (such as the introduction o f decentralized
offices o f the National Investment Program), the government has launched an “Znvestment Shock”
directed to the poorest sections o f the country and a required set o f administrative simplification measures
to increase infrastructure investments to meet basic needs for the poor. This effort should be
complemented by measures to expand social services and to strengthen the justice and governance
framework. This w i l l require a strong focus on implementation within the government and with the WBG
programs. Finally, the social groups may have unrealistic expectations regarding how fast the problems
can be resolved. This would have to be managed by making it abundantly clear that the government i s
working actively on trying to solve the problems.

32

149.
O n the same order o f magnitude as the social risks are the external risks. A similar vicious circle
could be generated by an external shock in the form o f a dramatic reduction in commodity prices or a
strong El Niiio effect. Additionally, Peru i s considered to be among the most likely to suffer the effects of
climate change in the near future. While the initial impetus for falling into a vicious circle would be
different, once the fall occurs the dynamics would be the same and it would be difficult to escape. An
additional external risk i s a possible delay (or even outright rejection) o f the FTA by the U S Congress.
Beyond the actual quantitative damage that this would do the economy, this could create a lack o f
confidence both internally and externally in the recent direction o f economic policies. T o mitigate this
risk, the government has already embarked on a lobbying plan for the FTA. However, the approval o f the
FTA plan depends more on internal politics within the U S than on actions that could be undertaken by
Peru.
In addition to the social and external risks, there are some lesser risks-that o f a departure from
150.
strong macro fundamentals and general political risks. The history o f the first Garcia presidency led to
some doubts as to the relative weight that the new administration would give to the need to maintain
macro stability versus the need to increase investment to address some o f the Peru’s social problems.
W i t h the initial actions o f President Garcia (particularly his naming a strong technical team in the MEF),
the risk o f a departure from the strong macro fundamentals i s considered to be lower now than before the
elections. However, there are some key measures that, albeit politically risky, are much needed to ensure
success o f the government’s plan and to reduce economic vulnerabilities. These are related to the long
awaited tax reform to consolidate i t s fiscal stance and to the dedollarization o f the economy, given the
current low revenueiGDP ratio and the currency mismatches.

15 1.
The government i s taking advantage o f the relatively favorable external conditions to reduce i t s
vulnerabilities. The government i s attempting to improve i t s capability to respond to these risks by
improving debt management (providing a greater opportunity to run countercyclical policies) policies and
the possible use o f available commodity price hedges) and by launching an austerity campaign to reduce
the percentage of fixed expenditures within the budget which i s currently quite high. The longer the
favorable external conditions prevail and the more persistent that Peru i s in reducing vulnerabilities, the
better Peru i s likely to react to an adverse external shock when i t inevitably occurs. Once an external
shock occurs, it would undoubtedly be necessary to curtail the rate o f increase o f current and investment
spending, as well as to modify the rate at which the debt/GDP ratio declines. The advances in
transparency of the budget should also help the government convince the public o f the rationale for the
policies that it would need to take in response to a shock.
152.
One of the political risks i s a possible widespread turnover o f public sector employees, with the
replacements selected more for their political affiliation than for their technical competence. The strong
push that the Ministry of Economy and Finance i s making on results-based management should provide
greater incentives to maintain or select staff that has technical competence to deliver results. An even
stronger incentive i s the recognition by APRA and President Garcia that, having received an
unprecedented second chance, history w i l l judge them by the impact they have had in the country. A
second political risk i s a potential difficulty in governing with a fragmented Congress. At the time o f the
presidential elections in June, it appeared that there were very good chances that Congress would be
highly conflictive. Today, it appears that there w i l l still be an active opposition, but there w i l l not be an
unworkable number o f small parties and there w i l l be more opportunities to find compromises.

Private Sector Strategy
Introduction
Peru has made significant progress in promoting private sector Laelopment. Fueled by the private
sector, the economy i s experiencing an unprecedented period o f growth. Macroeconomic stability has
been strengthened to the point that entrepreneurs do not see inflation or changes in foreign currency
regulations as a relevant problem hindering their economic activity in Peru (Figure 1). Crime and
theft have decreased, providing a safer business environment. Moreover, the recent smooth
democratic transition has created a window o f opportunity for reducing political instability, perceived
as the main deterrent to private investment - according to the Global Competitiveness Report 20052006 (GCR), entrepreneurs perceived political instability as the main obstacle to doing business in
Peru. High standards have been reached in the regulation o f protecting investors, property registry
and obtaining credit (Figure 2). Over the last four years, Peru has been the highest performer among
developing countries in the region in GDP growth and, according to Doing Business 2007 (DB), Peru
ranks among the top ten reformers.

Note: F r o m a list o f 14 factors, respondents were asked to select the five most problematic for doing business in
the country and to rank them between 1 (most problematic) and 5 (least problematic. The bars in the figure
show the responses weighted according to their rankings.

Nonetheless, the need remains for deepening reforms and promoting a more dynamic private sector
environment. Peru still ranks poorly in terms o f labor regulation, tax regulation, dealing with licenses,
contract enforcement and trading across borders (Figure 2). Peruvian policy makers recognize that a
vibrant private sector - with f i r m s investing, creating jobs, and improving productivity - i s central to
promoting growth and expanding opportunities for poor people. In addition, the prompt conclusion o f
a trade agreement with the U S i s especially inportant because i t provides a window o f opportunity to
further generate export growth in labor-intensive industries; a strong private sector i s better able to
take advantage o f such an opportunity.
Peru also faces the challenge that despite economic progress o f the past five years, the rate of poverty
has scarcely improved over the same period. Fifty percent o f the population s t i l l lives in poverty,
with twenty-five percent the population living in extreme poverty. As in many countries o f the
54

region, social and income inequalities poise a threat to political stability as w e l l as to long-term
sustainable growth, The presidential election results reflected the potential o f this split across the
country, with President Alan Garcia winning in the more prosperous areas o f L i m a and in the north,
but losing the votes in the highlands and the Amazon region to an anti-system candidate (Ollanta
Humala) in what was widely perceived as a reflection o f the populous' feeling o f exclusion and
dissatisfaction with the ability o f the traditional political system to deliver economic benefits to all.
In this context, the Government intends to address these challenges with a focus o n (i)
economic
growth through improving the business environment, investing in physical infrastructure, improving
access to finance and basic services, and rendering growth more environmentally and socially
sustainable; (ii)
the expansion o f social development by emphasizing education, health and social
assistance; and (iii)
the modernization o f the State by decentralizing authority, building capacity to
deliver services efficiently and improving governance.

World Bank Group Private Sector Strategy (PSS) Objectives
In support o f the 3 pillars o f the CPS, the WBG PSS w i l l place a particular focus o n areas whereby a
closer coordination within the WBG w i l l address key private sector issues, government priorities, and
effective poverty reduction. Peru i s a middle income country. This PSS draws upon the
recommendations from the report entitled "Strengthening the World Bank's Engagement with IBRD
Partner Countries", and recently discussed at the Development Committee Meeting in September
2006 (Report SecM2006-035411).

WBG Value added - Middle Income Countries (MICs) stress the need for stronger support from
Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) for improving the business environment; the importance o f
MDB funding mechanisms for the private sector and o f public-private partnerships in infrastructure
financing as a mechanism to promote private investment; and a need to enhance the private sector's
awareness o f products offered by the MDBs.

The private sector plays a central role in the development o f MIC's such as Peru, in driving growth
and j o b creation, as well as reducing poverty. Enabling the private sector requires the combined
efforts o f governments and private actors. Thus i t i s increasingly important for the IBRD, I F C and
MIGA, to work closely in supporting Peru's development.
Focus on Cooperation. WBG support for private sector development focuses o n two tasks.
Governments need to ensure a sound investment and regulatory environment that includes good
governance and provides physical and social infrastructure. There i s a growing role for governments
and the private sector to work together in public-private partnerships in infrastructure and delivery o f
public services. While IBRD concentrates on the first task and I F C i M I G A on the second, the WBG
w i l l work together to enhance the effectiveness o f the overall support to Peru's development. IFC's
and MIGA's knowledge o f foreign investors i s already informing IBRD support for improving the
private sector environment, and i s an essential component o f WBG country partnership strategies.
Over this CPS period, greater integration o f WBG country support i s expected to translate into more
effective WBG cooperation at the project and global program levels. Enhanced WBG cooperation i s
one of the key strategic goals o f IBRD, IFC and MIGA, and efforts are underway to monitor the
levels o f cooperation.
IBRD Value Added - I B R D ' s strategy with respect to the private sector development involves the
strengthening and development o f the domestic financial sector in order to ensure both the country
macroeconomic stability and the access to financial services to underserved segments o f the society,
such as micro, small, and medium enterprises, which fosters domestic investment and thus economic
55

growth. The IBRD, through targeted technical assistance and Development Policy Lending, assists
the country authorities to both identify the obstacles to sustainable financial deepening, and to
delineate and implement key policy actions.
IFC Value Added - IFC’s mandate i s to foster private sector development that reduces poverty and
improves people’s lives. This i s accomplished through investment and technical assistance. Technical
assistance frequently complements IFC investment interests. However, there exist a large number of
economic sectors, particularly in frontier countries in Latin America, but also in M I C s such as Peru,
that do not qualify for investment due to a lack o f size, sector sophistication, and/or potential for
significant return. However, these sectors and associated M S M E s can also play an important role in
reducing poverty. In addition, a historical lack o f support to these non-sophisticated sectors may help
to explain the current disillusionment with development efforts in Peru that points to income
inequalities and to the fact that development projects with large f i r m s have not “trickled-down’’ to
yield economic benefits. Supporting these sectors extends IFC’s reach and credibility, focuses on the
settings which best facilitate M S M E growth and health, strengthens certain sectors for future I F C
investment, and promotes equitable regional economic growth and democracy.
During the previous CAS period, IBRD has supported the government’s efforts in fostering the
a comprehensive financial sector assessment
sound development of financial markets through (i)
led with the IMF in early 2005, which provided the government w i t h a roadmap o f actions (ii)
FIRST-funded technical assistance to re-design the governmental tool for housing finance Fondo
MiVivienda (FMV) (iii)
FIRST-funded ongoing technical assistance to promote the development of
innovative capital markets funding alternatives for MSMEs. Targeted analytical work was also
provided in the areas o f public debt management and credit reporting infrastructure. IBRD i s also
supporting increased competitiveness in the private sector through (i)a trade competitiveness
investment loan and (ii)
a guarantee facility for PPPs in infrastructure projects.
IFC Strategy implementation under the last CAS - Private sector activity was supported through
innovative transactions contributing to the development o f local capital markets. Other private sector
activities focused on broadening access to finance (notably microfinance), financing infrastructure
projects (telecommunication and road infrastructure), backing small and medium enterprises,
integrating indigenous people into the formal economy, and supporting the social sectors, particularly
in private tertiary education geared to lower income students.

IFC’s activity in Peru was consistent with the strategy set out in the previous CAS. IFC’s strategy
was centered around five themes: - (i)the financial sector (micro-finance institutions and target
financing supporting the growth o f the mortgage market); (ii)infrastructure, to enhance
competitiveness; (iii)
direct investment in the j o b producing real and service sectors (manufacturing,
tourism, agribusiness, and social sectors); (iv) sustainable development and capacity building (natural
resources) sector and (v) administrative simplification and investment climate work.
IFC committed US$247 million in 14 projects, including US$8 million from participating banks. As
o f June 2006, IFC’s committed portfolio stood at US$271 million for IFC’s o w n account and an
additional $US 14 million from participating banks. The financial sector, food and beverages, and
transportation and warehousing account for the larger part. Currently, one third o f IFC’s portfolio i s
in food and beverage (36.4%) mostly in export-oriented companies, followed by transportation
(16.3%), tourism (11.3%), agribusiness (10.3%), utilities (8.9%), and the financial sector (5.4%).

The W o r l d Bank Group Private Sector Strategy
I B R D / I F C collaboration - The IBRD and I F C have taken a focused approach to this collaboration
and have identified specific areas of synergy which are featured below. Staff o f IBRD and I F C have
also worked out some practical approaches to foster collaboration. For example, I F C w o u l d
participate as peer reviewers in relevant IBRD operations and there would be some joint Economic
and Sector Work (ESW) carried out.

IBRD/IFC areas of synergies and/or convergence in support of the private sector can be found
in each of the three pillars (discussed in the main text):
0
Pillar I- Economic Growth: Deepening o f local capital markets, Infrastructure financing,
Rural Development, Improving the Business Environment, and Development in the Sierras.
0
Pillar I1 - Social Development: Improving access to water and sanitation, Improving access

to housing, Support to Higher Education
Pillar I11 - Modernization o f the State: Municipal Governance, Corporate Governance o f
state-owned enterprises, Decentralization & capacity building (Canon Minero).

The IBRD will accompany the government’s priorities in financial and private sector
development through a series o f programmatic Fiscal Management and Competitiveness DPLs that
foster formality and M S M E growth, (ii)
increase the resiliency
w i l l have among its objectives to (i)
and depth o f the banking system, and (iii)
promote longer term local currency investment and savings
vehicles.

I F C Strategy in Peru
I F C has developed a strategy which i s integrated w i t h the program o f the IBRD and that supports the
development path outlined above by the new government. This strategy will be implemented by
focusing our activities on:

tackling Peru’s high informality w i t h technical assistance which helps municipalities simplify
the business process registration and encourages other reforms to strengthen the investment
climate.
investing and developing projects which address bottlenecks to provision of basic services and
physical infrastructure - directly improving the living standards o f poorer segments o f the
population, including in the rural areas.
investing in industries w i t h strong competitive advantages such as agribusiness, and tourism.
expanding growth to new beneficiaries by providing access to SME, housing, and tertiary
education finance and by building local government capacity to deliver services - directly
improving the opportunities and living standards o f poorer segments o f the population.
supporting environmentally and socially sustainable growth - broadening the benefits from
Peru’s mineral and natural resources.

IFC’s implementation w i l l involve balancing its support among large companies, microenterprises
and SMEs, among investments and technical assistance. Our technical assistance programs in Peru
complement and leverage our investment operations by bringing o n value added and improving the
enabling environment for stronger private sector development in the country.

1. Tackling Informality and Promoting Reforms that Strengthens the Investment Climate.
Doing Business Peru. A series o f bureaucratic constraints are hindering the development o f the
private sector. DB data highlight that Peru ranks poorly in terms o f contract enforcement, starting a
business, dealing w i t h licenses and trading across borders. 201 days are needed for dealing with a

57

license in Peru, 40 percent more than in Mexico. The cost for enforcing a contract i s equivalent to 35
percent o f the debt, twice as much as in Argentina and Chile. The heavy regulatory framework could
explain, at least in part, why corruption i s perceived as the third constraint to doing business in Peru
(see Figure 1, above). Tax regulation i s perceived by entrepreneurs as a constraint to their economic
activity, as important as inadequate infrastructure and more important than labor regulation. Peru has
among the heaviest tax regulation in the world - according to DB, Peru i s ranked 135"' among 175
countries. Finally, the Peruvian labor regulation continues to be one o f the most cumbersome in the
world: Peru ranks 158'" among 175 countries according to DB.
IFC i s committed to informing governments about bureaucratic barriers that hamper economic
growth, decrease transparency and increase incentives to informality. In Peru, dissemination o f the
annual results o f the Doing Business report has been an effective way to raise the profile o f key issues
in the business environment with the Government and the Private Sector. The L A C Technical
Assistance Facility has ensured wide distribution and press coverage o f the Doing Business Results in
Peru and uses this as a starting point for further discussions with policy makers o n needed
improvements to the investment climate.
Bureaucratic Simplification. Based o n the Doing Business Results, the L A C Technical Assistance
Facility has developed operational solutions to some o f the most pressing reforms needed to decrease
informality and increase competitiveness.
The L i m a Municipal Simplification Pvogvanz has
identified municipal regulations in Lima and their constraints to business growth. The success o f this
program has led to i t s current expansion nation-wide. The nationalization plan has the support o f 25
institutions, ranging from central Government institutions (including various ministries) and
municipal governments to business associations and international development agencies. The
Administration has praised the plan for i t s potential to reduce corruption and promote transparency. In
parallel, the L A C Municipal Scorecard program i s carrying out a benchmarking o f municipal
business regulations and w i l l be featured in the Doing Business outreach. I t aims at increasing
awareness o f regulatory inefficiencies at municipal level.

2. I m p r o v i n g Basic Services a n d Physical Infrastructure
Peru has a huge gap in infrastructure, with the Government spending 1% o f GDP where 3-4% i s
needed to support current growth rates. The Government w i l l not be able to meet this increase in
spending on i t s own, and private sector financing i s required. Unfortunately, this investment has not
been as robust as needed. Despite these difficulties, IFC has been successful in supporting
infrastructure financing, (16% o f IFC portfolio in transport and 9% in utilities).
However, the
challenge for the Corporation going forward w i l l be to find new ways to boost badly needed private
sector investment in key infrastructure, particularly roads, ports, and airports. Different modalities o f
public-private partnerships seem to be the viable way forward and lessons can be derived from
several experiences with infrastructure concessions in Peru over the last 15 years. In general these
have been positive, with improvements in both usage and efficiency under private management. This
i s an area where work across the WBG w i l l be critical to put in place the needed risk sharing,
regulatory environment and incentives to increase the number o f infrastructure projects that are
successfully developed and implemented.
Developing Transport and Logistics. Currently, in transport infrastructure I F C has an investment o f a
concession section o f the Pan-American Highway (Nowial), where i t co-financed together with IADB
the Lima-Huacho-Pativilca toll-road concession Red V i a l 5, one o f the only two privately financed
highways in Peru. In railroads, IFC has an existing investment in FTSNPeru-rail and i s currently
closing an expanded facility with this company to finance their cargo operations serving the Cerro
Verde mine expansion. In logistics, IFC repeated an investment with the client Ransa to expand their
warehouse facilities. In telecoms, TIM Peru expanded the G S M cellular network throughout the
country, with significant benefits to local businesses.

58

Looking forward, IFC w i l l continue to explore additional investment opportunities in both transport
and logistics areas including: (i)
Transport: IFC has provided a L o 1 to Protransporte (the L i m a urban
transport concession program) and i s awaiting the process launch and winning bidders to seek
investment opportunities. IFC i s reviewing investment needs and eligibility o f Peru's top long-haul
bus company, Expreso Cruz del Sur and has also pursued investment possibilities with new airlines
and operators as these new entrants establish themselves; (ii)
Highways; I F C has actively sought to
invest in Red V i a l 6, and i s awaiting winning bidders for upcoming concessions Red V i a l 1 and 4;
(iii)
Ports; Proinversion has recently awarded the winning concession to Dubai Ports for the Muelle
Sur o f Puerto del Callao and IFC has indicated i t s availability and interest to finance the needed
investments. IFC.will also look at regional ports - to be granted under concession - on a case by case
basis; (iv) Airports: Lima Airport Partners, IFC i s engaged in active discussions around support for
their 2007-2008 capital expenditures program as well as a long-term partnership, and; (v) Logistics:
IFC i s pursuing an opportunity in storage and logistic facilities to support Lima's airport.
Electricity.
By and large the situation o f the electricity sector in Peru i s satisfactory, with good technical and
adequate financial performance. Despite progress, the extremely l o w electrification coverage in rural
areas i s still a major constraint in Peru. A t 35% coverage, this i s one o f the lowest rural electrification
rates in Latin America. Another issue o f concern i s the need to secure adequate investment levels,
taking into account the present rate o f the annual growth o f the demand o f about 4.5-5.0%. Again,
the level o f private sector investment in the industry has been relatively limited. (Almost 50% o f the
market i s state-owned). During the 2001-2004 period, the average investment in generation per year
has been only US$60 million, of which U S 2 5 million came from the private sector.

IFC has one active investment in the power sector in Pem, the ISA-Peru transmission line. In 2003,
IFC provided a US$18 million A Loan and a US$8 million B loan to finance the construction o f the
project. The project was a 32-year concession to build, o w n and operate two high voltage
transmission lines (ISA Peru, S A ) . The first transmission line links Pucallpa, Peru's most significant
town in the Amazon region, to the national power grid. Energy from the national grid carried over
this line w i l l displace more expensive thermal generation in the currently isolated system o f Pucallpa.
The second transmission line reinforces power supply to the high-load mining centers in central Peru
and completes an alternative route for transmitting electricity to Lima, the country's main source o f
demand for electricity, thereby reducing technical losses and improving the overall reliability o f the
national grid.
Currently IFC i s evaluating other opportunities in the Peruvian power sector. Specifically, I F C i s
targeting early investment in smaller hydro where i t s technical due diligence, stamp o f approval and
social and environmental assistance provide competitive advantages. IFC i s also targeting gas
distribution opportunities which can be used for stand alone power generation or for direct
commercial and residential uses. Both these sub-sectors are based on renewable or carbon friendly
resources that would provide high developmental impact to the country.
Water and Sanitation. By 2004, water and sanitation coverage in Peru reached 76 and 57 percent
respectively, much lower than the regional average i7f 89 and 74 percent. Similarly, the 23 percent
coverage for the treatment o f used waters i s far from the 72 percent reached by Chile. Furthennore
government studies show that expenditures by the poor o n water constitutes a significant
amount o f their total basic needs expenditures. Where services do exist, their quality i s poor:
urban areas are affected by l o w service continuity and a lack o f maintenance o f the infrastructure. In
rural areas, the quality o f water i s below standards - about 59 percent o f the rural area systems do not
have disinfection systems - and the sustainability o f services i s not ensured. This poor performance

59

'

results from the poor financial situation and a lack o f adequate governance in the majority o f
operators. Tackling this problem i s one o f the Governments key priorities and i s highlighted in i t s
180 day plan.
I F C has several instruments that it i s using to address this issue including advisory work and
financing o f water concessions, strengthening a current project on corporate governance for the stateowned Lima water company Sedapal, and launching a joint IFCiBank project on expanding water
connections in poor urban areas. All these projects are in the formative stages, but are anticipated to
have a significant developmental impact o n the accessibility and sustainability o f water and sanitation
services in Peru.

3. Investing in Industries with Strong Competitive Advantages
Improving Competitiveness in Agribusiness. From being pure importer o f agriculture products, Peru
has become a pure exporter. This “new agribusiness” i s responsible for a diversification in Peru’s
exports and for a l o w unemployment rate in the coastal agricultural regions, where the application of
drip irrigation has been a key technological component making this possible. This non-traditional
exporting sector o f products like asparagus, paprika, mangoes, organic bananas, organic coffee and
grapes covers about 80,000 productive hectares and involved a little over 50,000 producers and
accounts for almost two thirds o f the agricultural GDP. IFC recognized early the potential o f this
“miniboom” and was one o f the pioneers in supporting the diversification and competitiveness o f the
agriculture sector. A US$23 million commitment, including a US$15 million loan helped Agrokasa
diversify into this growth area and increase i t s asparagus exports and i t s nascent production o f
avocados. Another U S $ 7.5 million partial credit guarantee to Drokasa supported a US$25 million
bond issuance enabling productivity improvements within the company and i t s productive and
distributive networks.

I F C has also helped increase the domestic production o f sugar, where Peru i s a net importer. The
agriculture o f traditional crops (rice, coffee, sugar cane and cotton) for export or domestic
consumption/ subsistence covers more than 2.6 million hectares and over 3.2 million producers and
has not adequately been developed. IFC has invested in 2 sugar producers, with a U S $ 3 0 million loan
to the Paramonga company (US$15 A loan and U S S l 5 B loan) and a US$15 million loan (US$lO
million A loan and US$5 million C loan) to Laredo including a pending U S $ 1 9 million A loan
investment for expansion.
I F C w i l l keep seeking opportunities to promote the development o f the agricultural sector on the
coast, with a challenge o f making an impact in the much underdeveloped Sierra. There i s little to no
large scale agribusiness in the Sierra, with most production being done by subsistence farmers or
small cooperatives. IFC plans to cooperate with the IBRD on a pilot program within Sierra
Exportadora that would provide financing and technical assistance to farmers who are ready to scaleup and access export markets. Wherever possible, IFC’s strategy in “new agribusiness” will involve
other IFC products and services where we may contribute towards the gaining o f efficiency and
competitiveness in Peru’s agricultural sector. For example, IFC i s supporting a GEF funded initiative
for the application o f innovative technology and techniques in sugar cane harvesting equipment that,
ifsuccessful, w i l l increase sugar production as a result o f improved sucrose content while at the same
time sequestering carbon emissions by avoiding the typical burning o f the fields at the time o f
harvesting. IFC will also explore opportunities related to Ethanol production from Yuca.
Pronzoting Tourism. Peru has a huge potential to develop a thriving tourist industry. With the
combination o f breathtaking natural resources and unique archeological sites, Peru has the basis for
expanding i t s nascent tourism industry. At least 80% o f the tourists visiting Peru go to Cuzco and
60

Machu Picchu. The Cuzco-Machu Picchu axis i s clearly the main driving force behind the tourism
industry in Peru, an area in which Peru has competitive advantages. I F C has directly supported the
development o f hotel infrastructure in this area through an investment in a local hotel operator that
has 2 properties in the area and through a US$10 million loan to finance the renovation and debt
rescheduling o f the international Orient Express Hotel Chain in Machu Picchu.
There are however many under exploited tourism areas, including the Northern coastal areas and the
huge Amazon region along the Brazilian border. The largest obstacles to this development are the
lack o f infrastructure (roads, air transport, airports) and social and environmentally sustainable
projects. This makes it very difficult to attract investment for hotels. Our work could be expanded to
these areas, but this w i l l require a combination o f TA work building capacity and value chains, and
infrastructure investments to create an environment conducive, for tourist investments. For example,
to address social sustainability issues, in a current investment the I F C L A C Facility developed a pilot
program w i t h the hotel chain to link two hotel sites and a r a i l line to local small business producers,
service providers and the local community. This project i s increasing local incomes through programs
linking local agricultural producers to contracting opportunities w i t h the hotel. This model, along w i t h
our investments in infrastructure, presents an opportunity for I F C to be an early mover in the
development a sustainable tourism industry in Peru.

4. Expanding Growth to New Beneficiaries
Expanding the number o f Peruvians that benefit from Peru’s continued economic growth i s one o f the
biggest challenges facing the country and i s high on the Government’s list o f priorities. I F C i s
addressing this need by focusing investments through financial institutions to reach small and
medium businesses, increase the availability o f housing finance, especially for lower economic
groups and increase the access o f students to higher education. In addition, IFC’s Technical
Assistance Facility i s working w i t h Municipal Governments and community groups to build the
capacity o f each to ensure that local revenue streams (particularly coming from extractive industry
royalties) are spent transparently, efficiently and effectively to the benefit o f the local communities.

Increasing Access to Finance. IFC has direct investments and provides technical assistance to the
microfinance market in Peru. I t i s actively engaged w i t h 3 microfinance institutions through (i)
a
US$29 m i l l i o n senior loan to Mibanco, (ii)a US$4.0 m i l l i o n loan, including US$l.O m i l l i o n
convertible, to Edpyme Edyficar ($2.25 million outstanding), and; (iii)a US$ 2.4 m i l l i o n local
currency loan to Edpyme Confianza. In 2005, IFC approved a technical assistance program to
strengthen operational efficiencies in Edyficar through its L i m a facilities.
IFC’s greatest challenge in the area o f microfinance i s how to expand its impact into the rural areas,
where access to finance i s badly needed but there are few private institutions operating. Creative
public-private partnership structures may be needed to leverage the existing networks o f Municipal
and Rural “Cajas” (local government banks) or incentives developed to increase the level o f lending
of existing banks and microfinance institutions into these underserved areas.
Opportunities for IFC exist in developing programs around the clients o f our existing portfolio o f
microfinance institutions that tie in w i t h IBRD initiatives and Government priorities. For example,
I F C has started an initiative to help MiBanco provide an outreach and training program to recipients
of the W o r l d Bank’s titling program to teach them how they can use their titles as collateral for
housing and small business loans.

Developing Housing Finance. Access to housing i s a high priority o f the government. I F C prior
investments toward promoting the sector included a US$ 40 m i l l i o n warehouse loan to support Banco
61

Internacional del Peru ’s mortgage lending operations and i t s planned mortgage-backed securitization
program. Looking forward, IFC seeks to provide further support for development o f the sector in
Peru by drawing on i t s experience in other countries in the region, particularly Colombia and Mexico.
Considering the lack of penetration o f the mortgage market in Peru, IFC’s role o n the investment side
o f i t s business will be to: (i)increase access to finance by increasing the availability o f long-term

funding for mortgage on-lending by Peruvian banks; (ii)support capital market development by
investing in the secondary mortgage market conduit; (iii)participate in M B S structured deals,
providing credit enhancement.

I F C has 2 investments in i t s pipeline to support this strategy: (i)
Titzilarizadora Periiana, which w i l l
assemble pools o f mortgages and securitize them, support the primary mortgage market by providing
needed long-term funding, and promote the establishment and development o f the secondary
mortgage market, This project brings an IFC client from Colombia together with the largest bank in
Peru to jumpstart this effort; (ii)
BBVA credit line, i s designed to support Peru’s second largest bank
in increasing the availability o f i t s mortgage financing product to lower economic groups by
providing expansion capital for i t s housing finance division. In addition to i t s direct investments in
this area, IFC w i l l be working closely with the World Bank who has a program with the governmental
agency MiVivienda to expand government supported housing projects. (For example Titularizadora
Peruana may buy part o f their existing portfolio to provide liquidity for new investments).
Expanding Access to Higher Education. Peruvian tertiary education has undergone significant
changes in recent years. The public sector has expanded and diversified and the number o f private
providers has increased dramatically. By regional standards Peru has been relatively successful in
accommodating the increased demand. However, accomplishments in ternis o f equity and quality are
substandard. Inequities have worsened between 1997 and 2001. About 44 percent o f the enrolled
students belong to the richest 20 percent o f the population, whereas the poorest 40 percent make up
just 11 percent o f the student body and there i s l o w availability o f student financial assistance.
In support o f equitable development, IFC has invested in projects promoting increased education
opportunities and the inclusion o f marginalized groups into the formal economy. IFC initiated a loan
in 2004 in education: a partial guarantee backing a US$10 million local-currency bond ( U S 3 0
million equivalent) issued by the Universidad de Sun Martin Porres. The proceeds o f this operation
went into installation upgrades at the university, which caters to middle- and lower-class students who
often do not have access to public universities. In the future, IFC w i l l notably look into financing

initiatives that improve the quality and increase access to higher education. Potential areas may
include student loan scheme with private local banks and, depending o n the initiative o f the Peruvian
Government, may support PPPs in the sector.

Building Capacity to Ensure Local BeizeJitsfronz Municipal Revenues. Decentralization o f revenue
management and provision o f services i s one o f the hall marks o f the new Government’s programs.
However, the capacity to transform these new revenue streams into useful municipal investments,
especially in regions which benefit from the Canon Minera (which directs 50% o f royalty revenue
from extractive industries), has dramatically lagged behind. This has further increased the popular
feeling o f disenfranchisement and cynicism about the effects o f large private investments in the
country’s poorest regions.

I F C i s addressing this challenge through i t s Technical Assistance Facility which i s assisting local
municipalities in managing funds available from the Canon Minera and in disseminating information
o n the Canon in order to increase transparency and accountability. An example o f the impact o f IFC’s
intervention i s reflected in the reforms introduced by the Mayor o f Los Baiios del Inca, which have
produced significant results. Total investment has more than doubled in each o f the last two fiscal
62

years and i s on i t s way to do so again in 2006. The gap between Mining Canon revenues and actual
municipal investment i s narrowing, and up-to-date figures on municipal spending are now available
on a daily basis. The success o f this program i s being duplicated nationally.

5. Supporting Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Growth. Peru i s r i c h in natural
resources. I t i s the number three producer o f Copper in the World and number six producer o f Gold.
Huge reserves o f natural gas have been found and developed in the Camisea project. Peru also has
large tropical rainforests which are part o f the Amazon. Developing these resources in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner presents great opportunities for the Country as well
as significant challenges.
Mitigating the Social and Eizviroiznzental Impact of Mining. The Mining industry i s a major
contributor to the creation o f national income and fiscal revenues in Peru. As a key driver o f growth,
i t i s important that IFC plays a proactive role in the industry as mandated by the WBG Management
Response to the Extractive Industries Review. IFC i s already making a difference in this area and
will be working with the IBRD to further extend our impact. In addition to the work the L A C
Technical Assistance Facility i s doing in regards to the Canon Minera, I F C i s actively providing S M E
linkages, technical assistance, access to finance and community development in areas surrounding i t s
Extractive Industry (EI) clients. In November 2006, I F C organized an Extractive Industries Forum in
Lima. In IFC’s largest E1 investment in Peru, Yanacocha, IFC i s participating in a community
foundation “Association Los Andes D e Cajamarca” (ALAC) which was founded by Yanacocha’s
shareholders and i s now being extended to include community members and other large corporates in
the area. This association i s providing assistance to SMEs in the Cajamarca region to increase
employment and diversify the local economy from i t s singular reliance on mining.
Augmenting Direct Social Impact of Natural Gas Development. IFC i s pursuing gas projects that
operate in an environmentally and socially responsible way, but that also create regional markets for
natural gas, or that through the domestic production o f liquid hydrocarbons reduce the need for
expensive imports o f more polluting diesel and fuel oil. Projects with a significant footprint will be
prioritized with particular emphasis on the provision o f local project benefits to affected communities.
In addition, IFC i s targeting assistance to junior players in the Peruvian exploration & production
sector with (i)
long-term financing, which i s not available otherwise from the market, and (ii)know
how and value-added services to help client companies setting up adequate environmental and social
management systems. IFC’s current pipeline includes a USS.50 million loan and equity package to
B P Z who i s developing a gas-to-power project.
In the mid-streaddown-stream sectors, IFC i s supporting a $30 million energy efficiency loan to
BBVA to support lending for the conversion to energy efficiency products (mostly conversion to gasfired electricity generation or boilers) and for sustainable forestry management. Going forward, I F C
will continue to support projects that monetize and create markets for stranded natural gas. Projects
that encourage the use o f clean natural gas for car engine combustion, gas-fired electricity generation
or as feedstock for petrochemical production will also be favored.

IFC’s cumulative investment in the country i s U S $ 942 million (US$643 for its o w n account) in 68
projects over 46 years. Committed portfolio as o f September 30, 2006 i s $245 m i l l i o n (US$231 for
i t s o w n account) in 22 companies. The current high probability pipeline for Peru i s USSl92 million.
The Technical Assistance Group has 2 primary projects in the area o f (i)Municipal Simplification
and (ii)
Enhancing local benefits in regions impacted by extractive industries. Additional programs
are under development in access to finance and supply chain integration.

63

Over past 5 year period, IFC made average investment o f $60 million per year. During this period
IFC has invested in building a physical presence in Peru including investment and technical
assistance staff. With this added capacity, IFC projects that during the period o f the current CAS i t s
investment w i l l increase by more than 67% to over $100 mm per year. In addition, IFC will leverage
the synergy with the L A C Technical Assistance Facility and with the IBRD to increase not just its
investment volume, but have a more systemic development impact through knowledge transfer and
greater convening power.

CAS COMPLETION REPORT
I.
Introduction
This completion report evaluates the results obtained during the implementation o f the Peru FY02FY06 CAS. The report draws lessons to inform the preparation o f the FY07-FO11 CAS.

11. Government’s Strategic Goals
The strategic goals o f the Toledo administration were grounded on the National Agreement
(“Acuerdo Nacional), signed on July 22, 2002, which included 31 agreed policies organized into four
broad areas: democracy and rule o f law; competitiveness o f the country; equity and social justice; and
an efficient, transparent and decentralized state. The strategies had wide ownership among the
population. The National Agreement built on a national dialogue initiated by the transition
government that followed the Fujimori’s administration in 2000. The transitional government in 200 1
with the assistance o f the Catholic Church, NGOs, and local governments set citizen roundtables at
national, departmental and municipal levels to foster dialogue among stakeholders on development
priorities and policies, increase accountability and transparency o f public expenditures, and enhance
regional, strategic planning.
T o attack poverty the government strategy set as priorities: competitiveness and employment
generation, access to health, education, culture and basic services; and creating a public
administration that serves the people. As key to achieve these goals, the government put into place an
economic program and institutions ready to buffer the impact o f shocks--and thus ensure that poverty
reduction gains are not lost--while addressing structural sources o f poverty. Given the high debt o f the
country, the government set as priority increasing fiscal revenue and exports, eliminating obstacles to
private sector development, and strengthening governance and institutions.

The country advanced successfully towards i t s long-term development objectives in a wide range o f
fronts6:

The economy grew at over 5% p.a. during the CAS period, driven partly by increases in the
price o f mineral products and partly by dynamic non-traditional exports, which expanded by
108% between 2001 and 2005.
Increased mobilization o f internal resources and a tight fiscal management reduced the
burden o f the debt and increased the long-term currency rating o f i t s debt, which now stands
at BBiPositivelB according to Standard and Poor.
Absolute poverty has fallen from 24.2 % in 2002 to 19.2 in 2004. O n the other hand, total
poverty has fallen from 53.8 in 2002 to 5 1.6 in 2004.

The second column o f Table 1 in the Appendix provides more detailed information on the advances the
country made during the CAS period.

Health indicators have improved overall between 2000 and 2004: the number o f death before
12 months dropped from 33 to 22 percent, and the percentage o f deliveries attended by a
skilled professional rose from 58 percent to 68.4 percent.
Despite these improvements, the broad governance indicators, such as Transparency
Indicators, and the Cost o f Doing Business Data Base have not improved significantly during
the CAS period.

111. Bank Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes
The CAS was targeted towards supporting three key strategic objectives: (i)competitiveness; (ii)
equity and social jdstice; and (iii)
institutionality and g~vernance.~
Measures to directly address the
overarching objective o f poverty reduction were included mainly in the first two areas,
competitiveness and equity and social justice.
T o implement the CAS, the Bank Group supported policy and institutional reforms through a
combination o f AAA and technical assistance loans (TALs), with programmatic loans in support o f
priority areas o f the reform program, including public sector management and decentralization;
addressing barriers to growth and competitiveness; and continued work o n the reform of social
sectors. The CAS sought to support investment operations that would have an impact on the
productive lives o f the poor, through a combination o f rural and urban development programs and
financing to support the institution o f reforms in the social sectors. A renewed focus on
environmental issues especially as linked to health, sustainable use o f natural resources, and
management o f biodiversity; and continued emphasis on partnerships with civil society, and to
addressing inclusion within Bank operations o f specific groups such as youth, women, indigenous
peoples, and Afro- Peruvians.
The CAS was prepared at a time o f some uncertainty about direction o f economic policy o f the new
government and after a lull in Bank engagement. Therefore, the CAS design began w i t h a cautious
note, starting at a base case, with triggers set for both a high and a l o w case (revenue mobilization,
debt management and competitiveness and decentralization.)

By the time o f the CAS progress report (CPR) FY05, the country had met the triggers for the high
case. Since then, the scale o f Bank involvement increased, in terms o f lending and scope and depth o f
engagement. However, the CPR did not alter substantially the drift o f the Bank assistance. The bet
the CAS took on the country paid-off. The Bank became an important player and source o f innovative
ideas.
IV. Results Assessment
Table 1 included in the Appendix presents a summary o f the key results obtained during this CAS
period, and it includes a summary o f the Bank’s contribution and lessons learned.

7

The objectives o f the CAS were aligned with the program o f the Government. Simply, the CAS addressed
together the first and fourth areas o f the government program due to the high degree o f overlap.

66

A. Competitiveness and Trade
The Bank supported the development o f the competitiveness agenda with analytical work undertaken
before and during the CAS. Additionally, the Bank supported implementation o f the emerging
competitiveness agenda through the D P L adjustment series, and various self-standing operations. The
end result has been a wide range o f initiatives, with emphasis o n the building o f key institutions and
basic legal framework, articulating sector and regional strategies, and commencing implementation.
The country has succeeded in setting basic institutions to support competitiveness. The initial
efforts were directed to put in place the basic institutions for competitiveness. The D P L has helped
monitor the development o f the broad institutional framework, which includes the creation National
Competitiveness Council and the National Competitiveness Plan (NCP-2005.) Additionally, the Bank
has supported efforts to increase the competitiveness o f the regions, beginning w i t h the development
o f regional competitiveness indicators. Going forward’ much will depend o f the leadership and
effectiveness o f the CNC as a publiciprivate agency, which takes on the coordinating role in the
implementation o f the NCP. This w i l l be a challenge given the wide scope o f the participating
agencies and detailed agendas. Some prioritization o f the competitiveness agenda would help
implement at ion.
The Bank assistance supported the national effort to increased access of domestic production
foreign markets. During this CAS period Peru has further opened its economy to trade and has
moved aggressively towards negotiating and signing bilateral and multilateral agreements, with an
emphasis upon concluding the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the U . S . Peru has also progressed
w i t h the negotiation o f bilateral trade agreements w i t h MERCOSUR, Mexico, Chile, Singapore,
Thailand, and the E.U. through the Andean Community. I t also undertook an initial restructuring of
the trade supporting institutions and developed national, regional and sector export plans, with special
attention to tourism.

The Bank has supported several aspects o f these initiatives. A project8 focuses o n breaking the
barriers that limit small and medium enterprises (SME) from entering markets abroad, w i t h focus on:
foreign trade finance; access to technology; compliance with norms; and supporting creation o f
associations (consorcios). The project i s s t i l l under implementation and full results are yet to
materialize. The D P L series has also supported measures to breaking barriers to accessing external
markets and increase the capacity o f the regions to compete. The trade focus o f the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) should help the government address the challenges o f adjusting the
economy to the FTA.
There are signs that the strategy to rely on new enterprises and products to drive the diversification o f
the economy i s on the right track. N o t only are non-traditional exports growing very fast, but 500 new
products are now being exported and around 1500 companies that service international markets have
been created.
The Bank Group supported initial government’s efforts to improve the business environment. Both
the IFC and the Bank have supported improvements in the business environment and reduction o f red
tape. Following a bottoms-up approach, the IFC has worked w i t h the municipality o f L i m a and helped
reduce the number o f days needed for registration from 62 to 2; the number o f companies registering
increased by 700% up to July 2006 with respect to 2005, as they moved from informality to
formality. Given that the regulatory costs at the municipal level dominate the national index, these
achievements are expected to improve Peru’s ranking in the Cost o f Doing Business Data Base,

* Export Competitiveness a n d Trade Facilitation TAL and Investment Loan.
67

where Peru ranked 71 out o f 150 in 2005. The Bank has supported the creation of a nationwide
electronic platform to facilitate registration on-line; but this top-down approach has proceeded slowly.
A convergence o f bottoms-up and top-down approaches could serve to institutionalize a national
system that facilitates registration and reduces the burden o f licensing and inspections; but this will
take time, and i t i s best built gradually than mandate by law. There has been increasing awareness
amongst the government agencies, the private sector and the donor community o f the need to j o i n
efforts in improving the business environment in the area o f registration. Strong leadership w i l l be
needed to implement this agenda.
T h e Bank has also been supporting efforts by the government to reduce the cost of logistic and
Improve Public Services in Infrastructure. The cost o f logistics (around 32% o f GDP) in Peru i s
amongst the highest in Latin America’ and an emerging deficit in infrastructure hinders
competitiveness. A growing economy and the very l o w levels o f public investment--around 1 percent
o f GDP-are creating this deficit. The Government has made important advances in implementing an
infrastructure modernization program based o n a two-fold strategy consisting o f increasing private
sector participation (PSP), and at the same time, improving the institutions and regulations that
govern the management o f public infrastructure assets at both the national and regional levels. The
government, for instance, towards the end o f the C A S has sought a greater involvement o f the private
a first package o f
sector in the management and expansion o f transport infrastructure-including,
regional airports, several roads, and a terminal at the Port o f Callao, which should help lower logistics
costs significantly.

T o support these efforts, the Bank has provided a partial guarantee scheme to facilitate private
involvement in infrastructure, within a framework for the environmental and social management o f
infrastructure projects. The $200 million operation can help mobilize up to 1 b i l l i o n dollars in private
investment into infrastructure. The D P L has supported the development o f comprehensive transport
strategies, and the Trade Facilitation TAL and other donor-funded programs initiated the preparation
o f institutional strengthening and investment plans in various transport sub-sectors. Other Bank
projects, approved during the CAS period, also have targeted improvements in transportation,
although most o f them are at the beginning o f implementation and hence have yet to produce definite
results. Reduction in the transport time along the main arteries in Lima, facilitating the access to the
port o f Callao, will definitely hrther reduce logistics costs. The Regional Transportation Project w i l l
assist in the decentralization o f transportation policy at the regional level, building o n the very
successful experience o f the 2’ld Rural Roads project.
Improve the M i x and Quality of Peruvian Products and Increase Productivity. The Bank has
supported the Government’s program for the promotion o f production and productivity focused o n
four key areas identified by prior studies as key obstacles to productivity and economic activity:
quality management, technology abruption and innovation, productive chain integration and labor
force development. The strengthening and expansion o f CITES (especially to the regions) are a key
element o f this strategy. I O The technical assistance has also included the issuance o f technical norms,
the accreditation o f entities to carry out conformity assessment, and the approval quality laboratories.
During the C A S period, the government implemented the recommendations o f the 2001 FSAP, undertaken
jointly with the IMF. The 2005 FSAP Update, noted significant improvements in the health o f the financial
sector, which, however, still remains small by comparison to other Latin American countries. Notably, because
o f the early privatization o f the telecommunications sector, Peru n o w posts one the most advanced I C T sectors
in Latin America.

Several projects supporting agriculture matured during this CAS period with positive results
overall. Projects in irrigation, rural roads and research and technology were completed during the
CAS period and were rated satisfactorily. The evaluations included samples taken from the
beneficiary population and the results show high rates o f return. The Agricultural Research Project
has shown that i t i s possible to involve the private sector successfully through a program o f research
grants. The irrigation project helped organized water management associations, with some o f them
already fully economically sustainable." The project has also helped remove uncertainty o n water
rights. The Rural Roads project implemented a strategy to rehabilitate roads prioritized by local
stakeholders through participatory planning and maintain them w i t h community participation.12 The
Bank has continued to work in a l l o f these areas through new projects or extensions.

The Bank has helped develop an improved understanding of the considerable environmental
challenges in Peru. The Bank has contributed w i t h solid analytical work, which points to
environmental risks Peru faces in several fronts, including the impact o f mining activities; the
emerging water deficit; etc. As two projects, the GEF PE Participatory Management o f Protected
Areas i s under implementation and has yet to post significant results.

B. Equitable Developmen2
The National Accord complemented attention to fiscal restrain and competitiveness w i t h emphasis o n
social development and inclusiveness. The Bank support in this area came through a series o f
adjustment operations, technical assistance, investment operations, and analytical work. Also the
work o n the social sectors has been highly interlinked w i t h the decentralization effort. A difficult
political economy rested impetus from the government initial commitment and likewise weakened the
effectiveness o f the donor support. Thus the achievements, especially through adjustment, were
important but o f limited impact. As intended in the CAS, several investment operations were directed
to benefit the poor; however, the impact o f these operations on poverty reductions cannot be
ascertained.

The second roads project, now close to completion, i s exceeding the original Development objectives,
regarding road rehabilitation and maintenance o f community tracks for motorized transport. This work has
been mostly with micro-enterprises formed and trained under the project. Also, it has also contributed to the
national decentralization.

So far the Bank has provided assistance in agriculture through self-standing operations, w i t h limited
coordination in the design. Still, the question arises as to their combined impact and their possible contribution
to the current growth drive, especially in the coastal areas.

Budgetary allocations to the social sectors. The overall budgetary allocations to the social sectors
have increased as intended by the National Agreement and supported by the Bank; however, these
increases have been driven mostly by higher salaries; non-salary allocations have remained constant
around 1 percent o f GDP. Additionally, given that the increase in revenues i s associated with
increases in the prices o f minerals i s being channeled through the canon for investment to the
municipalities, there i s the perception that the social sectors have not shared in the new prosperity.
The Bankprogram has had apositive impact on the health sector. The PRSL series supported w i t h

success the targeting o f a basic health insurance for the poor (SIS) towards rural areas. l 5 The PSRL
also supported, with success, the delivery o f basic health service relying on local community
organizations. l6 An investment project on rural health has successfully helped improve health
indicators in the selected areas, which are amongst the poorest in the country.I7 The success o f the
project came after it was restructured following an improved understanding o f the casual chain o f
factors affecting child and maternal mortality. The project has also helped improve the information
system on health outcomes in the eight regions covered by the project. A follow-up project i s under
preparation. Despite these advances the health system remains highly fragmented, lacking central
coordinating mechanisms for the purchase o f medical services in order to drive costs down. Political
economy factors seem to be at play.
Bank support in the area of education has not been as effective as had been expected under CAS.
In education, poor progress was made with the support o f Bank, including the tracking and

management o f teachers, and approval o f general laws on education and teachers. Teachers' salaries
have also been increased. But effective reforms on the critical areas o f the sector remained untouched.
Repeated changes in ministries and the power o f vested interests may well have precluded true
progress. Efforts to induce change under the adjustment operation came to naught. The
implementation o f a Rural Education Project has been very difficult. Statistics show that in Peru
education coverage ranks higher than in other Latin American countries with similar income per
capita. The problem i s quality. Progress in education in Peru will require innovative ways the current
l o w level trap.
Viva (CV.
A constitutional amendment was passed to
close the much abused CV and to eliminate the indexing o f benefits to the salaries o f active workers,
contribution rates were increased, an effective internal tax on the highest pensions was introduced,
and rules were tightened for determining, adjusting and capping benefits. For the f i r s t time, the
Government prepared a strategy and action plan for the long-term reform o f the pension system

During 2004, the SIS continued to expand, covering at year end 9.1 million affiliates, including almost 3.1
m i l l i o n infants below age 5 and 656 thousand pregnant women and nursing mothers. Some 84 percent o f
affiliates and 78 percent o f patients attended lived in rural or marginal urban zones, and more than 60 percent o f
affiliates and 54 percent o f patients attended were in the first two per capita income quintiles.
16

After several years o f rapid expansion, the growth o f locally co-managed primary health centers (CLAS) has
leveled o f f and account for roughly 35 percent ofprimary health establishments, serving more than 8 m i l l i o n
clients, mostly in poor, rural areas. The future o f this widely heralded innovation in primary health care delivery
is n o w in doubt because o f continuing resistance among physicians and the formalization o f the positions o f
doctors working in them, with the result o f reducing their operational flexibility.
17

F o r instance, in the intended areas, the number o f deaths before 12 months per 1,000 births decreases from 33
percent in 2000 to 23 percent in 2004. Given that these areas are amongst the poorer in the country, the child
mortality indicator i s n o w closer to the national average.
The 2001 FSAP had recommended the reform o f the public pension system. The pension system outside the
public sector is private.

and performance o f the private pension system.
Monitoring poverty and the tracking the impact of Bank interventions on poverty. The Bank
concluded a Poverty Evaluation analysis in FY06. The fact hat poverty reduction has not fallen w i t h
the fast economic growth, as i s the international experience, i s receiving closer attention from the

Bank and the government. Early indications suggest that the impact o f growth on poverty reduction
may have been underestimated. Regardless, the debate highlights the need to improve the tracking
impact on key development objectives, such as poverty reduction.
Improved targeting has become an important, institutionalized tool o f anti-poverty policy. In Peru
although agreed improvements in targeting to low-income districts were achieved under PSRL, much
remains to be done. A recent MEF study indicates that the higher-income regions o f the country
continue to receive larger per capita public health subsidies, including under the SIS, than do the
poorer regions. The Bank also sought through the adjustment operations to better integrate poverty
indicators into the r u l e s determining transfers from the central government to regions and
municipalities and therefore correct the emerging imbalances in the distribution o f the resources.
As noted by the CAS, the several projects under execution at the time were targeted o n poverty
reduction and moreover one o f the principles o f the CAS was to focus investment operations to have
an impact on the poor, especially in rural areas. I t was indeed the case that some o f the new projects
approved targeted the poor (especially, with i t s focus on rural areas’’); however, the impact o f these
projects on the poor has not been evaluated. An impact evaluation would help clarify if the approach
o f the CAS (imbedded in some o f the projects) indeed i s having a substantive impact on poverty.
Bank assistance has helped improve the property rights of the poor in urban areas. (ICR) Perhaps
the most successful project in the Bank’s portfolio has been the support to titling lands in urban areas
where the poor live. The project helped issued 1135000 property titles, with an impact o n around 5
million poor people. The certainty o f the property titles induced an increase in credit given to the

*’

owners. The appropriable high levels o f benefits contributed to the success o f the project. A follow-up
project i s under preparation.

Progress in Water and sanitation. The Bank assisted successfully with the rehabilitation o f the

National Lima Water Company (SEDAPAL) with a project that was completed during this CAS
period. The project objective o f improving water availability via improved management o n both the
demand and supply sides was amply met. Service continuity increased from 11.5 hours per day in
1995 to 20.4 hours per day in 2002 while total volume o f water billed in 2002 was lower than at the
outset o f the project in 1994 and water coverage increased from 75 % to 88 %. Financial
sustainability o f SEDAPAL improved substantially over the l i f e o f the project allowing to triple the
annual level o f investments from 1995 to 2002, and to finance on average 50% o f these investments
from internally generated cash flow. There was also progress in efficiency with labor productivity
improving from 2.5 employees per thousand connections in 1994 to 1.8 employees per thousand
connections in 2000. In 2003 the Board approved U S $ 20 million o f additional financing in order to
build the secondary distribution networks needed to connect about 130,000 poor people, with a
different design and approach based upon the use o f condominia1 systems. The strategy has been
successful on a pilot level and i s now being implemented at full scale although with some delays due
to a reduction o f budget ceilings that required contract amendments. Also, the implementation o f an
innovative design under the Rural Water and Sanitation Project has likewise been delayed. This time,

because o f a complex implementation arrangement where the project was executed by FONCODES -which lost i t s administrative independence and was transferred to the Ministry o f Women and Social
Development soon after the project became effective--, under the responsibility o f the Vice-ministry
o f Construction and Sanitation (Ministry o f Housing). The change o f status o f FONCODES
negatively affected project implementation and diluted responsibilities for project implementation
between the two ministries involved and FONCODES. The Government and the Bank have recently
amended the Loan Agreement to change the institutional arrangements given full responsibility for
implementation o f the Vice-ministry o f Construction and Sanitation. As a consequence o f all o f this,
the expected increases in the coverage o f water and sanitation services did not materialized.
Towards the end of the CAS period the Bank and Government produced important analytical work
on the social situation of the country. Published under the t i t l e “Recurso”, the studies included take
stock o f the long-term developments o f social outcomes, and identify the constraints to improving
them. “Recurso ” also proposes an agenda forward, suggesting the need for a new social contract and

calling for alternative approach to reforms, based fundamentally on a clear spelling o f measurable
objectives and the involvement o f all stakeholders. As some have pointed out, effectiveness i s also
likely to require attention to the reforms needed in the service delivery mechanisms.

C. Institutionality and Governance
The incoming administration inherited a difficult governance situation, the result o f scandals and
corruption. The National Accord called for improved governance and a determined fight against
corruption. The agenda that emerged gravitated towards tight fiscal policy, decentralization and
transparency, with emphasis on community involvement. Progress injustice reform and inclusion was
less notable. Despite the achievements obtained, Peru’s governance rankings have hardly improved,
suggesting that the gains have yet to be consolidated to have an impact.
Decentralization has been a driving overarching motive affecting most components o f the program.
The political forces behind the process are strong, and ownership i s high. With hindsight, the
decentralization agenda advanced faster than originally expected, pressuring decision makers and
advisors and possibly diverting attention from other priorities. The Bank supported and defended
assiduously a decentralization process which would be fiscally neutral, gradual and complementary
with the competitiveness agenda. Both the PSRL and the D E C S A L series focus on the
decentralization process.2’ This approach was both correct and successful, but the process o f
decentralization i s still at midstream, with a political apparatus in place in the regions, and the bulk of
responsibilities yet to be transferred.
The Bank supported the Government’s successful drive to consolidate a solid macroeconomic
management. The Bank, jointly with the IMF, supported the government in its efforts to improve the

macroeconomic situation and the quality o f the macroeconomic management. The high commitment
o f government and especially the Ministry o f Finance and Economy (MEF) made the support o f the
Bank and other donors highly effective, with concrete results on the ground. A Fiscal Responsibility
L a w (not always adhere to) provided a basic framework for fiscal policy. Notably, high economic
growth and a tight fiscal deficit reduced the public sector debt and contributed to continuous increases
in the grading o f its international financial obligations. Technical assistance has helped improve the
debt profile o f the country and create as well one o f the most technically capable debt management
debt units at the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. The level o f tax mobilization increased helped
the country reach the CAS high case. Although, the increase in the prices o f basic mineral

commodities contributed substantially to the increase in tax collection, policy changes that broadened
or raised the tax base helped as
Moving forward and given the risks o f drops in the price of
minerals, i t i s prudent to maintain the efforts to improve both tax policy and tax administration.
The Bank assisted the Government in setting the basis for the decentralization process. During the
CAS period, the country advanced in setting an institutional framework for d e ~ e n t r a l i z a t i o nand
~ ~ has
been taking significant steps on the ground including both the political and the economic fronts. The
support for this process in the Bank has been in the form o f analytical work and technical assistance
as well as in advising caution to prevent the fiscal pangs that have consumed other Latin-American
countries.

Many significant reforms in decentralization have been made with the support o f the D C D P L and the
PSRL series. Regional governments, formerly appointed by the central government, are now led by
elected officials. Fiscal consolidation has been supported by an expansion o f revenues through tax
policy and administration reform, especially at the regional and local levels, and by a system o f tax
sharing that reflects economic activity and poverty incidence. The system o f intergovernmental
transfers has been fiscally neutral, ensuring adequate financing and tax effort incentives at each level
o f government. The framework policy for decentralization, including fiscal decentralization (covering
revenues, assets, personnel, fiscal transfers, revenue sharing, and accreditation process o f sub-national
governments) i s in place. This framework ensures transparency and fiscal responsibility for both
national and sub-national governments, including debt policy for sub-nationals. As well, systems for
budget preparation and execution and investment planning are being implemented in local
governments throughout the country.

While adjustment operations have been seen assisting the Government o f Peru in putting in place a
sound institutional and fiscal framework for decentralization, several investment loans have played a
key role in supporting the decentralization process in specific sectors. In particular, in the transport
sector, the design o f specific lanning instruments and institutional arrangements (Provincial Road
Institutes), supported by the 2 n rRural Roads project, contributed to the successful experience.
The progress made in improving the management of public resources nationwide has been
significant. The CAS called on the implementation o f the action plans o f the fiduciary assessment
(CFFA) and a procurement assessment (CPAR) completed in 2001. I t emphasized the importance o f
improving the management o f public resources as part o f the strategy to increase transparency and
efficiency and reduce corruption. Some results have been achieved in meeting this agenda: the system
o f public expenditure management (SIAF) has been improved an extended to all ministries providing
opportune information on budget execution, which i s being increasingly made available to the public
through electronic means. 24 Also, the compliance with budgetary procedures has improved. Yet, the
S I A F remains a partially completed system.25
22 Tax revenues collected by local governments, on the other hand, have remained low, representing only 0.3
percent o f GDP in the last years, but with a moderate upward trend in recent years. Some municipalities have
taken advantage o f their control over some aspects o f revenue administration and created semi-autonomous
agencies for the administration o f revenue collection

Mention here key laws that have been approved.
The S I N financial control system has n o w incorporated some 800 municipalities, o r about 40 percent o f the
total. Most ministries and many sub-national governments are providing financial and other information on
public websites. This information, along with S I A F data on budget, expenditures, and transfers for a l l
government programs, are being increasingly used by c i v i l society organizations, including professional
23

A new legal framework was established for transparent and competitive public procurement, and
steady progress has been made in the introduction, extension, and refinement o f a web-based
procurement system, with particular attention under PSRL to the food distribution programs. The
electronic procurement system has greatly reduced the time and costs involved in completing
transactions as well as the opportunities for abuse. The preliminary results o f a review o f the Public
Expenditure System have identified areas that need strengthening (internal control, external oversight,
etc.) Progress in implementing the emerging agendas during the coming CAS not only will help
improve transparency but facilitate a greater integration o f the Bank’s investment and technical
assistance operations into the country systems.
A
legally mandated system o f accreditation seeks to ensure that transfer responsibilities to the local
governments protect the delivery o f basic services; today, most o f the responsibilities transferred
correspond to those programs that can be easily carved out from the national budget. These included
some key social assistance programs. T o insure against deterioration in service delivery, a system o f
contracts between the central and the local governments has been developing linking devolution o f
services with delivery. This approach i s too recent to be evaluated.

Accreditation, capacity building, transfer of responsibilities and Monitoring and evaluation.

The system of public investment evaluation was solidiped during this CAS period. The government
strengthened the system o f public investment evaluation and selection (SNIP), which i t had inherited.
Strict adherence to determining the eligibility o f the public investment initiatives by the SNIP under
the MEF proved effective but controversial, as the SNIP was seen as constraining investment,
particularly at the regional level. O f lately, the stock o f eligible projects has increased easing partially
these tensions.26Still, some argue for a more decentralized approach to the evaluation and selection o f
projects within budget envelopes. Others point to the need to embed projects selection within wider
strategic vision o f development and point to the limitations o f the MEF to carry out this task. The
presumption being that development vision was lost in the merger that led to the creation o f the MEF.
The Bank continued to support the Justice system to improve services. During the 1990s the
executive branch overtly intervened in the control o f the judicial branch and attempted to advance an
administrative modernization agenda in the courts and such agencies as the judicial council, which i s
in charge o f the selection and promotion o f judges. In the late 1990’s the Bank’s judicial reform
program did not become effective. However, during this CAS period and with the democratic
transition, the government, both the executive and judicial branches, requested the Bank’s support to

organizations, universities, and the media. Users tend to be located principally in L i m a and other major
population centers, however, with access more limited in the rural areas.
Despite coverage progress w i t h the budget, treasury and accounting modules, full integration o f financial
management remains to be achieved at both central and local levels. The system as i t i s currently neither
integrates nor reconciles the budget classification w i t h the country’s accounting codes, which makes i t difficult
to monitor budget rules that have to do primarily with budgeting. At the local level, integration i s also limited
and on-line registration and reporting i s still restricted to larger municipalities. Secondly, SIAF cannot count on
a single Treasury account and therefore cannot adequately contribute to efficient cash management or control o f
balances. Multiple Treasury accounts not only hinder the timely and accurate f l o w o f financial information but
weaken transparency, creating opportunities for corruption. In addition, SIAF-GL has not yet developed the
debt module for municipalities.

The number o f investment projects approved by the SNIP increased from 510 in 2002 to 8288 in 2005.

retake the task o f modernizing the justice system2’ and has been made progress most notably o n
commercial issues with the established o f specialized courts in the Judicial district o f Lima, which
accounts for more than a half o f the country’s caseload in this area. The Bank, for i t s part, has begun
to implement a technical assistance project with four key sector agencies including the Judiciary,
Ministry o f Justice, judicial Council and Judicial Academy. The project i s focused on finding
sustainable ways to address: (a) access to justice services; (b) strengthening institutional capacity; and
(c) enhancing the celerity o f procedures. The project, however, i s at the beginning o f implementation,
with results expected under the next CPS.
Support for increased community participation was an integral part of the work on governance and
decentralization. The involvement o f the community has been an integral part o f the governance

strategy. The program emphasized making the information available and participation. 28 The
Transparency and Access to Information L a w and i t s regulations have established extensive citizen
rights to information and mechanisms for holding public officials accountable. Compliance with the
Transparency L a w and timely information dissemination regarding the use and results o f transfers
received from the central government are legally mandated prerequisites for accrediting sub-national
governments to be granted decentralized authority over social programs.
Additionally, consultative mechanisms continue to h n c t i o n and are active nationwide in a formal
process o f local participatory budgeting-perhaps the most extensive mechanism o f its kind in the
world--mandated by law and made a precondition for the decentralization o f social programs to local
governments. Also, communities are exercising greater oversight over the outcomes o f public
expenditure. Still, these mechanisms remain limited to monitoring and evaluation.
Social iizclusion remains a significant challenge in Peru. Despite the prominent place the National

Accord gave to social inclusion and the help from the Bank and the donor community, limited
progress was made in increasing the social inclusion o f the poor and marginal. Many o f the
participatory mechanisms and institutions that have been put in place have benefited mostly the
already included-urban,
educated, medium income, etc. Bank efforts to involve marginal
populations in the management o f natural resources did not fare well.29 These results suggest that
complementary approaches to involve the excluded need to be developed. At issue i s how well
participating civil society organizations represent their claimed constituencies. Also, the participatory
mechanisms that have been created are intended to be consultative rather than decision-making and
need to be complemented by actions to enhance the capacities and efficiency o f the institutions o f
representative democracy.

27

The basis for this work has been the Acuerdo Nacional and the reports o f CERIAJUS (the special
Commission for Reform o f the Justice Sector), which brought together the majority o f stakeholders to agree on
a variety o f reform iniciatives.
28
The Bank has played a leading role in advocating greater participation beginning even before the transition
period. The Letter o f Social Policy that kicked o f f the PSRL program was prepared by the Transition
Government based on an extensive social dialogue, conducted in large part through more than 450 roundtables
(Mesas de Concertacion) organized at the national, departmental and local levels. The Mesas and other c i v i l
society organizations were also involved under the Toledo Government in the drafting o f departmental
development plans and an Acuerdo Nacional, endorsed by the major political parties and setting out the priority
objectives o f the social agenda.
For instance, the LIL on Indigenous and A f r o Peruvian people’s development project could not be completed
and i t s performance was rated as unsatisfactory. O f the lessons learned from this failure stands out the lack o f
legitimacy amongst the intended beneficiaries o f an institution (CONAPA) created ad-hoc to implement this
type o f project.
29

75

Finding entry points to civil service reform. Despite a law approved and in place, progress towards
civil service reform has been limited to some entry points. The Bank supported the creation of a
Unified Payroll System, which now covers 98 percent o f teacher positions. File-by-file crosschecking o f positions against payrolls and the shift to automatic electronic salary payments through
the S I A F system have made possible the elimination o f payments to “phantom” teachers as well as
widespread overpayments for the positions occupied. A greater control o f the wage can be stepping
stone to greater control o f the recurrent expenditures.

V. Bank Performance
After a period o f relative absence, the Bank has become a presence in Peru in terms o f lending,
analytical work, provider o f innovative ideas and most importantly key development partner o f the
country.

Lending
Bank yearly commitments increased from 658 millions in FY03 to 915 millions in FY04, as a result
of the country moving to the high case. As a consequence the number o f projects in the portfolio has
increased from 8 at the beginning o f the CAS period and 15 now. Several o f the new projects or those
under preparation are continuation o f the previous initiatives (rural roads, research and technology in
agriculture, irrigation, Lima water, rural water and sanitation, PSRL, etc.) others have represented
new departures for the Bank (Lima transport, regional roads, infrastructure guarantee, Vilcanota
Valley, D E C S A L etc.)
The adjustment operations were the main drivers o f Bank assistance. The seven adjustment operations
approved during this CAS period disbursed 79.4 percent o f the total disbursements. Besides providing
the bulk o f the resources, the adjustment operations helped monitor important components o f the
reform process as had been originally intended. Both series o f adjustments (PSRL and DECSAL)
provided the government and Bank with a platform to carry out a productive dialogue around key
development issues-decentralization, fiscal management, and social services. The flexible design o f
the adjustment operations permitted the Bank to respond to evolving political developments
effectively, particularly in the area o f decentralization. Still, a good part o f the achievements have
been procedural relating mostly to the setting o f new institutional frameworks. With the institutions in
place a greater focus on results on the ground related to development objectives-for
instance
increased service delivery at the local level rather than maintaining a prudent fiscal stance.
Additionally, the themes covered by the two adjustment series were highly inter-related, but the
evolving dynamics o f the two set o f operations were not always mutually supportive.
The impact o f investment operations has been quite varied. Some o f the older projects have been
concluded successfully, with most o f them graded as sati~factory.~’The performance o f the newer
portfolio i s less satisfactory due mostly to the high lead times in preparation and effectiveness and the
l o w disbursement ratios. The current portfolio i s currently quite young3’ and intensive in institutional
30

See Table 4 in the Appendix. O f eleven (1 1) projects, two were ranked highly satisfactory and one was
ranked unsatisfactory, the rest have been ranked satisfactory.
31
At the beginning o f the CAS there were 8 operations and one GEF under implementation w i t h focus on
poverty: health sector reform, rural roads, L i m a Water Rehabilitation, urban property rights, irrigation
rehabilitation (water associations), sierra natural resources, agricultural research and extension, indigenous
people’s development, and indigenous management o f public resources.

76

innovation, which can delay disbursements, sometimes by design. Possibly also the l o w rate of
disbursements may be a consequence o f the tight fiscal stance o f the state and the l o w level o f public
investment. Also, possibly there has been a learning effect as the responsibility for project
management i s being moved to the sector ministries and away from implementation agencies.
Complexity o f project design has been the culprit in some cases. Lastly, political instability, l o w
ownership and difficult political economy may also have been contributing factors.
The l o w
disbursements have affected the capacity o f the Bank to assist the government in following up the
initiatives launched during the adjustment operations.

The degree o f selectively in Bank engagements has decreased. Today the Bank i s engaged in a wider
range o f areas and products than i t was the case at the beginning o f the CAS. The loss o f selectivity
risks reducing effectiveness, unless the institutional capacity o f the W o r l d Bank to deliver i s
enhanced.
Analytical and Advisory Services (AAA)

The Bank produced a substantial body o f analytical work and provided direct on-time technical
assistance to the government, in areas like decentralization, etc. Table 3 o f the Appendix compares
the original AAA program with i t s execution. The analytical work has been an important input in
developing the agenda o f the adjustment and investment operations. The CAS left a wealth o f
analytical work, which includes: RECURSO on social issues, a Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM) with emphasis on trade, review o f the status o f the environment, a rural infrastructure strategy,
updates o f the fiduciary work, evaluation o f the role o f concessions, and a poverty analysis. Lastly,
the Bank team has put together a set o f 33 thematic notes, which have been presented as a
contribution to the incoming a d m i n i ~ t r a t i o n . ~ ~

The Bank has increasingly assigned importance to the dissemination o f the analytical work as a
contribution towards a broad nationwide discussion o f development issues. This has been especially

the case o f RECURSO, whose ample dissemination it i s hoped w i l l help the population develop a
better understanding o f the current situation in the social sectors, exemplary developments, and the
situation in other countries. The lesson from RECURSO i s dissemination requires a transformation o f
the information (through visual means, etc.) to make i t accessible to the public.
Bank Portfolio Performance and Management
Peru i s an IBRD country (US$2,360 per capita income). The ongoing investment portfolio consists
o f 15 operations for a net commitment o f US$548 million, o f which US$371 million remain
undisbursed. Bank support has focused on consolidating reforms in public administration and
decentralization, competitiveness and growth, and equity and social services, particularly in rural
areas. Overall, Peru has a disbursement ratio o f 12.2%. As o f end-June 2006, IFC’s outstanding
portfolio stood at $198 million. In terms o f sectors, one third o f the portfolio was in food and
beverage (36.4%) mostly in export-oriented companies, followed by transportation (16.3%), tourism
(1 1.3%), agribusiness (10.3%), utilities (8.9%), and the financial sector (5.4%).
There are general factors affecting the country’s portfolio performance, and that are related to various
aspects including readiness for implementation, counterpart funds availability, and the high staff
turnover.

N o comprehensive QAG has been undertaken to evaluate the quality o f the analytical work.

77

The country has full ownership o f it development programs, which are fully funded and included in
the budget. However, at times some ongoing investment projects have been delayed due to temporary
shortages and unavailability o f counterpart funds. Application o f the new Bank policy on eligible
expenditure w i l l facilitate the implementation o f Bank projects. I t w i l l allow the Bank and the
Government to determine the cost-sharing ratio for projects that best supports implementation while
also retaining country ownership, sustainability o f project achievements, and leveraging o f Bank
funds. Changes are also expected to facilitate the administration o f projects by reducing the need for
the traditional pari-passu approach, because cost-sharing w i l l not have to be at the level o f individual
expenditures. Project managers w i l l be able to focus more o n the technical aspects o f project
implementation, rather than on financing categories. Thus, from both an aggregate fiscal point o f
view, and from the project implementation perspective, the Bank’s greater flexibility in financing
project costs w i l l help to meet their development objectives.
Special attention i s the fast-track project preparation cycle usually performed with n o clear
government ownership and minimum institutional arrangements in place. There i s a tendency to
postpone the implementation o f effective financial management arrangements, which means
postponing the problems to implementation stages. Additionally, there i s lack o f synchronization
between Bank’s preparation cycle and Government’s internal processing cycle.
The use o f counterpart funds suffers from lack o f fiscal space with an impact on availability o f
counterpart funds and implementation progress. In case o f cash shortages in the Designated Bank
Account (previously Special Account), projects do not make payments at 100% and get reimbursed
by the Bank (Even though counterparts are available).
There i s high staff turnover that causes loss o f institutional memory and capacity with an impact on
implementation progress and reduces level o f disbursements. The causes in some cases are related to
political changes andor interference.
Working With the Donor Community

The Bank has collaborated tightly with the IMF, including in the development and the
implementation o f the successful Stand-By operation.
The Bank has established closed linkages with the donor community in Peru, including bilateral and
multilateral organizations. The most active partnerships have been established around certain policies
such as decentralization (with Germany’s KFW), education (together with IADB’s joint program on
rural education), transport (with the shared Lima Transport Project with IADB), roads (with IADB)
and health (in closed coordination with the Health program o f IADB), public expenditure
management (Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) with IADB). In addition, the Bank has
played a key role as a lead member o f the donor community throughout all the thematic groups
organized amongst donors. These include coordination groups for decentralization, justice
modernization, education, and rural development. An important task performed by the bank was the
development o f a database tracking system to gather information throughout all the donor community
and share common information on our programs in the country.

VI. Conclusions and Recommendations going forward.
The implementation o f the CAS began during a period o f transition and after the Bank had reduced i t s
involvement in the country. The CAS strategy was aligned with the National Accord, which had
broad national support. With hindsight, the focus on competitiveness, decentralization and social

78

sectors, seems adequate, although some think that a greater emphasis o n anti-corruption would have
benefited the image o f the country.

CAS implementation helped Peru post achievements in a wide range o f areas, but most of these
achievements are first steps that need to be consolidated to be effective. The most salient achievement
has been the solid and improved macroeconomic situation; the Bank’s contribution in this area was
significant, most useful perhaps in helping keep decentralization under the rule o f fiscal neutrality.
B u t the growth and fiscal prospects continue to be frail to possible downturns in the prices of
minerals, and the internal expenditure pressures surrounding decentralization.
The rest o f the program was relatively flexible and opportunistic focused more o n the creation of
institutional building blocks rather than permanent and sustainable results. The results were varied.
by dynamism of the
The progress in diversifying the economy has been significant-measured
entrants (products and firms) into the export markets. But greater consolidation i s needed here for the
country to be prepared to deal with drops in the prices o f raw materials, should they take place. A

greater determination o f the government and private sector at the national and regional will be needed
to advance an effective competitiveness agenda.

The progress regarding social sector reform fell short o f expectations. The achievements, while
significant, were isolated points o f entry that did not materialize into comprehensive reforms. These
developments contributed to a slow down o f the decentralization process, where progress requires a
clear allocation o f responsibilities by level o f government, and therefore progress in the reform o f the
social sectors. As i t stands now, the decentralization process i s mid-way w i t h political and
administrative machinery in place and the active transfer o f resources and responsibilities mid-way.
The risk i s that fiscal prudence w i l l give away as the pressures for effective decentralization mount. A
complementary agenda o f effective transfer o f responsibilities has to complement the concern w i t h
fiscal neutrality.
Some progress was made in management o f public resources, including at the local level,
implementing recommendations from analytical work completed previous to the CAS. Some
incursions (entry points) were made to commence the reform o f the c i v i l service. However, much
greater efforts w i l l be needed to up-grade the overall effectiveness o f the c i v i l service and reduce its
share o f budget costs, to thus help open fiscal space needed for public investment. The achievements
o n macro-economic management, competitiveness and decentralization are not reflected in the
international rankings o f the country. The perception inherited about corruption and poor governance
still holds. Lastly, the inclusion o f the most vulnerable remains a dream.

Lessons and Recommendations
The country has benefited front a wise management of the contnzodity boom, but continued
prudence is izeeded to consolidate achievements and further reduce the risks of potential shocks to
the economy. Enhancing competitiveness and economic diversification, completing decentralization,
increasing the credibility o f the state and delivering quality social services to a l l (especially the poor)
remain a valid agenda; but, a forceful political commitment i s needed to move beyond setting the
basic institutional framework, which has been mostly the case thus far and delivering results.
The low elasticity of poverty reduction to economic growth merits attention, including examining:
(a) the accuracy o f the statistical instruments; and (b) the effectiveness o f the linkages o f the
economic sectors where the poor are located (agriculture. services, etc.); and (c) social programs in
place to reach the poor. This would also include a better understanding o f the impact of the Bank

79

projects o n poverty reduction. Today, it i s often stated that Bank projects are oriented to the poor, but
the impact i s neither measured nor accessed.
For instance, the current advice on transparency and participation has not allowed reaching the
most vulnerable groups of the population and increasing inclusion significant&. The capacity of
the c i v i l society organizations to represent the poor i s at issue. A rethinking o f the basic instruments
that are being recommended to access the poor and vulnerable i s probably needed; including the
design and implementation o f alternative intervention instruments.
The CAS focus on introducing innovations has been effective and exploited the Bank’s
comparative advantage in knowledge and iizizovation. The Bank has contributed w i t h innovative
ideas in a variety o f fronts: infrastructure guarantee, urban property rights, community participation,
gradual decentralization, roads, technology, water, etc. Some o f the successes were due to designs
that responded a strong demand among the beneficiaries, like in the case o f urban property rights.
Another contributing factor to success has been to figure out the casual chain needed to deliver o n the
intended results before designing or restructuring a project. This has been the case o f the health
project. However, when the innovation requires institutional change the likelihood that political
forces delay implementation increases, a factor that has to be accounted for early o n in the design o f
the project.
Delays iiz the iniplemeiztation of the investment program reduce its effectiveness and can cramp the
overall reform agenda. The initiatives introduced under the adjustment operations, be it under
decentralization, competitiveness or inclusion, require most often building up institutions, which can
only be done w i t h time and technical assistance. Implementation delays in technical assistance or
investment may end up rending the reform initiatives ineffective. M o v i n g forward the future CAS
needs to take determined actions to improve the effectiveness o f investment lending. Supporting the
government in opening fiscal space w i l l help. Working w i t h other donors around SWAPS w i l l also
help. But, this requires improving further public expenditure management and procurement o f both in
the center and the regions. Additionally, the Bank needs to work with the government and other
donors to remove the barriers that limit the effectiveness in implementing projects financed w i t h
foreign resources.
The Bank may want to re-examine the use of the adjustment irzstrunzeizts to better deal with the
inter-relationships across the reform agendas. For instance, progress in social sector reform has
been a determining factor in the advance o f the decentralization agenda. An alternative design o f the
two parallel adjustment operations could perhaps have helped advance further both effective
decentralization and social sector reform.

As the institutional set-up comes into place, adjustment operations should be increasingly focused
on outcomes. During period o f institutional build-up, there i s a tendency for adjustment programs to
focus on steps rather than results, as has been the case in Peru during the last CAS. Rather than trying
to achieve results by mandating them through adjustment operations at times, i t i s best to work o n
achieving them through technical assistance.

Focus on outcomes or results to be effective need to be complemented with attention to delivery
mechanisms. There has been an increasing focus in the Bank’s Peru program o n results w i t h some
b o l d proposals to manage the transfer o f responsibilities in decentralization or to advance the social
reform agenda. (These two are in fact interconnected.) This tension i s felt especially in
decentralization. The next C A S can assist the government by helping identify credible options to
advance effectively decentralization while improving o n the delivery o f social services.

80

Analytical work that nourishes the dialogue with government and is aligned with the overall
development objectives has been effective. This practice can be formalized as programmatic AAA,
where the teams provide on demand the government w i t h timely shorter pieces within an overall
agreed strategic framework. This should be possible n o w given the abundance o f substantive selfstanding analytical work.
When achieving results require multiple complementary iiiterventiorzs, designs have to take
account of these interconnections early on. For instance, higher increases in the profitability o f
economic activity in agriculture are obtained when interventions in roads, irrigation, transportation,
etc. are complementary. Therefore, project design should either take account o f this cross-externality
up-stream (coordinating areas o f interventions, delivery times, beneficiary targets, etc.) or design
integrated operation based o n a geographical approach, when a sound institutional framework allows
for it.
As the scope of World Bank Group engagement in Peru increases, the delivery capacity of the
institution needs to be buttressed, including tighter coordination between the members of the
Group.

ANNEX E
SUMMARY OF PERU’S POVERTY ASSESSMENT (2005)
Peru faces h i g h levels o f poverty and inequality. In 2004, just over h a l f o f Peru’s
1.
population was poor and about 20 percent were extremely poor. Although regional comparisons are
difficult due t o the use o f different poverty lines across countries, Peru’s poverty levels are below
those o f Ecuador and Colombia, but above those o f Argentina and B r a z i l based o n a US$2/day
notably
poverty line. Poverty levels are significantly higher in rural areas, w h i l e urban areas-most
metropolitan Lima-are
the most unequal. Inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, stood at
0.43-below the L a t i n American average o f 0.52, but s t i l l high by international standards.
2.
Poverty has been slow to respond t o the country’s impressive economic g r o w t h in recent
years. After improvements during the 1990s, poverty increased in the wake o f the 1998 economic
crisis, while extreme poverty remained stable. The economic recovery since 2001 has h a d a strong
positive impact in reducing extreme poverty, but progress o n poverty rates has been l i m i t e d t o rural
areas.

A m a i n focus o f this assessment is to explain why growth has n o t translated i n t o m o r e rapid
3.
poverty reduction. The first reason i s simply that poverty reduction takes time, particularly
considering the pattern o f economic volatility in Peru over the past several decades, w h i c h makes
businesspeople reluctant t o invest in job-creating endeavors. As well, in the wake o f the high
investment years in the 1990s followed by the 1998 crisis, many businesses have excess production
capacity that i s only now, after five years o f growth, being worked out. Thus, the good
macroeconomic management o f recent years i s beginning to show fruit in terms o f poverty reduction
and j o b creation, and this will l i k e l y accelerate if the government keeps in place sound
macroeconomic policies.
4.

This annex also points to a number o f obstacles that inhibit economic growth f r o m leading
t o greater poverty reduction in Peru, and w h i c h should b e addressed by government p o l i c y reforms.
G r o w t h has been focused o n natural resource extraction industries, w h i c h are highly capital-intensive
and generate few jobs, and in the rural agricultural and urban informal employment sectors, w h i c h are
characterized by l o w productivity and, therefore, l o w wage growth. Strengthening the linkage
between growth and more, better-paid jobs requires micro-level p o l i c y interventions t o increase
incentives t o formal-sector employment and diversify economic activity into more labor-intensive
areas, such as non-traditional exports. W h i l e this diversification has begun-as
evidenced by the
rapid growth o f non-traditional exports in recent years-further policy reforms can help this process
along. These reforms should be accompanied by measures to boost human capital and access to
public services by the poor, thereby increasing equity in economic opportunity.
The nature, distribution and evolution of poverty

5.
In 2004, just over h a l f the Peruvian population was in poverty,33 w h i l e about one-fifth was
in extreme poverty (see Table 1). Poverty i s significantly higher and deeper in rural compared to
urban areas. Rural poverty stands at 72 percent and extreme rural poverty i s 4 0 percent, w h i l e in
urban areas the rates are 40 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Poverty i s also higher and deeper in
the Sierra and the Selva compared to the Costa.34 M o s t o f the regional variation in poverty rates can
be attributed to variation in household characteristics and in access to basic services and road
infrastructure, rather than to geographical differences, such as altitude and temperature. In other
This report bases poverty rates on consumption as opposed to income, because consumption tends to stay
more stable over the course o f a year, and also because consumption tends to be reported more accurately
than income on household surveys.
34. Peru i s commonly divided into three geographic regions: “Sierra” (mountains), “Selva” (jungle), and
“Costa” (coast).

Poverty increased significantly as a consequence o f the 1998 economic crisis and has
6.
remained stable around i t s n e w post-crisis level afterwards, while extreme poverty was unaffected by
the crisis and has improved since 2001. These findings suggest that w h i l e poverty has been slow to
react to economic growth, this reaction has begun and i t has had the greatest impact o n the poorest o f
the poor.
7.
The evolution o f the national poverty rate, however, hides important differences across
urban and rural areas and across regions. W h i l e poverty rose between 1997 and 2000 in b o t h urban
and rural areas, i t remained stable in the former but declined in the latter between 2001 and 2003 (see
Table 2). Similarly, after generalized increases across regions due t o the crisis, poverty continued to
increase slightly in Lima, while i t improved in the Selva and remained stable in the rest o f the
country.

By contrast, the evolution o f extreme poverty was similar across urban and rural areas and
across regions during this period. Extreme poverty remained stable in 1997-2000, and improved
91

steadily in 2001-2004 (see Table 3). Improvements in extreme poverty were concentrated in rural
areas and among the poorest departments, including Ayacucho, Apurimac, Cuzco y Cajamarca.
Significant improvements can also b e seen in the poverty gap and severity during this period, w h i c h
declined f r o m 20.9 t o 18.5 and f r o m 10.7 to 8.9, respectively, during 2001-2004.
9.
Poverty as measured by the Unsatisfied Basic Needs index (UBN) has declined steadily
during the last 10 years as access to basic services and infrastructure expanded. The fraction of the
population w i t h at least one UBN has fallen f r o m 57 in 1993 to 40 percent in 2003. Progress has been
significant in both urban and rural areas, as the UBN has declined f r o m 42 to 25 and f r o m 9 0 t o 7 1
percent in urban and rural areas respectively during this period. M o s t o f this decline, however, took
place during the 1990s, before public investment levels were cut significantly, leading t o a slow-down
in progress o n access to basic services.

Growth and Poverty: An Overview

11.
The relationship between economic growth and poverty i s weaker in Peru than in other
countries in the world. That is, Peru needs to grow faster than other countries to lower poverty o r
even t o prevent i t f r o m increasing. In recent years this weak relationship between growth and poverty
has been a direct consequence o f the nature o f economic growth in Peru, w h i c h has not been
sufficiently broad-based, due to four factors. First, growth in per capita terms was relatively slow
during 1997-2004. That is, although the economy grew, i t could not keep up with population growth.
Income and consumption per capita declined by -1.6 and -14 percent respectively during this period
according to data f r o m the Encuestu Nucional de Hogares (ENAH0).35
12.
Second, growth was biased towards sectors with high capital intensity and l o w demand for
labor, such as mining, o r towards sectors with l o w labor productivity and wage levels, such as
agriculture, although more recently employment levels are n o w growing in other sectors as well, such
as textiles and non-traditional exports. The m i n i n g and agricultural sectors grew at annual rates o f 7.6
and 3.5 percent during 1997-2004. During this period employment in the mining sector grew by 3.6
percent, while employment in the agricultural sector increased by 4.6 percent. Similarly wages grew
at an annual rate o f 12.4 percent in the mining sector, compared to a decline o f 1.8 in the agricultural
sector. Wage growth in the m i n i n g sector, however, i s unlikely to have benefited the poor, given the
composition o f the labor p o o l employed in the sector, w h i c h tends t o b e relatively skilled.

Third, growth has historically been highly volatile. U n t i l the 2001-2005 period, since 1965
13.
Peru h a d never enjoyed more than four consecutive years with growth rates above 3.5 percent, w h i l e
i t has had 13 years o f growth rates below 2 percent and seven years w i t h negative growth rates.
Volatility in turn has translated into high levels o f uncertainty among employers and other economic
agents, undermining incentives to invest and hire n e w workers. This legacy o f volatile growth i s
gradually being overcome through the government’s prudent macroeconomic management and
disciplined fiscal policies.

14.
Fourth, investment and employment creation in Peru have been l o w because there i s a
significant amount o f excess capacity in the productive system resulting from the 1998-99 economic
downturn. The use o f installed capacity has increased since 2000, but there i s s t i l l a significant share
that i s currently underutilized. Approximately 30 percent o f employers declared t o b e using 60
35

.

This contrast with data from national accounts that shows that GDP per capita grew by 2.5 percent during
the same period. However, poverty i s measured using the ENAHO.

92

percent o r less o f their business’ installed capacity in 2003, d o w n f r o m 37 percent in 2000, while 38
percent declared to b e using more than 80 percent, up f r o m 19 in 2000. The latest available data
indicates that average usage o f installed capacity stood at 74 percent in October 2005. Similarly
employers appeared wary about hiring n e w workers.~In 2003, 15 percent o f employers declared t o b e
w i l l i n g to hire new workers and over 20 percent declared t o be willing t o fire existing ones, compared
t o 10 and 30 percent respectively in 2000.

15.
As a result o f the last three factors listed above-economic
volatility, g r o w t h in capitalintensive sectors, and excess capacity-employment
generation although positive has been
insufficient and investment rates have remained low, and as a consequence g r o w t h has failed to
benefit the poor in urban areas. Although employment in firms with more than 10 employees has
recovered since 2000, i t s t i l l remains below pre-crisis levels. Moreover the overall employment rate
has remained constant, o r even declined slightly since 2000, at the same time that t h e composition o f
employment has shifted towards higher informality. The number o f hours worked has also increased
slightly, suggesting that labor needs m a y have been covered through more intensive use o f already
employed workers rather than through n e w hires. Similarly, although investment levels have
increased in real terms since 2003, investment rates have been declining steadily as a percentage o f
GDP since 1998.
16.
The analysis above indicates that macro-level policies t o maintain and strengthen economic
growth, and to reduce uncertainty can ensure that economic growth i s not o n l y sustainable b u t
contributes to poverty reduction. These macro policies are largely in place and should b e continued.
However, to further strengthen the link between growth and poverty reduction, they must also be
complemented by micro-level reforms that will offer greater incentives t o invest a n d hire n e w workers
in b o t h urban and rural areas, and also t o raise the level o f human capital in the workforce and
equalize economic opportunities.
Economic opportunities f o r the u r b a n p o o r
17.
Recent improvements in average urban employment and wage levels have failed to translate
into lower urban poverty rates because they have been concentrated among formal, more educated
workers, employed in larger f i r m s , and have not extended to the informal sector where most o f the
poor are employed. Overall employment (total number o f workers) increased by an annual average o f
4 percent between 2000 and 2004. However, because the labor force participation rate also increased,
the overall employment rate remained constant or even declined slightly during this period. Wages o f
managers and white collar workers in the formal sector increased (on a wage index w i t h 100 as the
base) from 117 to 158 and f r o m 9 4 t o 104, respectively, between 1997 and 2004, compared with a
change f r o m 86 to 89 among blue collar workers.

18.
The lack o f employment and wage gains for the poor has been aggravated by weak linkages
between large and small f i r m s w h i c h have prevented growth among the former f r o m trickling d o w n to
the latter. In 2004, 62 percent o f a l l large f i r m s sold at most 20 percent o f their production t o m i c r o
and small f i r m s and 46 percent bought at most 2 0 percent o f their inputs f r o m these same firms,
compared to 1.2 and 4.1 percent that sold or bought more than 80 percent o f their production and
inputs, respectively, to and f r o m m i c r o and small firms.
19.
Future declines in urban poverty w i l l depend o n the capacity o f the urban economy to
generate more productive, well-paid jobs, particularly in those sectors that employ the poor. The rest
o f this section analyzes and offers p o l i c y recommendations t o tackle existing constraints t o urban
employment creation by large, m e d i u m and small firms, paying special attention t o labor market
rigidities and the role o f labor legislation. Moreover, because most o f the urban p o o r are employed in
small, informal businesses, it also examines and makes recommendations o n incentives for informal
f i r m s t o formalize themselves and the determinants o f productivity o f informal activities.

93

Removing Constraints to’Urban Employment Creation
20.
Twenty-five percent o f a l l manufacturing firms interviewed in the Peru Investment Climate
Survey ( W o r l d Bank, 2003) declared that, if faced w i t h n o constraints, they w o u l d l i k e t o increase the
number o f permanent workers they employed, compared with less than 5 percent that w o u l d decrease
it, and 70 percent that w o u l d maintain i t at its current level. The reasons given for the difference
between actual and desired hiring and firing vary somewhat by firm size. I t i s clear, however, that
legislated non-wage labor costs, firing costs and, t o a lesser extent, uncertainty about future demand
for the f i r m ’ s products constitute the k e y reasons for this difference.
21.
On paper, permanent employment conditions in Peru are good and protection i s high,
compared to other countries in the region and the world. For instance, average firing costs in 1999
were estimated to be equal t o 13.8 average monthly wages, d o w n f r o m 15.0 in 1987, but still
significantly higher than the regional average o f 5.5 or the English-speaking industrialized countries
average o f 1.5. Similarly the legislation protects labor relationships and, t o a lesser extent, access to
social security. These regulations, however, are relatively easy to avoid by using temporary rather
than permanent contracts to hire n e w workers, or by operating in the informal sector. F o r instance
temporary and hourly employment represents 20 percent o f a l l private sector salaried employment and
50 percent o f a l l contract-based employment in Metropolitan Lima.

As a result, labor markets in Peru are de facto flexible, although this flexibility comes at the
22.
cost o f l o w and unevenly distributed employment protection and access to social security. Only 18
percent o f a l l urban employment and 52 percent o f a l l salaried employment i s hired in full compliance
w i t h Peruvian labor regulation, compared to 40 and 60 percent respectively in LAC. Similarly noncompliance with minimum wage equals just under one quarter o f the relevant population in Peru,
while it i s 10 percent in L a t i n America and the Caribbean (LAC). This dichotomy between high
levels o f protection de j u r e and l o w levels o f protection de facto is common to other countries in the
region where enforcement i s weak and the incidence o f informality i s high.

The impact o f labor legislation extends beyond formal permanent employment to
affect overall employment levels and composition, as has been extensively documented in the
literature on Peruvian and other labor markets. T o a large extent these patterns result f r o m
differences in wage and non-wage costs between permanent employment and temporary (and
informal) employment. T w o measures that would reduce these differences without
increasing the relative cost o f formal employment are: (i)
reduce firing costs to increase
incentives to hire, and (ii)
reduce non-wage costs. Providing Incentives for Formalization

23.

24.
Peru’s high level o f informal employment i s costly for households, f i r m s and the
government. L o w productivity among informal businesses translates into lower earnings for those
employed in the sector-average hourly labor income in the informal sector i s 50 percent below that
o f the formal sector, even when similar workers in similar jobs are compared. I n f o r m a l workers also
lack access to employment-linked social protection, such as health and pension benefits o r severance
payments in the event o f j o b loss. Although some o f these workers m a y have voluntarily foregone
such benefits in exchange for higher wages o r more flexibility, more than 50 percent o f the p o o r
working in the informal sector do so involuntarily, according to surveys. Informal firms also face a
number o f costly obstacles, including limited access t o credit, business associations, and government
programs promoting economic activities and exports. F r o m the government’s perspective, noncompliance w i t h labor and sales taxes among informal f i r m s has a negative impact on fiscal revenues.

25.
High levels o f informality and l o w levels o f fcrmal permanent employment creation
can be attributed to slow and costly business registration procedures, complex tax filing
procedures for businesses, and inflexible labor regulation (particularly onerous o n small
firms). Policies directed at lowering (permanent) employment costs were discussed above.

Increasing Productivity of Small Informal Businesses

26.
W h i l e promoting formality in the private sector should b e a priority, it i s also a reality that
the informal sector i s very large in Peru. Approximately h a l f o f the w o r k i n g urban poor are selfemployed, a l l o f them informally, and an additional 30 percent w o r k for micro o r small firms, m a n y
o f w h i c h are also informal. Similarly 40 percent o f a l l informal entrepreneurs (self-employed o r
otherwise) are poor, compared to 15 percent o f formal entrepreneurs. Thus, identifying the
determinants o f the productivity o f informal activities and implementing policies aimed at increasing
this productivity are k e y in order to help the urban poor step out o f poverty.

27.
There i s significant variation in the productivity o f small, informal businesses, where
productivity i s measured as value added per worker. This variation can be attributed t o differences in
entrepreneur, worker and firm characteristics. As a result, lower levels o f productivity among p o o r
entrepreneurs and, consequently, lower wages among their employees can be explained by lower
levels o f education o f both employers and workers, lower levels o f market integration and l o w e r
access to basic infrastructure.
28.
Differences between poor and non-poor entrepreneurs in terms o f business practices and
characteristics are not the product o f independent factors b u t rather are inter-related. F o r instance the
use o f market-oriented practices, and access t o capital and infrastructure are correlated with business
location. Businesses that operate out o f a commercial locale are more l i k e l y t o use some f o r m o f
accounting and to employ a larger share o f p a i d workers than businesses that operate in the street o r
out o f the entrepreneur’s home. In addition access to machinery and other tools i s higher among
businesses in commercial or non-commercial locals than among those run in the street, while the use
o f a vehicle i s m u c h higher among the latter-partly due to its use as a substitute for a proper local.
Finally, running a business f r o m a commercial local i s correlated w i t h higher access to phone and
water services.
29.
Higher levels o f productivity o f informal self-employment and small businesses could then
b e achieved by: (i)increasing the level o f skills o f b o t h entrepreneurs and salaried workers, and (ii)
increasing access to commercial locals and the use o f market-oriented practices.
Economic opportunities for the rural poor
30.
Rural households obtain most o f their income f r o m agricultural activities, but important
differences exist between poor and non-poor households in terms o f their income-generating
strategies. Poor households tend to rely o n agriculture exclusively, while non-poor households tend t o
also engage in non-agricultural activities. Moreover, poor households are more l i k e l y to r e l y o n a
single source o f income, while non-poor households are better able t o diversify income risk by n o t
relying exclusively o n one particular source. Roughly h a l f o f a l l rural households obtain a l l income
f r o m self-employment in the agricultural sector, while the rest combine agriculture with other types o f
w o r k . Poverty rates are significantly higher among those employed in the agricultural sector (80
percent) than among those employed in the non-agricultural sector (60 percent).
31.
M o s t o f the variation in rural household income i s explained by variation in nonagricultural income f r o m salaried employment. Furthermore, the share o f agricultural income
declines as total income increases. Although these stylized facts seem to suggest that non-agricultural
employment provides an exit out o f poverty, in reality most rural households tend t o obtain income
from b o t h the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors-Le.
they rely o n income-generating strategies
rather than on particular sectors o r activities. A household’s ability to implement a profitable incomegenerating strategy determines its poverty status.

95

32.
Participation in these income-generating strategies i s a function o f household characteristics
and endowments.
Better household endowments (such as higher education) and access to
infrastructure and public services allow households to use strategies that include non-agricultural
activities, while ownership o f agricultural assets and lack o f liquidity make i t more costly for
households to abandon strategies that include agricultural activities.
33.
At the household level, b o t h agricultural productivity and labor income are positively
correlated w i t h human capital (such as higher education), access to credit and t o basic services,
telecommunications and road infrastructure. A t the regional level the returns t o agricultural and
salaried activities depend o n the deepness and dynamism o f regional markets and o n overall levels o f
productivity. Population density and access t o infrastructure are higher in the Costa than in other
areas, despite important improvements during the 1990s in the Sierra and the Selva. B o t h factors
could potentially contribute to create more integrated and dynamic markets in rural areas, as w e l l as to
better connect rural and urban areas. Therefore, investments aimed at i m p r o v i n g access t o assets,
services and markets in those areas that are lagging behind must be undertaken in order to overcome
regional differences.
34.
Three important issues must be kept in mind when assessing p o l i c y options for the rural
sector. First, the nature o f rural poverty i s heterogeneous and varies significantly across regions, so
that interventions and projects need to take into account local specificities to ensure m a x i m u m
effectiveness. Second, because land i s scarce relative to the population i t has to support and
agricultural productivity i s low, many o f those currently employed in agricultural activities w i l l have
t o dramatically improve their productivity or abandon agriculture in order to escape f r o m poverty.
This implies that a rural development strategy for Peru must be multi-sectoral and consider the
interaction between agricultural and non-agricultural activities. Third, i t i s important to note that
there already exist several programs in rural areas that support interventions in the areas identified
above and that provide a structure through w h i c h the government can w o r k towards the goal o f rural
inclusive growth. These programs, however, suffer from several problems that need to be addressed
if further interventions are to b e effective.

35.
With the above considerations in mind, three key areas require government action if
the rural poor are to benefit f r o m the economic opportunities generated by overall economic
growth: (i)
integrate rural areas into national markets to increase economic opportunities, (ii)
improve access to credit among rural producers, and (iii)
increase human capital levels in rural areas.
Access to public services and institutions
36.
Access to public services i s a cross-cutting issue, essential to help the p o o r build human
capital and also to protect the vulnerable, b o t h in rural and urban areas. I t i s also an area directly
susceptible to policy choices, and i s hence a l i k e l y target for improvements t o help improve links
between economic growth and poverty reduction. Access t o public services such as health care,
education, and social protection i s l o w among the poor, among indigenous groups, and in rural areas.
The poor are also less l i k e l y than the non-poor t o come in contact with various public institutions,
ranging f r o m central and local government offices to public banks t o the judiciary system.

This report does n o t offer an in-depth analysis o f the education, health and social protection
37.
sectors (such discussion can b e found in Peru: Accountability in the Social Sectors, 2005), but instead
notes some o f the m a i n issues in these areas, specifically as they relate to the problem o f improving
the human capital o f workers seeking t o pull themselves out o f poverty.
38.
The education sector exhibits a number o f critical weaknesses that reduce i t s impact o n the
poor, in b o t h urban and rural areas. On a broad level, many poor people find the opportunity cost
represented by education to be n o t worth it, reducing the demand for education. Because education
quality i s low, and opportunities available after finishing school to b e limited, m a n y families prefer to
have their children w o r k and earn extra income, even if o n l y a small amount, rather than attend

96

school. This i s particularly true in rural areas, w h i c h are underserved by good teachers w h o prefer to
w o r k in urban areas. As well, teacher absenteeism i s very high in rural areas. Indigenous school
attendance i s especially low, in good part because adequate bilingualibicultural curricula for the
indigenous population are n o t sufficiently available. Another problem, also more pronounced in rural
areas, i s the limited supply o f pre-school and secondary school, w h i c h have l o w enrolment rates.

Increasing the quality and coverage o f education w i l l require demand- and supplyside policies such as: (i)
promote increased demand for education, (ii)
improve the allocation
and quality o f teachers, (iii)
improve the supply and quality o f bilingual education, and (iv) increase
39.

the supply o f pre-school and secondary education.

40.
The health sector also faces b o t h demand- and supply-side obstacles to having a greater
impact improving the lives o f the poor. The Segitro Integral de Salud (SIS), w h i c h eliminates user
fees by reimbursing public providers o n a fee-for-service basis for a l l variable costs incurred during
the provision o f a basic benefit package (mainly essential drugs and medical supplies), has been an
important step in improving access o f the poor to basic health care, but cost i s still a problem for
m a n y poor people. The indigenous population i s also underserved by the health care system, in part
because not a l l health clinics are sensitive to cultural issues related to health care for the indigenous.
Administrative issues are also a problem: health services are provided by different suppliers in Peru,
including the Ministry o f Health (MSP) and the ESSALUD. The existence o f multiple providers w i t h
different mandates can potentially cause inefficiencies in the allocation o f resources and in the use o f
existing capacity.

41.
As i s the case with education, increasing the quality and coverage o f health services
increase the demand for health services by
requires demand- and supply-side interventions such as: (i)
lowering costs for the poor, (ii)
reduce cultural barriers in health care, and (iii)
increase the efficiency
o f and coordination among public health providers.
Exposure to Risk and Social Mobility
42.
L o w productivity, l o w income levels and limited economic opportunities are n o t the o n l y
barriers the poor must surpass.
Restricted capacity t o hedge against risk through income
diversification and to save makes the poor more vulnerable to shocks. Similarly l o w levels o f social
mobility, measured as the correlation between parental background and children’s outcomes, tend to
perpetuate existing inequalities in terms o f income and endowments.

Risk and vulnerability
43.
Approximately 20 percent o f a l l households reported that they suffered a shock in 2003.
B o t h poor and non-poor households were subject t o shocks and were l i k e l y to lose income and assets
as a consequence o f these shocks. Economic shocks were more prevalent in urban areas, w h i l e
natural disasters were more frequent in rural areas. In addition, within urban and rural areas, p o o r
households were more likely to experience natural disasters and accidents, w h i l e non-poor households
were more l i k e l y t o suffer economic shocks.

44.
In coping with shocks, poor households tended t o use behavioral strategies, such as
increasing labor supply or cutting down consumption, while non-poor households were more l i k e l y to
rely o n assets-based strategies, such as reducing savings, o r market-based strategies, such as
requesting a loan o r cashing an insurance policy.

45.

The strategies implemented by the poor were less effective than those of the non-poor in
helping households overcome the impact o f shocks. There are limits t o the effectiveness o f the
behavioral strategies used by the poor since individuals can o n l y w o r k so m a n y hours and since i t i s
difficult to bring consumption under the subsistence level. Households that are closer to these limits

97

at the time o f a shock will find i t harder to overcome i t s effects. Because these households tend t o be
the neediest, this creates a vicious circle o f poverty and vulnerability. Consequently, interventions
aimed at increasing poor households’ capacity t o save and t o access financial markets, as w e l l as their
access to effective safety nets can go a l o n g w a y in breaking this vicious circle.

46.
Enabling the poor help themselves in the face o f shocks will require interventions aimed at
broadening their assets base, increasing their access to financial services and instruments, and
facilitating the use o f income o r catastrophe insurance. Further, public-sector safety nets for the poor
should improve targeting and their ability to react quickly to crises.
Social mobility

47.

Social mobility, measured as the relationship between parental and children’s
characteristics and proxied by education and occupational m o b i l i t y i s l o w and persistent in Peru.
Recent increases in mobility have been the result o f across-the-board gains in educational attainment
and changes in the productive structure o f the economy, rather than the result o f higher equality o f
educational and economic opportunities, and have been concentrated in the middle o f the (income)
distribution.

Fiscal Sustainability and Debt ManaPement
Summary
In order t o help reduce Peru’s public debt ratio and risk o f crisis even further, the Government will
need to continue implementing sound expenditure and revenue policies t o strengthen i t s fiscal stance.
These efforts should be complemented with continuing improvements in public debt management, in
particular with the deepening o f the local currency debt market in order t o address the substantial
currency exposure o f the debt portfolio. This should b e considered a p o l i c y priority as current
favorable conditions m a y retract and the m o v e o f the monetary authorities towards domestic
objectives m a y increase the volatility o f the nominal exchange rate. In this case, a resilient domestic
debt market m a y prove useful; however, the government’s increased reliance o n the domestic market
will require improving the functioning o f the primary market and promoting the reforms required to
have active and liquid secondary markets.

I. Background
A. Debt Trends
1.
Peru’s debt levels have been o n a declining trend. The total gross stock o f Peru’s public
debt3‘ declined f r o m over 63 percent o f G D P in 1993 to about 40 percent in 1997. The debt ratio
increased to about 50 percent in 1999 and declined again in 2005 to 38.5 percent o f G D P (Figure 1
and see also Table 1-1 in Annex I,which includes general government historical debt ratios for a set o f
c o ~ n t r i e s ) . ~These
~
trends were mainly as a result o f improvements in fiscal balances at different
levels o f government during the economic expansions o f 1995-97 and 2003-05 (Figure 2), increased
privatizations, and revaluation o f the local currency during 2001-05. These occurrences are in line
with a study o n emerging market debt dynamics that finds that primary fiscal surpluses and real G D P
growth were the m a i n contributors to reductions in the debt-to-GDP ratio in a set o f 2 1 countries f r o m
the period 1991-02.j8 The same variables seem to explain the reduction o f external debt-to-GNP ratio
in the case o f debt defaulthestructuring countries whereas for non-debt defaultirestructuring countries
the explanatory variables are net repayments and output growth.39

~~

There are several types of public sector liabilities other than “debt.” The following terminology i s adopted
throughout this paper: (a) direct-explicit liabilities are liabilities established by law or contract and include
“full faith and credit” debt, expenditures prescribed by budget law, and claims for services rendered (the
timing and amount o f these liabilities may nevertheless be affected by contingencies); (b) direct-implicit
liabilities are liabilities on which it i s presumed, with good probability, that the government will make good,
but without a legal obligation to do so; (c) contingent-explicit liabilities are recognized in legally binding
documents, but the extent and timing o f payment hinges on uncertain future occurrences; and, (d)
contingent-implicit liabilities refer to an expectation that government will accept a liability without having
a legal obligation to do so. For more details on the classification of public sector liabilities, see Budgeting
for Fiscal Risks, by Allen Schick, World Bank, September 1999.
Net debt i s total gross debt minus domestic public debt held by a l l public sector entities. The evolution o f
debt aggregates in the last decade i s discussed with reference to gross aggregates because estimates o f net
debt in Peru are not available.

The general government and the non-financial public sector (NFPS) have posted a series o f
improving balances, strengthening f r o m -2.8 percent o f G D P and -3.3 percent o f G D P respectively in
2001 t o about -1 percent in 2005 (Figure 2). These balances reflect increases in revenues and t o less
extent declining expenditures. On revenues, tax collection improved since 2002 due t o transitory
factors such as the increase in Peru’s export prices, economic growth and the tax reform enacted in
200240. In 2005, total revenues reached an estimated 18.6 percent o f GDP, up f r o m 17.4 percent in
2001. On the expenditure side, total general government expenditures decreased to 19.5 percent o f
G D P in 2005 f r o m an average o f over 2 1 percent o f G D P in 1999 and 2000.

B. Debt Structure and Risk Analysis

3.
The estimated 2005 total public debt in Peru stands at US$30 b i l l i o n (38.5 percent o f GDP):
US$22.5 b i l l i o n (28.8 percent o f GDP) i s external and the remaining US$7.5 b i l l i o n (9.7 percent of
GDP) is domestic (see Figure 1 and Table q4'.External debt thus represents 75 percent o f the total,
but the total funding raised in foreign currencies i s even higher since more than 22 percent o f the
domestic debt i s denominated in dollars.

The issuance o f dollar-denominated liabilities in the local market i s a reflection o f the
financial dollarization process underway in the Peruvian economy since the early 1990s. Conscious
o f the increased vulnerabilities due t o dollar-denominated public and private sector debt, the
authorities have adopted a number o f measures to gradually reverse this process, including actions to
promote a broader and deeper market local currency for government securities.
5.
The greater use o f local currency instruments started in 2001 and has accelerated since 2003
(through the Programu de Creadores de Mercado), as evidenced by the greater size and longer terms
of local currency bonds. However, because o f the large debt stock relative to the borrowing flows,
external debt in Peru i s s t i l l dominant (see Figure 5).

O f the total debt, 41 percent has a floating interest rate, while most o f the remaining 59

104

11.
With 84 percent o f the total debt denominated in foreign currencies, currency risk i s the
authorities’ main concern. T o reduce currency risk, the debt management unit i s developing a market
for securities in soles and i s gradually changing the portfolio’s currency m i x . The share of local
currency debt has risen from 8 percent t o 16 percent in the last three years. Issuance o f dollardenominated debt in the domestic market was suspended since 2000 when dollar-denominated debt
accounted for over 80 percent of the domestic debt; by September 2005 this percent h a d fallen to
under 25 percent. M o r e recently, a portion o f the external bonds i s being refinanced with local
currency bonds. An illustration o f the government’s efforts in this regard i s the debt exchange
conducted in 2005 w h i c h allowed to redeem US$262 m i l l i o n w o r t h o f dollar-denominated bonds in
exchange for bonds in soles ( S i . 851 million), including a b o n d with a 10-year maturity; and an
additional US$119 m i l l i o n exchange o f dollar-denominated bonds for inflation-indexed bonds (VAC)
maturing in 2024.
12.
Going forward currency risk m a y increase i f B C R P lessens i t s intervention in the exchange
rate market and engage a monetary p o l i c y more oriented towards domestic goals43. In addition, a
downturn in commodity prices, or, a relaxation o f capital controls, m a y result in net foreign currency
outflows that w o u l d pressure the exchange rate. G i v e n i t s currency structure, this clearly represents
the debt portfolio’s chief exposure.

13.
Refinancing risk i s benign, and there i s little concern about the potential impact o f 2006
presidential elections. With the exchange o f internal debt and the prepayment o f some Paris Club
obligations, the borrowing requirements for 2006 are moderate. Close t o 20 percent o f outstanding
Paris Club debt to b e refinanced in the market between 2005 and 2009 have been prepaid with the
proceeds o f long-term paper, h a l f o f w h i c h was issued in local currency. As a result o f the exchange
referred to above and the replacement o f external debt, the average maturity o f the domestic debt
portfolio increased f r o m 5.9 years to 8.9 years44.
14.
The debt management strategy has also significantly reduced interest rate risk. On the one
hand, pre-financing and substituting short-term maturing Paris Club loans by long-term fixed-rate
bonds has reduced the share o f debt that will be re-priced in the next few years. On the other hand,
there is a consistent drive to increasing the share o f fixed rate debt, not o n l y using the n e w borrowing
but also through interest rate swaps o n existing debt45. The percentage o f fixed-rate debt has
increased from 47 percent in 2002 to 59 percent in 2005.
C. Key issues for debt sustainability, debt management and debt market development

15.
Following f r o m above discussions, a number o f k e y questions can be asked f r o m a p o l i c y
maker’s standpoint: (i)
Taking into account the potential impact o f a downturn in the economy driven
by the end o f the current external boom, i s the debt fiscally sustainable under the current fiscal
policy stance? (ii)G i v e n the potential for higher funding needs (end o f current external boom) and
the market’s limited capacity to absorb domestic debt, how can debt management practices
contribute to improving debt sustainability? and (iii)Taking into account that the domestic debt
market i s relatively small and illiquid and that macroeconomic o r financial shocks m a y result in a debt
market squeeze, what can be done to ensure the government has sustained and increasing access
to funding in local currency in the domestic market? The following sections attempt t o answer
these questions.

11. DEBT Sustainability

16.
Public debt in Peru has improved considerably, decreasing to 38.5 percent o f GDP in 2005.
The primary balance has steadily improved from a deficit o f 0.8 percent o f GDP in 2000 to a surplus
o f 1.3 percent in 2005, and the government i s forecasting primary surpluses averaging 1.4 percent for
the rest o f the decade. The results o f an analysis o f Peru's debt determinant^^^ (see Table 1 and Figure
4) show the positive strong contribution o f Peru's real growth during periods o f economic expansions:
from 2001-2005, the growth effect contributed to about a 9 percentage point decrease in the debtiGDP
and to a decrease o f about 8 percentage points in the 1995-98 period. A revaluation effect contributed
to about a 5 percentage point decrease in the debtiGDP ratio from 2001-05, whereas in the 1995-98
period, i t only contributed to about a 1 percentage point decrease. Privatization proceeds greatly
contributed to the decrease in the debt ratio in 1995-98 by transferring not only assets but liabilities to
the private sector, but their impact has declined with the slowing o f the privatization program after
2000. Other factors captured by the residual o f the model accounted for a 4 percentage point decrease
and a 5.6 percentage point decrease in 2005 and 1997, respectively, and could be attributed to the
reduction o f the Paris Club debt in September 2005 and the restructuring o f Brady Plan debt in 1997.

T o analyze whether the government current primary surplus forecast i s enough t o ensure
fiscal sustainability o f the public sector debt and t o arrive at p o l i c y recommendations, this section: i)
estimates the primary fiscal balances necessary t o achieve desired debt t o G D P targets by the year
2010; ii)conducts sensitivity analysis to account for a slowdown in economy activity and increasing
interest rates; and iii)includes foreign currency exposure risk.

18.
Table 4 shows the required primary balances to achieve different debt-to-GDP ratio targets,
assuming a 2005 starting point public debtiGDP o f 38.5 percent, nominal interest rate o n total public
debt o f 5.5 percent, inflation o f 2.5 percent, and real G D P growth rate o f 5 percent, and thereafter
assuming constant annual growth and real interest rate. If growth in coming years i s a l o w 2 percent
o f G D P annually and a real interest rate o f 5 percent, a primary surplus o f 2.7 percent i s required to
achieve a target public debt ratio o f 30 percent o f GDP by 2010. Under the same growth and real
interest rates, a primary surplus o f 3.5 percent o f G D P i s needed to bring public debt d o w n t o 25
percent o f G D P by 2010, or a primary surplus o f 4.5 percent t o achieve public debt levels o f 20
percent o f G D P by 2010.
19.
Under a higher growth scenario o f 5 percent o f G D P per year, annual primary surpluses o f 1.4
percent of G D P are needed t o achieve the public debt target o f 30 percent o f G D P by 2010; a 2.1
percent of G D P primary surplus t o reach public debt o f 25 percent o f G D P by 2010; o r 3.1 percent o f
GDP primary surplus to reach a public debt o f 2 0 percent o f G D P by 2010.

In Table 5, the same exercise i s performed with interest rates gradually increasing t o 8 percent
by 2008 and remaining at that level in 2010, Assuming annual primary surpluses o f 1.4 percent o f
G D P and growth at 5 percent o f G D P (the Government’s latest projections for the next five years), the
debtiGDP ratio could go below 30 percent o f G D P by 2010. However, Table 5 also shows an
alternative scenario, where Peru posts a l o w primary surplus average o f 0.5 percent o f G D P (the
primary surplus average from 2001-2005), and the economy grows at 2 percent. Under this less
optimistic scenario and with increasing interest rates, the debt/GDP ratio w o u l d actually increase to
about 4 1 percent by 2010.47

. Contingent liabilities are not included in these scenarios. Including the present value of contingent
liabilities estimated by the Ministry of Finance to be about 10 percent of GDP in 2005 would require primary
surpluses of 3.1 percent to achieve a 27 percent debt/GDP ratio and 3.5 percent to achieve a 25 percent
debt/GDP ratio by 2010.

External debt as a percent o f total
public debt i s declining, but currency risk s t i l l i s one o f the major concerns in Peru's fiscal
sustainability. I n this section, foreign exchange risk i s accounted for, and we try to benchmark the
risk o f government debt. Figure 9 shows the results o f taking into account exchange rate risk by
including stochastic shocks to the nominal exchange rate, using the same assumptions as in the
baseline scenario in Table 5, above (5 percent GDP growth, 2.5 percent inflation, 3.7 percent
monetary base, and 1.4 percent o f GDP primary surplus). The fiscal sustainability pathsd9 were
derived after 1000 simulated debt paths that depend on random draws o f the sol/$ exchange rate.
Assuming a constant 76 percent share o f external dollar denominated debt, in 44 percent o f the
simulations, debt/GDP ratio i s above 30 percent by 20 10, and only in about 5 percent o f the draws the
debt to GDP ratio goes below 25 percent.
Under a less optimistic scenario,
with 2 percent annual real GDP growth
and 0.5 percent primary surplus, the
debt/GDP ratio paths change dramatically
(Figure 10). In none o f the simulations the
debt/GDP goes below 30 percent, whereas
in 55 percent o f the outcomes debt
increases above 40 percent o f CDP,
indicating that the debt/GDP ratio could in
fact increase under a combined scenario o f
l o w growth, l o w primary surpluses and a

In conclusion, the official forecasts for the next five years o f an average o f primary surplus o f
about 1.4 percent o f GDP5’ and growth o f 5 percent o f GDP puts Peru’s debt/GDP ratio on a
downward trend, and Peru could very well reach levels o f less than 30 percent o f GDP by 2010.
Given the good external conditions, growth in the rest o f the decade could be as strong as i t has been
in the last two years. However, if global conditions should change, and the scenario turns less
positive, leading to a slowdown in economic activity and lower primary surpluses, Peru’s debt path
changes .
25.
Although the current debt to GDP ratio o f about 39 percent may be thought o f as an
acceptable level for Peru, research has shown that high levels o f debt can have significant negative
impact on g r ~ w t h . Other
~’
authors have found that countries with high inflation and default history
have higher risks o f a debt crisis even with low external debt levels o f 15 percent o f GNP.52
Furthermore, I M F research suggests that the conditional probability o f a crisis i s zero with debt levels
of less than 18.7 percent o f GDP and increases to 10 percent at debt levels above the 18.7 percent
threshold5’. I n Latin America, only Chile has reached levels o f debt to GDP below the given
thresholds. The recent crisis in Argentina and the Dominican Republic illustrate the fact that debt to
GDP ratios of 40 and 27 percent cannot be considered as safe levels (See Fig 11-13 in Annex I).In the
case of Peru, further declines in debt to GDP ratio can be beneficial, and ultimately, fiscal surpluses
must be achieved according to the government lifetime budget constraint to ensure fiscal
sustainability.

Debt Sustainability Recommendations

26.
Fiscal surpluses and growth are the most important factors in Peru’s debt dynamics and
are key to debt sustainability. The country‘s fiscal stance i s a crucial policy lever that the
Government can utilize to manage i t s debt dynamics.

noted in the scenarios above, the continued generation o f primary surpluses i s essential t o bring d o w n

given the facts that safe thresholds o f debt t o G D P ratio are lower for emerging market countries.

The Government should f i r t h e r minimize the debt risks by continuing to modernize
debt management, as discussed in the next sections.

In 2005, the middle office (MO) was reorganized and a front office (FO) i s being built. The
M O was expanded to strengthen the analytical w o r k leading to the preparation o f a b o r r o w i n g strategy
and to help promote debt market development. The creation o f the FO will be instrumental in the debt
management office’s ability t o execute debt operations and to provide critical input in the preparation
o f the borrowing strategy. Last year, Ci-idito Publico modified i t s organizational structure and
changed i t s name to Direccion Nacional de Endeudamiento Publico (DNEP) t o reflect the broader

indebtedness o f sub-sovereigns, guarantees and concessions, and contingent liabilities.

loans. W h i l e important steps have been taken to increase the share o f local currency funding, currency
exposure remains high and i s the chief financial risk o f the debt portfolio. This exposure needs to be
addressed given the potential increase in exchange rate volatility that m a y result f r o m changes in
monetary policy and/or by a change in the conditions o f the external sector.
32.
G o i n g forward, the m a i n challenge for the debt unit consists in putting together a strategy t o
address the portfolio foreign currency exposure in a w a y that i s consistent w i t h the macroeconomic
environment and with the pace at w h i c h the domestic debt market i s developing. This will require: (i)
enhancing the formality o f the decision making process; (ii)bolstering the capacity t o analyze
alternative borrowing strategies, including the short end o f the curve; and (iii)
strengthening the unit’s
capacity for execution, recording and bookkeeping, especially with regard to derivatives.
Debt Management Recommendations
Formalize a debt management strategy. The major p o l i c y decisions determining the
33.
structure o f the public debt portfolio are taken in a somewhat informal manner by high level
authorities within the MEF. Without formal mechanisms for deciding o n the debt strategy, the
Government’s might be unable to maintain a medium-term course oriented towards clearly defined
debt management objectives.

34.
A more institutional decision making process could b e thought o f in w h i c h a proposal i s
drafted by the M i d d l e Office and the ultimate decision i s taken by the Minister with the help o f a Debt
Management Advisory Committee. The Committee w o u l d debate the proposals prepared by the debt
unit. Other countries’ experience could shed light o n the structure o f the Committee. An initial step,
which has already been undertaken, i s documenting the current debt strategy.”
35.
The possibility o f B C R P integrating the debt management committee as a mechanism o f
coordination should be considered. Currently, the debt unit i s o n l y responsible for a borrowing
strategy in the medium and long end o f the yield curve. The short-end i s left to the BCRP, w h i c h
issues i t s o w n C D s with maturities up to 3 years. The committee could be the mechanism o f
coordination for developing an integrated strategy for the whole y i e l d curve and t o avoid potential
conflicts. A p l a n could be prepared t o transition towards conducting monetary p o l i c y in the
secondary market in a few years f r o m now.
36.
Bolster analytical capacity to develop a debt management strategy. The current debt
management strategy i s rather intuitive and could be better supported by the systematic analysis o f
cost and risk. W i t h this in mind, the M i d d l e Office has developed a stochastic m o d e l t o quantify cost
and risk, however i t s specification could be simplified and the model output needs t o b e tested. M o r e
importantly, the analytical framework for the strategy design needs to explicitly incorporate
macroeconomic constraints and market development considerations. A thorough understanding o f the
w a y in w h i c h macroeconomic and market considerations can be included in the strategy design i s
fundamental to decide o n the pace at w h i c h the share o f domestic currency debt can be increased.
37.
Strengthen the debt management unit’s capacity for executing and recording
transactions. At present, the Front Office i s unprepared for h i g h level activity o f issuance, exchanges
and hedge operations in the domestic and the international capital markets. Developing and
implementing a training program, including the functioning o f financial instruments and financial
markets, market intelligence, syndications, etc, w o u l d boost the unit’s capacity and w o u l d allow the
Front Office t o contribute to the formulation o f the debt management strategy. The latter i s critical in
the case o f Peru, given the embryonic state o f domestic market development.
38.
The Back Office (BO) i s not fully prepared to process hedging operations transacted by the
debt unit. Systems are outdated, inefficient and cannot account and monitor derivatives. T o upgrade
Back Office functioning, the current processes should be assessed and reengineered according to

55

. See Annual Program for Public Debt and Debt Management 2006-2008, August 2005
111

international sound practice. Subsequently, the I T systems could b e redesigned in line with the n e w
processes and a training program for the staff could b e prepared.

Debt Market Development

39.
Since 2001, MEF has made significant strides in developing a domestic government b o n d
market, W i t h i n an overall framework o f strong economic performance and fiscal discipline, BCRP's
monetary policy o f inflation targeting accompanied with a managed float through dollar purchase and
soles sterilization have reduced volatility in interest and foreign exchange rates. This provided a
favorable background to allow local capital market t o p l a y a small but growing role in funding MEF
financing needs (Figure 6), and building a soles yield curve. With consistent improvements in
macroeconomic stability, MEF started to tap the domestic debt market, introduced D u t c h auctions in
2002, focused initially o n two and three year maturities, then started t o build longer term instruments.
The process o f domestic debt market development got a boost in 2003 through the introduction o f the
primary dealership system (Creadores de Mevcado). Currently, auctions are h e l d m o n t h l y after
consultation with market participants. Sol-denominated, fixed-rate bonds have up to 15 year terms,
and sol-VACs extend up to 30 years. This trend i s having the side effect o f providing the financial
system w i t h a soles reference curve, despite the high degree o f financial dollarization.
40.

Prior t o 2000, the only domestic public bonds were bank-restructuring, privately-placed and

US dollar denominated. By December 2004, the domestic bonds outstanding have become m o s t l y
market issues (Figure 12), denominated in soles (or soles VAC), w i t h semi-annual coupon payments
and are fungible to limit the number o f different bonds outstanding and t o allow for a larger stock
under each line.

MEFi D N E P worked in 2002 o n the comprehensive design o f domestic bonds instruments
and issuance process. Market participants had a negative perception o f government credit risk due to
the absence o f an organized market-based set o f instruments. D N E P decided to adopt a primary

112

dealer (PD) system t o foster the development o f the domestic market. PDs’ incentives vs. obligations
in Peru are detailed in the Reglamento de Creadores de Mercado. D N E P also considers using active
exchanges t o further consolidate the number o f series maturing in any given calendar year for
domestic bonds.
42.
The Peruvian financial market i s highly concentrated, w h i c h i s reflected in Government debt
ownership. There are five AFPs (private pension funds), twelve banks (with the top five represent
close t o 80 percent o f the total), four l i f e insurance companies and four fund managers. W h i l e banks
and M u t u a l funds invest more in instruments with a residual maturity below 5 years, AFPs, foreign
investors and l i f e insurance companies have appetite for long-term nominal and inflation linked paper.
This concentration segments the demand and limits securities trading (see figure 13).
Domestic Government securities outstanding as o f November 2005 represent a lower share o f
43.
banks assets and A F P assets than in comparable countries in the region (Mexico, Colombia and
Chile). This partly reflects the early stages o f the debt market development. Also, investors’ appetite
for Government exposure m a y b e less. Moreover, domestic bonds compete with internationally
issued Peruvian bonds in local investors’ exposure t o Government debt.
44.
Well-functioning securities funding tools, such as repurchase agreement (repo) and securities
lending systems, could increase the liquidity o f the market for Government bonds. SBS has issued a
regulatory clarification and adopted F A S 133 accounting for repos, w i t h t w o possible accounting
schemes. Problems exist w i t h rep0 enforceability in Peru, particularly in the case o f a bankruptcy.
Securities lending requires a special set-up in the custodyiclearing entity CAVALI, in order to
warehouse the lending collateral and unwind the transaction at maturity.

Debt Market Development Recommendations

46.
MEF should ensure the regular issuance of government paper across the curve and
coordinate with other issuers in the public sector. D N E P should not neglect short and m e d i u m
term instrument^.^^ Appropriate supply o f these instruments t o the market could be developed in
coordination with the Public Treasury and B C R P and should be part o f the overall debt strategy.
B C R P should increase its efforts to standardize C D s maturities and minimize the number o f issues in
the market t o facilitate their trading in the secondary
A transition mechanism towards
conducting monetary policy in the secondary market w o u l d be a major step in improving the
functioning o f the primary market.

47.
The Primary Dealers' system has to be reinforced to ensure a minimum liquidity in the
secondary market. Dealers trading volumes outside the resale o f initial offerings are very l i m i t e d
and institutional investors often trade directly with each other. MEF should re-examine and formulate
an adequate and sustainable mix o f incentives and obligations. In particular, the possibility o f paying
a small fee for increased quoting obligations could help develop a guaranteed liquidity cushion to
address minimum investor exit needs without disrupting the market.

48.
M E F and other regulators should continue to push for a well-functioning rep0 and
securities lending mechanism. At present, market makers are heavily restricted t o finance the
trading o f securities in the interbank market, w h i c h i s small, fragmented and concentrated mostly in
overnight, unsecured transactions. This w o u l d change with the development o f a rep0 market w h i c h
could be done in t w o stages: first, a Master Repurchase Agreement (MRA) w o u l d be drafted
reviewing bankruptcy laws as w e l l as the accounting standards; second, a rep0 clearing mechanism
w o u l d b e established at CAVALI in a manner consistent with the legal framework and accounting
rules.

49.
MEF needs to ensure that the financial system has the capacity to manage the risks
arising from holding and trading public debt instruments. In the concentrated and fairly illiquid
securities market, sharp adjustments in asset value could generate a debt market squeeze (e.g.: B r a z i l
in 2003, Colombia in 2002 and M e x i c o in 2004). MEF and SBS should promote stronger risk
management practices o f investors. Also Conasev and MEF should provide regulatory framework for
the voice broker CIMD and Datatec."

50.
The DNEP should continue its recent efforts to establish regular dialogue with the
investors and closely follow the regulatory changes related t o the critically important investor
segments: banks, fund managers, insurance companies, and most importantly private pensions".

56

. Datatec i s a joint venture of B V L and Mexican SIF Garban. 411 market participants praised Datatec's
positive contribution to market development and its excellent operational performance and service. Datatec
supported more than 80 percent o f government securities trading in 2004. It also supports most trading in
BCRP CDs as well as foreign exchange spot and clean interbank.

. Government securities are dematerialized and registered with CAVALI, the central depository.
58
. General debt law specifies that DGCP caters only to debt longer than one year. NoLetras have been issued
in 2004 and Treasury plans for 2005 do not foresee any issuance either, unless a temporary cash flow
mismatches arise.

dates per month.

accounting for 1.5% o f MIGA’s portfolio (1.7% o f portfolio net o f reinsurance). MIGA’s exposure in
Peru has fallen f r o m a US$297.5 m i l l i o n in FY02, due to attrition o f investment instruments
(amortization o f debt, repayment o f capital) o f the insured portfolio. Currently, 85% o f MIGA’s
outstanding exposure remains in the mining sector.
2.

MIGA has been very active in Peru’s m i n i n g industry and i t s due diligence and monitoring
efforts are to ensure compliance o f the projects with Extractive Industries Review principles. Thus,
despite the Agency’s limited staffing, MIGA has been involved in supporting detailed planning and
implementation o f good governance and transparency practices o f foreign mining companies and in
collaborating with local governments o n the enacting o f these principles, as good governance and
transparency are important in creating an enabling environment for private sector operations. In some
cases, this has involved mediation o f claims between the local community and the mining companies,
n o t only in relation to the Antamina mining project, but in other mining investments.
3.
MIGA i s currently underwriting large investments in the mining sector. A s part o f this effort,
MIGA has been working closely with foreign m i n i n g companies and local governments in the country
t o ensure that the f l o w and use o f funds f r o m the m i n e (in projects that benefit the community) i s
transparent and legitimized by the beneficiaries themselves. G i v e n the complexities involved, and the
level o f community support required for MIGA t o m o v e ahead and support these investments (as per
the Extractive Industries Principles), the timing o f the closing o f these projects could occur in the
latter h a l f o f FY07, or maybe in the subsequent fiscal year.

4.

MIGA remains committed to supporting foreign investors in Peru outside the mining sector as
well. The appetite for MIGA coverage, however, will depend o n risk perceptions o f foreign investors.

Annex I
Civil Society Consultation Process
This c i v i l society consultation process for the CPS goes beyond the typical B a n k practice of
holding consultations for the definition o f a full CPS. The presidential elections have generated
a new situation in Peru that has in turn resulted in the need t o engage k e y and n e w stakeholders.
Some examples o n the discussion and group w o r k o f the consultation outcomes at the micro,
mezzo and macro levels i s provided in this annex (sections I,11,111) and other examples o f the
consultation to the youth advisory group o f N e w Voices can be found in section IV.
The objective o f the consultative process was to learn f r o m the good practices engaged in by
C i v i l Society and the campesinos and t o share the principal findings o f the CPS. A w i d e range
o f stakeholders provided information o n their good practices, opportunities and limitations for
development and expressed their ideas concerning (i)
the new challenges in Peru and (ii)
role o f
the WBG in addressing these challenges.
The c i v i l society dialogue process was decentralized and organized into three levels o f
intervention for good practices: (i)
the micro, community and district levels, (ii)
the mezzo,
the macro, national level. The participants were selected based o n their
regional level and (iii)
experiences. U n l i k e p r i o r c i v i l society consultations, the focus o f this dialogue was o n learning
h o w good practices function as opposed to concentrating merely o n the problems generated.
Additionally, the approach sought to identify the new challenges associated with upgrading the
good practices in question.
After the three meetings (micro, mezzo and macro), workshops were h e l d over a t w o and a h a l f
day period with t w o advisory groups o f the WBG Office, one w i t h academics/ think tanks and
the other with the youth advisory group N e w Voices. In addition, a j o i n t IFCiIBRD consultation
exercise w i t h the private sector took place in L i m a during the CPS preparation.
First, a two - day, highly decentralized Workshop was held in Ayacucho (in the Southern
Sierra o f Peru): one Workshop with 72 campesinos leaders o f rural entrepreneurs l e d by the
Yachaqchics and a second Workshop with 7 6 c i v i l society representatives o f the chamber
o f commerce, NGOs, small micro enterprises, networking organizations, the R o u n d Table
Poverty Partnership Forum, and representatives f r o m groups for w o m e n and youth. The
discussion focused o n good practices and income generation efforts amongst individuals
w h o were experiencing growth due to good practices although they remained b e l o w the
poverty line and s t i l l required assistance f r o m a l l relevant actors including the State. The
Yachaqchics (about 800) have decided to overcome poverty and bring development t o the
highland communities above the 3,500 to 4,000 m.s.1. Their future i s based o n t w o
elements: (i)
a vision o f development and democracy, illustrated with a stair o f progress,
and (ii)
the indigenous culture o f the “Ayni” (knowledge sharing). The Workshop resulted
in the selection o f 64 good practices, o f w h i c h 55% were consolidated. The expansion o f
these good practices will reduce poverty and bring development t o the Southern Sierra. The
mapping o f the 37 good consolidated practices and i t is included in Section I .
Second, one day workshop was held in Cajamarca with 50 representatives o f Civil Society
with good practices at the regional level. Participants f r o m a l l over the country came t o (i)
map good practices in poverty reduction and in the decentralization process. The

participants were grouped by regions and discussions and voting took place to determine the
best practices utilized and to select those cases that best illustrate h o w t o combat poverty
and promote decentralization. About 72 good practices, o f w h i c h 53% were poverty
116

reduction cases, were discussed in a group format. As an example, i t i s included in Section
I1 good practices in poverty reduction, highlighting water and sanitation management o f
m i n i n g royalties and economic development.

Third, another consultation took place in L i m a w i t h leaders o f advocacy institutions. About
35 participants discussed the m a i n pillars and clusters presented by the WBG regarding

macroeconomic stability and reduction o f vulnerability, competitive and social inclusion,
basic needs and social development, and institutional development and governance. As an
example o f the discussion o f this consultation, section I11 i s referred to the topic o f
competitiveness. The participants highlighted that for the next 5 years i t i s expected to
remove red tape barriers and speed up public investment in order to promote local
investment in the interior areas o f Peru and concluded that for this purpose, i t is necessary t o
improve competitiveness

Fourth, a meeting with a group o f think tank members and directors o f CIES - Center for
Economic and Social Research; this consultation took place in L i m a w i t h the objective o f
collecting reactions o n the CPS draft; the outcomes o f this dialogue were: (i)
the importance
o f building alliances with the WBG for base line studies, impact research for an analysis o f

project results, studies o n the impact o f good practices, evaluation o f the access o f the poor
t o services; and (ii)
the importance o f developing dissemination and information
mechanisms for the friendly use o f the good practices identified in the CPS preparation
process; (iii)
the group welcomed the openness o f the WBG and requested a continuing
dialogue and partnership.

Fifth, a meeting w i t h the youth network o f the Y o u t h Advisory Group o f N e w Voices was
held to receive comments o n and suggestions for WBG w o r k in the country and collect
feedback o n the pillars and clusters. N e w Voices knows the WBG f r o m the inside and i s
familiar with the portfolio and implementation o f projects in the rural area. Y o u n g people
representing 33 youth organizations f r o m Piura, Cajamarca, Cusco and L i m a got together in
L i m a to discuss the new CPS with the WBG. They proposed indicators for the clusters and
pillars and suggested that the WBG play a more active role in the dialogue process w i t h
Civil Society, youth and academia while acting as a vehicle for knowledge sharing.
Matrixes o n (i)
social development w i t h standards, (ii)
governance, justice and
macro economy and reduction o f vulnerability, (iv) competitiveness
decentralization, (iii)
were examined. As an example o f the r i c h discussion, in Section I V the topics o f
governance and social development with standards are included.
Methodology - the consultation for the CPS was inclusive and involved extensive dialogue
with leaders and representatives o f Civil Society, indigenous I campesino groups, academia,
think tanks, and youth representatives. A participatory methodology was used. The consultation
meetings utilized participatory techniques such as w o r k i n g groups for small discussions and
plenary sessions to present results and general comments. The dialogue w i t h the indigenous /
campesino ‘Yachaqchics’ used the plenary method and exhibition techniques that mirrored a
development marketplace in which each group presented i t s experiences and good practices.
The participants to the M i c r o consultation classified their good practices into three types:
consolidated experiences, potentialities and initial stage efforts. Each group voted and selected
best practices in a consolidated effort to focus analysis o n existing opportunities, the capacity to
use opportunities, the business environment, limitations and proposals for solutions. The
dynamic in the Mezzo and Macro consultations, characterized by fluid dialogue and open
discussion that resulted in consensus conclusions, used working groups and a plenary format for
conclusion presentation. The meeting w i t h think tank members o f CIES was conducted under an
informal conversation format, and the meeting with the youth advisory group N e w Voices
utilized the workshop format.

C i v i l Society Leaders Consultation a t the M a c r o L e v e l in L i m a .

The participants in work discussion worked out three aspects for development: (i)
macro
competitiveness and social inclusion and (iii)
basic needs and social
economic stability, (ii)
development, and (iv) institutional development and good governance. As an example o f the
discussion we present one o f the outcomes o n competitiveness.

COMPETITIVENESS, SOCIAL INCLUSION AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT,

the group focused o n the private sector and its links w i t h public policies and the population.
While the State investment- and to a larger extent private investment- i s located mostly in Lima,
the challenge for the next 5 years i s to remove red tape barriers and speed up public investment in
order to promote local investment in the interior areas o f Peru. For this purpose, it i s necessary to
improve competitiveness in the sectors that provide more employment opportunities in the
regions: agricultural industry, livestock breeding, tourism, and the small and medium industry.

M a i n elements to be developed for this issue: the group identified the following elements: (i)
diversification o f private investment; (ii)
productive road infrastructure and sanitation; (iii)
access
to funding adapted to the rural reality (COFIDE in the Highlands); (iv) generation o f nonfinancial services (technical assistance) and a trust fund; (v) adaptation to technological changes
in those areas that receive the least attention from the government.
Outcomes to b e achieved b y 2011: (i)significant growth o f the regional GDP, (recovering o f
this measurement at regional level); (ii)
Reduction o f poverty incidence (5 1.6% -3 40%), of the
gap (18% -3 9%) and extreme (8.4% -3 5% internal heterogeneity) poverty. T o have an
to increase the percentage o f enterprises and
objective analysis made for these indicators. (iii)
decentralized formal employment; (iv) administrative simplification to help the legal registry o f
the MYPES; (v)recovery o f Peruvian agriculture w i t h a market approach; (vi) labor training
according to the economic reality; (v) universities and training centers to be adapted to the
country's productive reality; (vi) to have an efficient prevention system for environmental
impacts;(vii) decentralized systems for the rational use o f water with inexpensive systems
(treatment and recycling); (viii) to have a coordinated plan system to achieve the millennium
goals for the reduction o f natural resource losses.

Indicators to measure the achievement of the outcomes: (i)
proportion o f the National GDP
for non- traditional products produced outside Lima;(ii) poverty incidence, gap and severity,; (iii)
number o f formal enterprises.; (iv) national and regional employment rate.; (v)deforestation rate.;
(vi) basic sanitation rate.
Regarding partnerships to achieve the expected outcomes, the following i s needed: (i)to
have the learned society participating in the regional development. (Baselines, monitoring,
evaluation and surveillance).; (ii)to work w i t h the Chambers o f Commerce or w i t h a
decentralized CONFIEP.; (iii)
to create links among'the regional entrepreneurs, the (replicate the
CCA); (iv) to set up partnerships w i t h those institutions working on the environmental issue.

ANNEX J
PERU - COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS
UNDER THE NEW POLICY FOR EXPENDITURE ELIGIBILITY
Summary

1.
This note describes the application o f the new policy for expenditure eligibility in World Bank
financing to Peru. The new framework allows the Bank to finance expenditures needed to meet the
development objectives o f the operations i t supports, within an overall framework that addresses risks to
fiscal sustainability and the appropriate use o f Bank resources, in a way that i s consistent with the Articles
o f Agreement. This note, along w i t h pertinent sections o f the CPS which provide background, lays out
new country financing parameters for Peru.
2.
The new policy increases the flexibility to allow the use o f Bank loan proceeds for a number o f
expenditures. I t rests on three guiding principles: (a) the expenditures financed from Bank loan proceeds
are productive; (b) the impact o f operations financed under such loans on the borrowing country’s fiscal
sustainability i s acceptable; and (c) oversight arrangements on the use o f Bank funds are acceptable.

3.
The Government o f Peru has welcomed the increased flexibility that the new Bank policy provides
with regard to eligible expenditures. In view o f Peru’s overall strong commitment to the implementation
o f Bank-financed projects, the Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f project costs. The actual costsharing percentage would be determined during the preparation o f each new project. I t i s expected that
the added flexibility w i l l be used primarily to finance local costs o f investment expenditures and some
taxes and duties related to investments in amounts appropriate to achieve project development objectives
and as agreed with the borrower. Use o f the increased flexibility regarding recurrent cost financing w i l l
be limited and on a case by case basis.

4.
The proposed financing parameters could become an additional tool in helping further improve
portfolio performance and ensure that the Bank’s financial resources to the country have the desired
impact. The added flexibility and ample eligibility afforded by the new policy are expected to enhance
implementation effectiveness. Retrofitting o f existing loans w i l l be done on a case-by-case basis and only
be pursued in cases where the new financing parameters would have a significant impact in improving
project performance.
Background

5.
The Bank’s CAS program (FY02-06) has been designed to support the government’s strategy to
achieve competitiveness, social equity, and strengthen institutions. Bank support has been undertaken
through a lending program o f approximately $230 million per year, split between investment operations
and programmatic adjustment loans. Specifically, the Bank i s financing investment lending in a range o f
poverty-targeted investment loans, including education and health, urban and rural development, and
infrastructure as well as technical assistance loans addressing reform in social sector programs and citizen
participation, competitiveness, justice, and decentralization and municipal development.
6.
The lending pipeline for FY06 i s in the high case since the following CAS triggers have been
achieved: (i)
a fiscal policy and management strategy conducive to increasing debt sustainability in the
medium term as well as a tax revenue/GDP ratio higher than 12.5 percent; and (ii)
policy and institutional
reforms addressing issues o f reform o f state institutions, decentralization policies that incorporate fiscal
and debt sustainability, and actions to increase private sector competitiveness have been successfully
124

launched. T o this end, for FY06 a total o f 15 investment projects are scheduled for a net commitment
amount o f $5 16 million.

7.

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2001 concluded that the
financial tools at the disposal o f Congress and Executive branch comprised (i)robust financial
administration legislation (ii)
highly dedicated staff and (iii)
an effective integrated financial management
system (SIAF). In response to the major recommendations o f the CFAA, three indispensable elements of
a sound fiduciary framework have been implemented including: (1) Strengthening o f the congressional
oversight o f the use o f public funds (2) Increased independence o f the Controller General and (3)
Expansion of the scope and coverage o f the integrated financial management system SIAF.

8.
The latest CPAR prepared in 2000 described Peru’s procurement system as fairly modern and
assessed the country risk as medium. The CPAR recommended a number o f measures to improve the
regulatory framework and harmonize i t with international standards. Although implementation o f several
initiatives the CPAR Action Plan proposed in 2001 remain yet pending, important steps by the
Government were taken and by and large, there are no major concerns regarding public procurement. The
Government has a clear strategic vision for modernizing the system by progressively implementing a fully
electronic marketplace, starting with a system. to handle small purchases but which are considered to have
the least amount o f oversight, and then streamlining i t s supply strategy by procuring certain l o w
valuelhigh quantity items through a “catalogue approach.”
Macroeconomic a n d Fiscal Considerations
9.
The Peruvian economy has made major strides. Inflation has come down to l o w levels, growth i s
solid, and near term prospects are good. Peru has weathered relatively well the shocks that hit the region
in 1998-99 and again in 2001-02. However, the f r u i t s o f macroeconomic stability and growth have not
yet been translated into more employment and poverty reduction. M u c h more remains to be done to
sustain the current growth rate, reduce poverty and crisis proof the economy. Poor provision of public
services, relatively high degree o f dollarization, labor market rigidities, unreliable legal system and
political uncertainty are among the key weaknesses that if not addressed could jeopardize the hard-won
progress.
10.
Since 2001 growth has averaged 4.5 percent a year and inflation has remained l o w under the
inflation targeting framework. This growth has been accompanied by steadily declining fiscal deficits,
which indicates that i t i s not driven by unsustainable fiscal spending, as i t has at times in the past. Fiscal
policy has been prudent, leading to steady improvements in the public accounts. The overall fiscal deficit
has narrowed from 2.2 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 0.3 percent o f GDP in 2005, below the 1.1 percent o f
GDP deficit target originally agreed with the IMF. Since 2003 Peru has made important progress in
reversing the decline in tax revenues that started in 2001. Tax measures included increases in the VAT
and excises rates, a hike in personal income tax rate, an introduction o f a financial transactions tax (ITF),
a broadening o f the base o f the income tax, tariff reductions and the elimination o f corporate tax income
exemptions. In parallel, tax administration measures were introduced to fight tax evasion. Together with
strong growth, these reforms led to an improved tax ratio and tax revenue collection rose to 13.9 percent
of GDP in 2005 from 12.4 percent in 2002. Despite this improvement, Peru’s public finances have been
strained by a relatively low tax take. Fiscal rigidity has also increased since the mid-1990s as wages,
interest, and transfers rose to nearly 80 percent o f central government spending. Thus, while the general
government deficit has been reduced systematically, this has been largely sustained by reductions in
public investment that shrank public investment to 2.9 percent o f GDP in 2003.

11. The Government i s exploring options for fostering public and private investment in infrastructuresuch as private-public partnerships-while preserving macroeconomic stability. Peru has agreed to
125

participate in a program o f pilot case studies examining the linkages between public investment and fiscal
policy, which i s being carried out jointly by the IMF, World Bank and IADB. Furthermore, the
government have stepped up their efforts to implement structural reforms, some o f them recommended by
the PER, C F A A and Decentralization and Competitiveness SALS. Examples o f these efforts are the
reform o f the Cedula Viva public pension regime. This important step w i l l save the government about $5
billion over the next 20 years. Likewise, the recent implementation o f an automatic transfer payment
system (abono en cuenta) w i l l bring substantial fiscal savings as it w i l l allow eliminate payroll
irregularities. The authorities are working on procurement reforms and o n the design o f a monitoring and
evaluation system aimed to improve the quality o f public expenditures. Peru has the difficult challenge o f
pursuing fiscal adjustment while maintaining i t s development programs fully funded and timely
implemented. In this context, the expenditure flexibility proposed by the Bank i s not only timely but w i l l
also bring lower transaction costs.

A. Cost Sharing
Current Practice. Set cost sharing ceilings are based on per capita income o n a rolling three12.
year basis (OP 6.30). To ensure ownership, a minimum Borrower cost sharing o f 10 percent was
established. Decisions regarding the financing percentage and the relative m i x o f recurrent and traditional
investment costs in an individual project are made during project preparation, based o n the technical
requirements o f projects.

13.
Peru’s fiscal position i s strong and the country i s committed to pursue a prudent and strategic
debt management strategy. Application o f the new Bank policy on eligible expenditure w i l l facilitate the
implementation o f Bank projects. I t w i l l allow the Bank and the Government to determine the costsharing ratio for projects that best supports implementation while also retaining country ownership,
sustainability o f project achievements, and leveraging o f Bank funds. The changes are also expected to
facilitate the administration o f projects by reducing the need for the traditional pari passu approach,
because cost-sharing w i l l not have to be at the level o f individual expenditures. Project managers w i l l be
able to focus more on the technical aspects o f project implementation, rather than on financing categories.
Thus, from both an aggregate fiscal point o f view, and from the project implementation perspective, the
Bank’s greater flexibility in financing project costs w i l l help projects to meet their development
objectives.

14.
There are no major concerns on financial management and accountability in Peru. Bank financing
o f projects i s integrated into the national budget process, and overall, the budget process i s well managed.
The government had continued its commitment to improving transparency and access to information and
to promoting better governance and administration o f public finances.

15.
Peru’s development program i s strong; the government has demonstrated full ownership until
now. The country has full ownership o f it development programs, which are fully funded and included in
the budget. However, at times some ongoing investment projects have been delayed due to temporary
shortages and unavailability o f counterpart funds. The government will have to continue showing
evidence o f ownership and commitment in the future, which w i l l be one major concern for the Bank
considering this, i s a new administration. Based on account o f budget and planning processes and project
cost sharing government ownership i s expected. One hundred percent Bank financing could be provided
for some projects and activities with strong evidence o f ownership and commitment.
16.
In most Bank projects the practice o f using counterpart financing w i l l be maintained, in particular
when domestic funds would come from sub-national financial sources. However, i t i s expected that up to
100% Bank financing w i l l be applied to specific types o f expenditures such as financing local
expenditures (public works, domestic goods, domestic consultant services). In these cases, government

126

ownership w i l l be judged by means other than their capacity to shoulder the recurrent costs, including
consistency with the Macroeconomic Multiannual Framework, inclusion in the budget, evidence of
Government-led reforms in the sector, adequate resourcing o f other projects in the sector, and/or broad
ownership and acceptance among stakeholders. Ownership w i l l also be assured by regular discussions by
Bank country management with senior government officials o n portfolio and planned projects.
Summary: Cost Sharing. In view o f Peru’s overall strong commitment to the implementation
17.
o f Bank financed projects, the Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f project costs. The actual costsharing percentage would be determined’ during the preparation o f each new project. The use o f the
increased flexibility on eligible expenditures w i l l be managed in such a way as to lessen the impact o f
counterpart resources delays that may affect the disbursement ratio and probably the amount assigned to
new operations, since the new policy does not provide additional fiscal space. Specific arrangements
would be determined for individual projects, taking into account the project context and the
borrower’s financing f r o m i t s o w n resources o f the sector concerned.

B. Recurrent Cost Financing
18.
Current Practice. Provided for incremental financing o f recurrent costs on a declining basis
(OMS 1.21). Such financing would normally be on a temporary basis for a transition period until a
sustainable fiscal situation could be achieved.
19.
The Peruvian Constitution and Peru’s legal framework limits the financing o f permanent spending
with indebtedness proceeds. Hence only a small proportion o f the Bank’s current portfolio in Peru
involves financing o f recurrent costs. These are normally the reasonable non-salary costs o f operation o f
project implementation units (PIUs) (e.g., rental, gasoline for transport, etc.). While the Bank regularly
finances the compensation o f P I U staff, this i s being paid under the modality o f consulting services
following Bank procedures for selection o f consultants and, as such, has not been considered recurrent
costs, nor subject to a declining scale treatment (around 85 %). Consistent with the Government’s o w n
prudent fiscal stance, Bank recurrent cost financing will remain subject to consideration o f overall
medium-term fiscal sustainability and i s expected to stay broadly within the modest ranges o f recent
years. The Government continuously monitors recurrent expenditures, including those financed by Bank
projects; all recurrent expenditures are integrated into the fiscal program and into the national budget,
they are thus subject to Peru’s overall prudent and sound fiscal management. Human capital financing i s
required to follow strict regulations, including salary ceilings.
Summary: Recurrent Cost Financing. While no specific limit i s proposed for the financing of
20.
recurrent costs in individual operations, Bank financing o f recurrent costs i s expected to remain within the
recent modest ranges and subject to consideration o f medium-term fiscal sustainability and the
sustainability o f project achievements. O n a project by project basis, the Bank may consider financing
recurrent costs and incremental operating costs in certain circumstances, after a careful consideration o f
(i)the sustainability o f project achievements; (ii)implied future budgetary outlays; and (iii)Peru’s
aggregate fiscal position and prospects.
C. Local Cost Financing

21.
Current Practice. In Peru, the Bank has typically supported 100 percent o f total foreign
expenditures and an average o f 85 percent o f total local expenditures. The Standard Disbursement
Percentage (SDP) for consultant services amounted to around 85 percent.

127

22.
For the Bank to provide local cost financing, two tests must be passed. First, financing o f local
investment expenditures requires that the country’s o w n resources and expected domestic borrowing are
not enough to cover the financing requirements for the country’s development program. First, as the
Ministry o f Finance has estimated, the financing for Peru’s development program i s for the FY07-09,
U S $ 6.63 billion, or 15.7 % o f GDP, which exceeds the public sector’s own resources from taxation,
other revenues and expected domestic borrowing. O f total expected expenditure in the coming years
(FY07-09), 43 % i s expected to be domestically financed and 57 % i s expected to be foreign-financed.
Second, the financing o f foreign expenditures alone would not enable the Bank to assist in the financing
o f individual projects. The Bank’s expected operations focus primarily o n projects in health, education,
nutrition, water, governance, infrastructure, environment, fiscal management, competitiveness and other
areas, the former o f which have a high element o f local expenditure. In FY99-04, approximately 85-90
percent o f the Bank’s investment lending disbursement was for local costs, The future Bank portfolio
w i l l likely necessitate a similar level o f local cost financing.
Summary: Local Cost Financing: Since the two requirements for Bank financing o f local
23.
expenditures are met, the Bank can finance local costs in the proportions needed in individual projects.

D. Taxes and Duties
Current Practice. The current policy prohibits financing o f taxes and duties (General Conditions,
24.
OP 12.00).

25.
Currently, the tax and duty incidence financed under typical Bank projects i s estimated to an
average o f around 1 percent. Peru’s tax system i s basically made up o f five taxes: a value-added tax
(VAT); an income tax on legal entities and on individuals; tariffs on imports; a selective excise tax; and a
financial transactions tax. Peru’s income tax ranges from a low 15 percent to a top personal income tax
rate o f 30 percent, in five brackets. The VAT tax rate was increased in the year 2004 from 18 percent to
19 percent. Peru implemented in December o f 2003 a temporary tax, the Financial Transaction Tax (ITF)
o n financial sector debit and credit transactions. The current rate for the ITF i s set at 0.08 percent and
was planned to be reduced gradually to 0.06 percent in 2006 and eliminated in 2007, but the new
government has decided the permanence o f the tax. As regards to the excise system, it includes all the
goods that are traditionally considered to be excisable such as fuels, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and
motor vehicles. Peru also maintains a fairly open trade system with an average tariff rate o f 10 percent.
The trade regime for imports i s reasonably predictable and transparent, without prior licensing, import
quotas or other non-tariff measures affecting imports o f goods. Import tariffs have reduced from 47
percent in 1990 to 10 percent in average in 2005. Currently only four tariff rates are applied, ranging
from 4 percent to 20 percent. A few tariff surcharges remain for a number o f agricultural and food
products, such as rice, sugar, corn, powdered milk and butter.
Summary: Taxes and Duties. Peru has a moderate level o f taxation, and i t s total tax burden
26.
averages 13.9 percent o f GDP. Bank financed projects/activities are taxed at the same rate as the
country’s normal tax rates. There are no taxes or duties that are identified as unreasonable or
discriminatory, and that the Bank would therefore not finance. At the project level, the B a n k would
consider whether taxes and duties constitute a n excessively high share o f project costs. The
flexibility to finance cost o f taxes and duties that the new Bank policy provides w i l l undoubtedly facilitate
implementation o f projects in Peru.

27.
The Bank and the Government o f Peru find that the framework set out above reflects the best
arrangements for Peru. In the medium t e r m i t i s expected that the new flexibility w i l l be used primarily to
finance local costs. As part o f the CPS process, the Bank expects to review the parameters o n
approximately an annual basis, with any necessary adjustments made and processed as appropriate, in
accordance w i t h Bank procedures.

Remarks / Explanation

The Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f project costs. The actual cost-sharing percentage
would be deteiinined during the preparation of each new project. The use o f the increased
flexibility on eligible expenditures will be managed in such a way as to lessen the impact on
the amount assigned to new operations, since the new policy does not provide additional fiscal
space.
However, this would apply on a project basis in exceptional circumstances based on
considerations o f ownership, leverage and transaction cost economies. Under the new policy,
the Bank would finance projects where ownership o f the overall program and at the sector
level i s considered satisfactory. The Bank’s financing share could i n such cases go up to 100
percent on a selective basis.
The Peruvian Constitution limits the financing o f pennanent spending with indebtedness
proceeds. However, i f the spending i s executed within a project, which by definition has no
pennanent nature, such spending (either recurrent or non recurrent) may be financed with loan
proceeds.
On a project by project basis, the Bank would apply the increased flexibility in financing
recurrent costs under a framework o f fiscal sustainability provided that soine o f the following
circumstances apply: (a) emergency social conditions that require the Bank to finance soine
recurrent costs; (b) project specific grounds where there i s a clear demonstration o f the need
for Bank-financed recurrent activities. I n all cases, at the project level, the Bank would take
into account sustainability issues at the project and sector levels. The Bank would continue to
monitor the overall fiscal and debt situation and its implications for recurrent cost financing.
The requirements for local cost financing are met. The Bank may finance local expenditures
i n the proportions required in individual projects, accordingly to local laws and regulations.

The Bank may finance the costs o f taxes and duties associated with project expenditures. Peru
has a moderate level o f taxation. Bank financed projectsiactivities are taxed at the same rate
as the country’s nonnal tax rates. As o f July 2006, there are no taxes or duties that are
identified as unreasonable or discriminatory.
